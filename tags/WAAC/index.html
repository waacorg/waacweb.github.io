<li><strong>William James</strong> – American psychologist and philosopher, founder of functional psychology. He introduced the concept of the “stream of consciousness”, characterizing mental life as a flowing, continuous process, and distinguished multiple aspects of self (material, social, spiritual).

<li><strong>Gilbert Ryle</strong> – British philosopher and Oxford Professor, author of <em>The Concept of Mind</em>, where he critiqued Cartesian dualism as the “ghost in the machine” fallacy. He replaced soul–body dualism with behavior-based analysis, supporting functionalism: mental terms describe dispositions to behave. Ryle’s elimination of non-physical mind entities reinforced approaches focusing on observable functional processes in artificial consciousness. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Ryle">Wikipedia page</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Hilary Putnam</strong> – American philosopher and Harvard Professor who formulated functionalism and the concept of multiple realizability: mental states are defined by their functional roles, independent of physical substrate. Putnam’s thought experiments (e.g., “inverted qualia,” “Super-Spartans”) illustrate functional equivalence. His work underpins the notion that machines fulfilling the correct functional organization could possess minds. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Putnam">Wikipedia page</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Paul Churchland</strong> – Canadian-American philosopher and Emeritus Professor at UC San Diego. A leading advocate of eliminative materialism, he argues that naïve psychological concepts will be replaced by neuroscience.

His digital reality conjecture provides an early framework suggesting consciousness may be simulated within computational substrates at cosmic scale. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse">Wikipedia page</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Selmer Bringsjord</strong> – American cognitive scientist and Professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He devises self-awareness logic puzzles (e.g., the Bringsjord Self-Aware Machine) requiring AI to prove its own existence or derive its state, setting formal tests for machine self-consciousness. Bringsjord also works in machine ethics, establishing logical criteria for moral reasoning in conscious agents. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selmer_Bringsjord">Wikipedia page</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Pierre Teilhard de Chardin</strong> – French Jesuit philosopher and paleontologist. He articulated the concept of the Noosphere and Omega Point, proposing a planetary-scale networked mind evolving toward divine unity. Though theological, his vision parallels contemporary notions of global collective consciousness and suggests future group-level artificial awareness emerging from interconnected intelligence networks. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Teilhard_de_Chardin">Wikipedia page</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Steven Pinker</strong> – Canadian-American cognitive psychologist and Harvard Professor. In works like <em>How the Mind Works</em>, he explains consciousness, language, and cognition in computational terms for broad audiences. Pinker argues mind functions can be studied scientifically and suggests that intelligence does not necessitate subjective qualia, although he acknowledges the hard problem remains unresolved. His popularization underpins public acceptance of computational mind models. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://stevenpinker.com/">Official website</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Friedrich Hayek</strong> – Austrian-British economist and Nobel laureate. In <em>The Sensory Order</em> (1952), he proposed that the brain categorizes perceptions via connectionist networks, predating modern neural nets. Hayek argued that mental constructs emerge from dynamic patterns of neural connectivity. His early specification of sensory encoding in network structures foreshadows artificial neural approaches to perceptual consciousness. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek">Wikipedia page</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Hermann von Helmholtz</strong> – 19th-century German physicist and physician. He pioneered the theory of unconscious inference in perception, describing vision as brain-based hypothesis testing derived from sensory input. His work on neural transmission speed and empirical psychology laid foundations for predictive coding models of perception, now central to many artificial consciousness frameworks emphasizing anticipatory processing. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_von_Helmholtz">Wikipedia page</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Claude Shannon</strong> – American mathematician and electrical engineer, founder of Information Theory. His concepts of entropy and bit provided quantitative measures of information and uncertainty, later adopted by IIT and other integrated information approaches. Shannon’s communication model inspired analogies between neural and digital signaling, establishing metrics for complexity and information flow vital for engineering machine consciousness assessments. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Wikipedia page</a>.</li>
