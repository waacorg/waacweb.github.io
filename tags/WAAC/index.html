<p>We are pleased to announce that May-Britt Moser, Professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, has been elected as an Academician of WAAC for her outstanding contributions to spatial cognitive neuroscience and the brain’s positioning system. </p>
<p><img src="/images/media/63.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Moser is renowned for her pioneering research on grid cells, which revealed a key neural coding mechanism for spatial localization and navigation and led to the shared 2014 Nobel Prize. Her long-standing focus on the hippocampal–entorhinal circuit and space&#x2F;time representations has provided solid biological inspiration for spatial representation learning, autonomous navigation, and contextual memory in artificial systems, advancing research on artificial consciousness and interpretable intelligent agents. </p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Maiken Nedergaard, Co-Director of the Center for Translational Neuromedicine (CTN) at the University of Rochester Medical Center and Professor of Glial Cell Biology at the University of Copenhagen, has been elected as an Academician of WAAC for her pioneering contributions to astrocytes and the glymphatic system, as well as the mechanisms of sleep-dependent clearance of brain metabolites. </p>
<p><img src="/images/media/62.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over the years, Professor Nedergaard has advanced a research program centered on “glia — glymphatic system — sleep-driven clearance — clinical translation,” building an evidential chain from basic science to application: in 2012, her team reported in Science Translational Medicine the brain’s glymphatic system, showing that cerebrospinal fluid can enter and exchange with the parenchyma via perivascular pathways; in 2013, in Science, they showed that sleep or anesthesia expands the interstitial space and markedly enhances clearance, providing a direct physiological account of sleep’s restorative function. Subsequent work in reviews and clinical imaging&#x2F;modeling has continued to extend the field, helping shape evaluation paradigms and intervention strategies anchored in testable “physiological phenotypes of consciousness,” and offering key levers for comparative research on “consciousness–state–function” across artificial and biological systems. </p>

     style="width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">     </p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that Ron Chrisley, Professor of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence in the School of Engineering and Informatics at the University of Sussex and Director of the Centre for Cognitive Science (COGS), has been elected an Academician of WAAC for his systematic contributions to machine consciousness and theories of representation, as well as his construction of methods–architectures–experimental paradigms for complex artificial systems.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/60.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over the years, Professor Chrisley has pursued a research program spanning machine consciousness—synthetic phenomenology—virtual-machine architectures—virtualist representation, building an evidence chain from philosophy to implementable computational architectures: together with Aaron Sloman, he advanced a virtual-machine framework for consciousness, emphasizing self-monitoring and reportability within multi-level software architectures (Virtual Machines and Consciousness); he articulated synthetic phenomenology, advocating the use of artificial agents (robots&#x2F;programs) to characterize and test attributable phenomenal experience; and with Robert W. Clowes he developed “virtualist representation,” offering a new integrative pathway in debates over experience and representation. Taken together, this body of work has provided methodological and technical instruments for testable characterizations of conscious phenotypes, architectural requirements, and evaluation criteria.</p>

<p><img src="/images/media/59.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over the years, Professor Kajita has advanced a research program centered on “neutrinos–detection–oscillation,” building a chain of evidence from methods to applications: within the Super-Kamiokande collaboration he led the atmospheric-neutrino analysis, and a milestone 1998 paper in Physical Review Letters reported a zenith-angle–dependent deficit of muon neutrinos and interpreted it as oscillations, laying the experimental foundation for the claim that neutrinos have mass; his 2015 Nobel Lecture and subsequent reviews traced the arc from the Neutrino’98 announcement through parameter determination and long-baseline confirmations; and during his tenure at the University of Tokyo’s ICRR (Director, 2008–2022) he continually advanced the Kamioka underground experiments and cross-disciplinary collaborations, serving as the leader of the KAGRA gravitational-wave project and establishing a complete chain from ultra-weak signal detection and cross-scale calibration to statistical inference. Taken together, this body of work not only reshaped the standard picture of particle physics, but also provides a testable large-scale detection–inference paradigm for modeling and validating “consciousness cues”—such as selective responsiveness, resource allocation, and global coordination—in complex engineered systems.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Stephen P. Boyd—Samsung Professor in the School of Engineering and Professor of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University—has been elected an Academician of WAAC (World Academy for Artificial Consciousness), in recognition of his pioneering contributions to convex optimization and control engineering, as well as his development of methods–tools–ecosystems for large-scale intelligent systems.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/58.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over the years, Professor Boyd has pursued a research program centered on “convex optimization–control–intelligent systems,” building a chain of evidence from theory to engineering practice: together with Lieven Vandenberghe he co-authored the classic textbook Convex Optimization, systematizing the use of convex analysis and conic programming in engineering; he proposed and popularized the DCP (Disciplined Convex Programming) specification and toolchain (CVX &#x2F; CVXPY &#x2F; Convex.jl, etc.), dramatically lowering the barrier to turning mathematical models into reproducible engineering; his tutorial review on ADMM established a general algorithmic framework for convex optimization in distributed and statistical learning; in embedded and real-time control he developed the CVXGEN code generator, enabling millisecond-scale solves; and his courses (e.g., EE364A: Convex Optimization I) and open resources continue to be updated and to benefit both industry and academia. Taken together, this body of work provides testable optimization modeling and computational pathways for “consciousness cues”—such as selective responsiveness, resource allocation, and global coordination—in complex engineered artificial systems.</p>

<p>Over the years, Professor Bajcsy has pursued a research program centered on “perception–action–interaction,” building a body of work that links theory to engineering practice: in 1988, she published a classic paper in Proceedings of the IEEE that set out a modeling and control framework for Active Perception; in 1978, at the University of Pennsylvania, she founded and led the GRASP Laboratory, establishing a paradigm for robotic perception and multidisciplinary collaboration; and in medical imaging, she and her team introduced elastic matching and digital anatomical atlas methods that helped bring multimodal MRI&#x2F;PET&#x2F;CT registration into clinical practice. Taken together, these contributions provide testable computational models and experimental pathways for understanding and engineering “consciousness cues”—such as selective attention, resource allocation, and cross-modal integration—in complex artificial systems.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Risto J. Ilmoniemi—Chair Professor (Emeritus) of Applied Physics and Senior Advisor in the Department of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering (NBE) at Aalto University—has been elected an Academician of WAAC (World Academy for Artificial Consciousness), in recognition of his contributions to the continuum from technology to cortical excitability to consciousness.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/57.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over the years, Professor Ilmoniemi has developed a research program centered on “technology–cortical excitability–consciousness,” building a chain of evidence from methods to applications: in 1997, NeuroReport first showed that TMS–EEG can quantify cortical reactivity and effective connectivity; in 2018&#x2F;2022, he proposed and realized multi-locus&#x2F;multi-coil TMS (mTMS), enabling electronic targeting and rapid site switching; he leads the ERC Synergy project ConnectToBrain (2019–2026), advancing a closed-loop, multi-locus TMS platform; and he founded Nexstim to drive the industrialization of navigated TMS and TMS–EEG. These advances have made it possible to assess different levels of consciousness by pairing exogenous TMS perturbation with EEG&#x2F;MEG readouts, wherein the Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) shows a marked reduction in cortical response complexity during unconsciousness and a rebound upon awakening.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Rattan Lal, Distinguished University Professor of Soil Science in the School of Environment and Natural Resources at The Ohio State University and Director of the CFAES Rattan Lal Center for Carbon Management and Sequestration (C-MASC), has been elected an Academician of WAAC in recognition of his systematic contributions to soil carbon sequestration and sustainable agricultural practices.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/52.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, Professor Lal has advanced a “soil-centered” pathway for reducing emissions and increasing yields, building an end-to-end evidence chain that connects scientific mechanisms with engineering and policy. In Science (2004), he published a seminal paper quantifying the global potential of croplands and degraded lands as carbon sinks, establishing an integrated framework that links soil carbon, food security, and climate mitigation. He subsequently detailed actionable routes to enhance carbon sequestration—such as conservation tillage and cover crops—in Geoderma (2004) and other literature. At OSU, he leads C-MASC (the Rattan Lal Center), promoting international collaboration and on-the-ground validation for carbon farming and soil health. For his outstanding contributions, he received the 2020 World Food Prize and the 2024 Gulbenkian Prize for Humanity, underscoring the foundational role of his research in global food security and climate governance.</p>

     style="width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">     </p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that Roi Cohen Kadosh, Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Surrey (formerly at the University of Oxford), has been elected an Academician of WAAC in recognition of his systematic contributions to non-invasive brain stimulation and personalized cognitive enhancement, numerical&#x2F;mathematical cognition, and the brain’s excitation&#x2F;inhibition (E&#x2F;I) balance.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/51.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, Professor Cohen Kadosh has advanced a program centered on “individual differences—stimulation control—learning gains,” building a theory-and-engineering evidence chain for “neural stimulation × learning.” In Current Biology (2010), he was the first to show that applying tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation) during learning can produce specific and lasting improvements in numerical ability. In Current Biology (2007), he confirmed the causal role of the parietal cortex in number processing by inducing a “virtual acalculia” with TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation). In Current Biology (2013), together with collaborators, he demonstrated that training combined with tRNS (transcranial random noise stimulation) yields improvements in learning and brain function lasting up to six months. More recently, in PLOS Biology (2025) and npj Digital Medicine (2025), his work has shown, respectively, mechanism-based modulation of mathematics learning gains via functional connectivity and GABAergic signaling, and the feasibility of home-based enhancement of sustained attention through AI-driven personalization.</p>
