</div>
 &emsp;&emsp;At the annual meeting, Academician Hengjin Cai, Vice President of the World Artificial Consciousness Association, summarized the work of the past year and outlined prospects for the future. He stated that, in terms of theoretical exploration, a consensus has been established that consciousness and intelligence share a common origin. At its core, this theory posits that consciousness stems from a form of cognitive inertia evolved by living beings to escape the constraints of physical time and space. Intelligence is defined as the ability to reconstruct causal chains, while consciousness is the experience of a non-local internal world. This framework, he emphasized, serves as a theoretical cornerstone for understanding artificial consciousness. In applied practice, proactive medicine and artificial consciousness have become deeply integrated. Digital twin technology is now being applied in health management, enabling the simulation of individual physiological, psychological, and cognitive patterns to predict disease risks and deliver personalized interventions—thus returning to a human-centered medical philosophy. Regarding preparations for the Third World Artificial Consciousness Congress, he proposed focusing on the themes of symbiosis and standardization. He advocated for a new paradigm of human-machine integration in which human values become embedded within AI itself. At the same time, he stressed that the standardization committee must develop a forward-looking and inclusive ethical framework. He concluded by underscoring that artificial consciousness is a civilizational issue and called for global collaboration to build a safe, trustworthy, and coexistent intelligent future.

 &emsp;&emsp;President Kaixi Fan stated that the core difference between AI and artificial consciousness (AC) lies in their functional orientation and depth of cognition—AI focuses on optimizing efficiency, while AC aims to achieve deeper levels of cognition. Their commonality lies in simulating and extending human intelligence: AI provides the foundation for AC, and AC, in turn, may further drive the evolution of AI. Both remain in the early stages of exploration and face significant technical and ethical challenges. As a design scholar, he noted that AI has evolved into a content creator, prompting reflection on whether machines can possess artistic sensibility and humanistic care. He emphasized the concept of “techno-art fusion” and its intersection with artificial consciousness, stressing the need to design observation interfaces and standards for consciousness. He also pointed out that AI and AC could provide services infused with humanistic care in fields such as proactive medicine. In conclusion, he called for enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration.

</div>
 &emsp;&emsp;Professor Erxiang Dou, in his speech, proposed that artificial consciousness is driving a new paradigm in human civilization, which requires the construction of an appropriate foundation for economic and social governance. He introduced his theory of “Tri-Fairism” (TRIF)—an approach developed through research in digital economic finance, positioned between government and market forces, and aiming for fairness, justice, and the dual objectives of extracting wealth and generating well-being. TRIF is deeply integrated with the DIKWP cognitive model and is designed to address the core issues of releasing creativity and anchoring human welfare during the development of machine consciousness. He emphasized that during the cognitive leaps enabled by the DIKWP model, the TRIF framework should be used to tackle crises of economic fairness (such as preventing algorithmic hegemony) and challenges to consciousness sovereignty (such as constraining the capitalization of neural data). He called on the preparatory committee to promote the development of DIKWP-TRIF tools—capable of quantifying the technical, institutional, and financial attributes of related projects—and to initiate the drafting of global governance principles for the consciousness economy, including defining property rights over neural data. He concluded with well wishes for the success of the annual meeting and the upcoming Third World Artificial Consciousness Congress.

 &emsp;&emsp;Prof. Chunhui Wang delivered a speech titled “From Large Models to World Models.” He pointed out that since the release of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, generative AI has branched into two main areas: large language models (LLMs) and world models. LLMs rely on one-dimensional representation based on text sequences, while multimodal models still suffer from issues such as "hallucinations." In contrast, world models are built upon understanding the laws of the physical world, moving toward three-dimensional digital spaces. Their essence lies in predicting changes in the physical world, which is foundational for the development of embodied intelligence. He argued that achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) hinges on enabling intelligence to comprehend physical laws. AI agents must align with human values and operate within authorized boundaries. He recommended that the Artificial Consciousness Association conduct research into areas such as the neural mechanisms of consciousness, affective computing, AGI, and the integration of ethics and philosophy to ensure that AI development remains aligned with human interests.

 &emsp;&emsp;Dr. Kunguang Wu, one of the secretaries of the International Standardization Committee for AI DIKWP Evaluation, summarized the committee’s work on behalf of the team. He noted that significant progress was made in advancing the DIKWP strategy and practical framework based on artificial consciousness. One of the most notable achievements was the official release of 10 benchmark standards for evaluating artificial consciousness. These standards cover key areas such as concepts, DIKWP under semantics, mathematics, systems, assessment testing, creativity hallucination, safety, debate, art, and emotion. This milestone represents a major collaborative effort and marks a critical step in defining evaluation protocols. He expressed gratitude to the committee members for their support and shared that his involvement in tasks such as meeting coordination and document preparation deepened his appreciation for teamwork and the importance of standardization. Looking ahead, he hopes to further develop his professional capabilities, enhance administrative efficiency, and explore new rules to support academic innovation.
