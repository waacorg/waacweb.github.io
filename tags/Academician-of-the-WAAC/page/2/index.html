     style="width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">     </p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that Rattan Lal, Distinguished University Professor of Soil Science in the School of Environment and Natural Resources at The Ohio State University and Director of the CFAES Rattan Lal Center for Carbon Management and Sequestration (C-MASC), has been elected an Academician of WAAC in recognition of his systematic contributions to soil carbon sequestration and sustainable agricultural practices.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/52.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, Professor Lal has advanced a “soil-centered” pathway for reducing emissions and increasing yields, building an end-to-end evidence chain that connects scientific mechanisms with engineering and policy. In Science (2004), he published a seminal paper quantifying the global potential of croplands and degraded lands as carbon sinks, establishing an integrated framework that links soil carbon, food security, and climate mitigation. He subsequently detailed actionable routes to enhance carbon sequestration—such as conservation tillage and cover crops—in Geoderma (2004) and other literature. At OSU, he leads C-MASC (the Rattan Lal Center), promoting international collaboration and on-the-ground validation for carbon farming and soil health. For his outstanding contributions, he received the 2020 World Food Prize and the 2024 Gulbenkian Prize for Humanity, underscoring the foundational role of his research in global food security and climate governance.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Morten Peter Meldal, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Copenhagen, has been elected an Academician of WAAC in recognition of his systematic contributions to click chemistry and the copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC).</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/53.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, Professor Meldal has built an evidence chain from methods to applications around “rapid, highly selective modular ligation.” In J. Org. Chem. (2002), together with collaborators, he first reported the Cu(I)-catalyzed, regioselective 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between terminal alkynes and azides (CuAAC), laying the foundation for the reaction’s chemistry and for applications in both solid- and solution-phase settings. In Chemical Reviews (2008), he systematically summarized the mechanism, reaction conditions, and wide-ranging uses of CuAAC in peptide and polymer chemistry and in the functionalization of surfaces and nanostructures, establishing “click chemistry” as an efficient, robust, and combinatorial universal ligation paradigm. For “the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry,” he received the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (shared with K. Barry Sharpless and Carolyn R. Bertozzi). Related methods are now widely applied in drug discovery, DNA labeling, and materials creation.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Roi Reichart, Professor in the Faculty of Data and Decision Sciences at the Technion–Israel Institute of Technology, Schmidt Career Advancement Chair in AI, and Co-Editor-in-Chief of TACL (Transactions of the ACL), has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) in recognition of his systematic contributions to language and AI, interpretability, and robust learning.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/55.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, Professor Reichart has pursued a program centered on “language—interpretability—robustness,” building an evidence chain from methods to applications: at CoNLL 2017 he proposed Neural Structural Correspondence Learning (NSCL) for cross-domain representation learning and transfer; at ACL 2019 he constructed and studied a zero-shot semantic parsing task and dataset; at NAACL 2025 he provided a stakeholder-centric survey of model interpretability in the LLM era (awarded Best Paper in the Model Analysis and Interpretability track). In addition, as a co-author of a survey on causal inference × NLP, he has advanced a unified perspective on leveraging causal methods to improve model robustness, fairness, and interpretability. Collectively, these works offer testable computational models and experimental pathways for understanding and engineering “consciousness cues” in complex artificial systems—such as selective responses, resource allocation, and global coordination. The Technion NLP Lab likewise designates interpretability and robustness as core research directions, sustaining cross-lingual, cross-domain, and interdisciplinary progress.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Ronald L. Rivest, Institute Professor at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), has been elected an Academician of WAAC in recognition of his systematic contributions to public-key cryptography, symmetric cryptography, cryptographic hashing, and election security.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/54.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, Professor Rivest has advanced a program centered on “verifiable security,” building an evidence chain from foundational cryptography to socio-technical systems: In Communications of the ACM (1978), he published the original RSA paper, establishing the practical paradigm of modern public-key cryptography; in IETF RFC 1321 (1992), he released the MD5 algorithm, helping drive the widespread use of digital signatures and integrity checking; in 1994&#x2F;1995, he proposed the parameterizable, implementation-simple RC5 block cipher, demonstrating the engineering feasibility of high-performance symmetric encryption; in a USENIX EVT 2007 paper, he introduced the ThreeBallot&#x2F;VAV&#x2F;Twin family of verifiable voting protocols, exploring publicly auditable elections without trusted specialized devices; and the RSA patent, co-invented with collaborators, laid key legal and engineering foundations for secure communications and e-commerce infrastructure.</p>

<p>We are delighted to announce that Peter J. Bentley, Honorary Professor and Teaching Fellow in the Department of Computer Science at University College London (UCL), has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) in recognition of his systematic contributions to bio-inspired evolutionary computation, self-organizing systems, and artificial immune computation.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/50.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over the years, Professor Bentley has pursued a unifying theme of “evolution and self-organization,” building a chain of theoretical and engineering evidence from evolutionary design and creative evolutionary systems to artificial immune systems (AIS): in Evolutionary Design by Computers (Morgan Kaufmann, 1999), which he edited, he systematically argued for the generative power of evolutionary algorithms in engineering and product design; in Creative Evolutionary Systems (Academic Press &#x2F; Morgan Kaufmann, 2002), he broadened evolutionary-generative methods to creative domains including art, music, and architecture; at GECCO (2001) and in subsequent papers (2001–2002), together with collaborators he proposed AIS for network intrusion detection, integrating negative selection, clonal selection, and gene-library evolution and developing the Dynamic Clonal Selection (DynamiCS) framework; subsequent surveys systematically reviewed immune-inspired intrusion detection, highlighting the self-organizing, distributed, and robust properties of these approaches. Taken together, these works provide testable computational models and experimental pathways for understanding “consciousness cues” in artificial systems—such as selective response, resource allocation, and global coordination—and point to practical routes toward scalable, resilient intelligent behavior.</p>

     style="width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">     </p>
<p>We are delighted to announce that Michael S. A. Graziano, Professor at Princeton University’s Neuroscience Institute and Department of Psychology and Director of the Graziano Lab (Consciousness &amp; the Social Brain), has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC). He is recognized for proposing and systematically developing the Attention Schema Theory (AST) and for his pioneering contributions to the neural and computational mechanisms of consciousness, social cognition, and engineering pathways toward realizable artificial consciousness.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/48.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over the years, Professor Graziano has taken the coupling between attention and consciousness as a guiding thread, building a cross-level chain of evidence from neurophysiology to computational models and engineering demonstrations: in his Oxford University Press monograph Consciousness and the Social Brain (2013), he advanced a social-brain framework that explains subjective consciousness through an “attention schema”; in Frontiers in Psychology (2015), he provided a systematic, mechanistic exposition of AST; in Frontiers in Robotics &amp; AI (2017), he further argued for AST as a foundation for “engineered artificial consciousness”; in Progress in Neurobiology (2020), he showed through behavioral training and modeling that “attention control depends on internal models”; in PNAS (2019, 2020), together with collaborators he proposed—and demonstrated with behavioral and fMRI evidence—that humans implicitly encode others’ gaze as “force beams&#x2F;implicit motion” emanating from the eyes, linking social-attention representations across key nodes such as the TPJ and MT+; and in PNAS (2021), he further demonstrated within a neural-network regime that introducing an attention schema can markedly improve endogenous attention control. Earlier, his work in Science (1994) on premotor encoding of peripersonal space laid a neurophysiological foundation for his subsequent trajectory from the space–action interface to models of social attention.</p>

     style="width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">     </p>
<p>We are delighted to announce that Philip H. S. Torr (FREng, FRS), Professor in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford and Head of the Torr Vision Group (TVG), has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) in recognition of his pioneering contributions to deep learning for scene understanding and recognition, visual object tracking and segmentation, and robust estimation and model selection.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/49.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over the years, Professor Torr has followed a unifying trajectory “from robust geometry to end-to-end deep vision,” establishing a chain of results spanning modeling, learning, inference, and real-time applications: in Computer Vision and Image Understanding (2000), he proposed the MLESAC framework for robust estimation, markedly improving the noise tolerance of geometric model fitting; in the International Journal of Computer Vision (2002), he advanced Bayesian model estimation and selection (including the MAPSAC&#x2F;GRIC line of ideas), laying the groundwork for automatic selection in multi-body&#x2F;multi-model contexts; entering the deep-learning era, at ICCV (2015) he introduced CRF-RNN, integrating conditional random fields with convolutional networks in an end-to-end, backpropagatable architecture that significantly sharpened fine-grained boundaries for semantic segmentation; subsequently, at the ECCV Workshops (2016) he presented the fully convolutional Siamese network (SiamFC), bringing general object tracking into a real-time, end-to-end paradigm; at CVPR (2019), he and collaborators unified single-object tracking (SOT) and video object segmentation (VOS) in SiamMask, achieving real-time segmentation–tracking synergy at 55 FPS.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Ned Block, Silver Professor of Philosophy and Psychology at New York University, has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) in recognition of his foundational contributions to distinguishing and deepening the theories of phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/47.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, Professor Block has advanced the phenomenal–access framework through systematic theory and interdisciplinary evidence: in the classic paper “On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness” (Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 1995), he drew a clear distinction between the consciousness of experience and the consciousness that is available for thought and report; in “Consciousness, Accessibility, and the Mesh between Psychology and Neuroscience” (Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 2007), he articulated how accessibility interfaces with evidence from psychology and neuroscience; and in Trends in Cognitive Sciences (2011), he advanced the overflow argument, using iconic-memory paradigms to show that what we are conscious of often exceeds what is immediately reportable or usable in cognition. Collectively, this work has reshaped the boundaries of research on reportability and subjective experience and provided a robust theoretical foundation for artificial consciousness and cognitive modeling.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Michael N. Shadlen, Professor of Neuroscience at Columbia University and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator, has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) in recognition of his sustained contributions to the neural mechanisms of perceptual decision-making and to evidence-accumulation processes related to conscious accessibility.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/45.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, Professor Shadlen has used random-dot motion (RDM) paradigms and single-neuron recordings to demonstrate that neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) represent evidence accumulation and threshold (bound) crossing in decision-making (Journal of Neurophysiology, 2001). Together with Joshua I. Gold, he articulated a comprehensive neural framework “from evidence integration to commitment” in Annual Review of Neuroscience (2007). His team has also reported, in human studies, the critical process by which an “aha” moment enters awareness (Current Biology, 2017; accompanied by a Columbia University news release), and showed in Neuron (2022) that parietal decision representations can generalize across fixed reference frames. Collectively, these studies link decision formation to conscious accessibility from single units to systems, providing key evidence for how the brain transforms unconscious processing into reportable conscious contents.</p>

     style="width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">     </p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that Michael X. Cohen, neuroscientist at Radboud University Medical Center and the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) in recognition of his sustained contributions to neural oscillations and neural time-series analysis—especially advances in time–frequency methods, cross-frequency coupling, and empirically determining frequency-band boundaries.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/46.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, Professor Cohen has pursued a continuous research program on how oscillatory dynamics characterize information processing and help identify consciousness-related representations. His MIT Press monograph, Analyzing Neural Time Series Data, established a comprehensive framework for time–frequency and synchrony analyses of EEG&#x2F;MEG&#x2F;LFP. In Journal of Neurophysiology (2013), he reported the relationship between midfrontal theta and conflict monitoring&#x2F;behavioral prediction, yielding quantifiable markers of reportable control and arousal regulation. In eLife (2017), he introduced a multichannel cross-frequency coupling method based on generalized eigen-decomposition (gedCFC), enabling the detection of integrative cross-frequency pathways in multichannel data. In Journal of Neuroscience Methods (2021), he further proposed gedBounds to derive individualized frequency-band boundaries in a data-driven manner. Complementing these methods, his authoritative review in Trends in Neurosciences (2017) clarified the sources, interpretations, and limits of EEG signals. Collectively, these contributions have expanded testable routes from oscillatory integration to metrics of consciousness.</p>
