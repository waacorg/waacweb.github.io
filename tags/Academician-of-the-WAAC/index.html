     style="width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">     </p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Timothy F. Brady, a professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), has been elected as an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) for his pioneering research in the relationship between visual working memory and consciousness.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/68.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Brady has long been dedicated to studying how humans process and store visual information, with a particular focus on the intersection of visual working memory, perception, and consciousness. He has proposed several theories regarding the capacity for visual information processing and has employed various experimental methods to explore how the brain maintains sensitivity to complex visual stimuli under limited cognitive resources. His research has provided new perspectives on understanding memory capacity, attention mechanisms, and the interactions between perception and consciousness, significantly advancing both theoretical and applied research in this field. Building on this foundation, Professor Brady leads the UCSD Visual Working Memory and Consciousness Lab, conducting interdisciplinary research that includes computational models, neuroscience experiments, and applied studies (such as multitasking and the optimization of visual interfaces). This research continues to deepen our understanding of the role and impact of visual working memory in complex environments. His contributions have not only influenced basic scientific research but also provided valuable theoretical support for practical applications, particularly in the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive computing.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Asada of Osaka University and Osaka University of Information Technology in Japan has been elected as an Academician of WAAC for his outstanding contributions to cognitive developmental robotics, artificial empathy, and artificial consciousness.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/64.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Asada has long been devoted to exploring implementable mechanisms of consciousness and empathy in artificial systems. He has systematically proposed a brain-inspired computational framework centered on pain and touch, advocating the embedding of human-like nociceptive&#x2F;tactile neural systems in robots, combined with mirror-neuron mechanisms, to drive the hierarchical emergence from emotional contagion to empathy to a sense of morality. His representative work, Artificial Pain May Induce Empathy, Morality, and Ethics in the Conscious Mind of Robots (2019), along with related reviews, has had a wide impact in academia and has become an important reference for research on artificial empathy and artificial consciousness.</p>

     style="width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">     </p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Nicholas G. Hatsopoulos—Professor in the Department of Organismal Biology &amp; Anatomy at The University of Chicago and a core member of the interdisciplinary programs in Neuroscience and Computational Neuroscience—has been elected as an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) for his outstanding contributions to motor cortex coding, population neurocomputation, and brain–computer interfaces (BCIs).</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/66.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Hatsopoulos has long been devoted to uncovering how the motor cortex encodes and generates movement. His team proposed and validated the “movement fragments”&#x2F;preferred-trajectory coding view: individual motor-cortex neurons exhibit selectivity for time-evolving movement trajectories rather than merely tuning to instantaneous kinematic parameters, helping drive a paradigm shift from “static tuning” to “temporal trajectory” frameworks. In BCIs and neuroprosthetics, his group has significantly enhanced device stability and usability through closed-loop sensory feedback and population-activity decoding, with multiple University of Chicago news and research reports demonstrating how tactile&#x2F;proprioceptive feedback improves performance and its potential for clinical translation.</p>

<p>Professor Lavie has long focused on the mechanisms of human attentional selection and consciousness, systematically proposing and developing Load Theory: under high perceptual load, individuals’ ability to process irrelevant stimuli is significantly reduced, giving rise to phenomena such as distraction suppression and “inattentional&#x2F;unaware” effects. This theory has been landmark in reconciling the early–late selection debate and in explaining distraction and misses in complex real-world environments. Building on this foundation, Professor Lavie leads UCL’s Attention and Cognitive Control laboratory in cross-disciplinary work spanning cognitive neuroscience, computational modeling, and applied settings (e.g., human–machine interaction in driving, distraction management in education), advancing a tight theory–evidence loop on the relationship between attention and consciousness. She has also been elected to the British Academy (FBA) and recognized with honors from organizations such as the British Psychological Society and the Experimental Psychology Society. </p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Nicola S. Clayton—Professor of Comparative Cognition in the Department of Psychology at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS, elected 2010)—has been elected as an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) for her outstanding contributions to corvid cognition, future planning, and signs of consciousness.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/65.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Using corvids (such as the western scrub-jay) as model species, Professor Clayton has long and systematically revealed episodic-like memory and future-oriented planning in nonhuman animals: her team provided the first behavioral evidence of “what–where–when” memory in Nature (1998), and further showed in Nature (2007) that scrub-jays can prepare for tomorrow, challenging the view that future planning is unique to humans. These studies offer milestone evidence for understanding animal intelligence and indicators of consciousness, and have profoundly influenced the development of comparative cognition.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Maiken Nedergaard, Co-Director of the Center for Translational Neuromedicine (CTN) at the University of Rochester Medical Center and Professor of Glial Cell Biology at the University of Copenhagen, has been elected as an Academician of WAAC for her pioneering contributions to astrocytes and the glymphatic system, as well as the mechanisms of sleep-dependent clearance of brain metabolites. </p>
<p><img src="/images/media/62.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over the years, Professor Nedergaard has advanced a research program centered on “glia — glymphatic system — sleep-driven clearance — clinical translation,” building an evidential chain from basic science to application: in 2012, her team reported in Science Translational Medicine the brain’s glymphatic system, showing that cerebrospinal fluid can enter and exchange with the parenchyma via perivascular pathways; in 2013, in Science, they showed that sleep or anesthesia expands the interstitial space and markedly enhances clearance, providing a direct physiological account of sleep’s restorative function. Subsequent work in reviews and clinical imaging&#x2F;modeling has continued to extend the field, helping shape evaluation paradigms and intervention strategies anchored in testable “physiological phenotypes of consciousness,” and offering key levers for comparative research on “consciousness–state–function” across artificial and biological systems. </p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Ron Chrisley, Professor of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence in the School of Engineering and Informatics at the University of Sussex and Director of the Centre for Cognitive Science (COGS), has been elected an Academician of WAAC for his systematic contributions to machine consciousness and theories of representation, as well as his construction of methods–architectures–experimental paradigms for complex artificial systems.</p>

<p>Over the years, Professor Chrisley has pursued a research program spanning machine consciousness—synthetic phenomenology—virtual-machine architectures—virtualist representation, building an evidence chain from philosophy to implementable computational architectures: together with Aaron Sloman, he advanced a virtual-machine framework for consciousness, emphasizing self-monitoring and reportability within multi-level software architectures (Virtual Machines and Consciousness); he articulated synthetic phenomenology, advocating the use of artificial agents (robots&#x2F;programs) to characterize and test attributable phenomenal experience; and with Robert W. Clowes he developed “virtualist representation,” offering a new integrative pathway in debates over experience and representation. Taken together, this body of work has provided methodological and technical instruments for testable characterizations of conscious phenotypes, architectural requirements, and evaluation criteria.</p>

     style="width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">     </p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Takaaki Kajita—Distinguished University Professor at the University of Tokyo and former Director of the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research (ICRR)—has been elected an Academician of WAAC (World Academy for Artificial Consciousness), in recognition of his systematic contributions to the discovery of atmospheric neutrino oscillations and to underground, ultra–large-volume detection experiments.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/59.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over the years, Professor Kajita has advanced a research program centered on “neutrinos–detection–oscillation,” building a chain of evidence from methods to applications: within the Super-Kamiokande collaboration he led the atmospheric-neutrino analysis, and a milestone 1998 paper in Physical Review Letters reported a zenith-angle–dependent deficit of muon neutrinos and interpreted it as oscillations, laying the experimental foundation for the claim that neutrinos have mass; his 2015 Nobel Lecture and subsequent reviews traced the arc from the Neutrino’98 announcement through parameter determination and long-baseline confirmations; and during his tenure at the University of Tokyo’s ICRR (Director, 2008–2022) he continually advanced the Kamioka underground experiments and cross-disciplinary collaborations, serving as the leader of the KAGRA gravitational-wave project and establishing a complete chain from ultra-weak signal detection and cross-scale calibration to statistical inference. Taken together, this body of work not only reshaped the standard picture of particle physics, but also provides a testable large-scale detection–inference paradigm for modeling and validating “consciousness cues”—such as selective responsiveness, resource allocation, and global coordination—in complex engineered systems.</p>
