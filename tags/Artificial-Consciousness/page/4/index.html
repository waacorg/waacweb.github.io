<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Françoise Barré-Sinoussi of the Institut Pasteur in France, recipient of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, has been honored with the title of academician of the World Academy of Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) for her pioneering contributions to research on HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/25.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>In 1983, Professor Barré-Sinoussi first isolated HIV from the lymph nodes of patients with AIDS, laying the groundwork for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Her research not only advanced early detection methods for HIV but also provided a scientific basis for the development of antiretroviral therapies. Beyond her laboratory work, Professor Barré-Sinoussi has been deeply engaged in global HIV&#x2F;AIDS prevention and control, with a particular focus on fostering research collaboration and capacity building in resource-limited settings. She has served as president of the International AIDS Society (IAS) and has held key roles on multiple international scientific committees.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Ezequiel Morsella, professor of psychology at San Francisco State University and a scholar of consciousness and action control, has been elected an academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) for his foundational work on Passive Frame Theory (PFT), the mechanisms by which conscious contents are generated, and the role of consciousness in voluntary action selection.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/26.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, Professor Morsella has used a combined theoretical and experimental approach to systematically reveal the “passive yet necessary” role of consciousness in the selection of voluntary skeletomotor actions. Presented as a target article in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, his formulation and synthesis of PFT offers a new integrative framework for clarifying the functional boundaries and implementation mechanisms of consciousness. Meanwhile, public- and campus-facing research communications from his team have showcased evidence that complex ideas can enter consciousness involuntarily, further supporting the view that conscious contents can be generated automatically.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Étienne Koechlin, a cognitive neuroscientist at École Normale Supérieure (PSL), has been elected an academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) for his foundational research on hierarchical control in the prefrontal cortex, rule–value integration, and conscious planning.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/27.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, Professor Koechlin has combined theory with human neuroimaging to propose a cascade architecture of lateral prefrontal executive control: a posterior-to-anterior hierarchy along the rostro–caudal axis in which successively anterior regions regulate behavior according to stimuli, context, and temporal episodes. This framework established the neural basis of modern research on “hierarchical control.” He subsequently used an information-theoretic approach to characterize how executive functions integrate information across multiple prefrontal subdivisions to achieve unified action selection. In recent work, his team has revealed how the prefrontal cortex integrates reward expectations and beliefs under uncertainty to guide human decision-making.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Cathy Price, Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at UCL’s Queen Square Institute of Neurology and a Fellow of the Royal Society, has been elected an academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) for her foundational contributions to the language network and reading mechanisms, the PLORAS framework for predicting post-stroke language recovery, and the neural basis of conscious comprehension.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/28.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, Professor Price has used large-sample neuroimaging and clinical datasets to reveal organizational principles of the human brain’s language network, and she founded the PLORAS project, pioneering methods that predict aphasia recovery trajectories from a single structural scan combined with clinical variables. Related reviews and methodological papers have systematically summarized key evidence and challenges—for example, “Predicting Language Outcome and Recovery After Stroke” and “The PLORAS Database.” Her earlier highly cited reviews integrated imaging evidence on speech perception, speech production, and reading, providing a robust foundation for network-based mechanisms of conscious understanding.</p>

     style="width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">     </p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Geraint Rees, Vice-Provost of UCL, has been elected an academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) for his foundational contributions to the neural mechanisms of conscious contents and attention, brain networks, and computational decoding.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/29.png"

<p>Over many years, Professor Rees has used functional imaging (fMRI) and multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to systematically reveal the neural correlates of visual consciousness, while advancing both the methodology and ethical discourse surrounding “brain readout&#x2F;mind decoding.” His work has laid an important foundation for data-driven characterization linking conscious representations, large-scale brain networks, and computable readouts. Beyond basic research, Professor Rees has played key roles in academic governance and the innovation ecosystem, and has spearheaded initiatives that promote cross-disciplinary translation and international partnerships at the scientific frontier.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor H. Robert Horvitz has been elected an academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) for his foundational contributions to programmed cell death (apoptosis) and neural&#x2F;developmental genetics in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans).</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/30.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, the Horvitz laboratory used C. elegans to establish the canonical genetic pathway of programmed cell death: ced-3 and ced-4 are essential for cell death, whereas ced-9 acts anti-apoptotically; subsequent work showed that egl-1 initiates cell death by inhibiting CED-9, releasing CED-4, and thereby activating CED-3. This pathway provided the genetic blueprint for the mammalian BCL-2–APAF-1–caspase system. These discoveries not only elucidated the molecular basis of development and the sculpting of neural circuits, but also opened new avenues for research on cancer, immunity, and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Ehud Ahissar, a professor in the Department of Neurobiology at the Weizmann Institute of Science, has been awarded the honor of being elected as an academician of the World Academy of Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) for his outstanding contributions to the fields of tactile perception, active perception mechanisms, and perceptual embodiment theory.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/19.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Ahissar has long been dedicated to researching the closed-loop mechanisms of perception, proposing that perception is not only an internal process of the brain but is also closely related to bodily movements and interactions with the environment. He emphasizes that perception is an embodiment of the interaction between the body and the environment. His research findings are of significant importance for understanding the mechanisms of perception and the formation of consciousness.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that, in recognition of his foundational contributions to concept and category learning, folk biology, and research on culture–cognition interactions, Professor Douglas Medin of the Department of Psychology at Northwestern University has been elected an Academician of the World Academy of Artificial Consciousness (WAAC).</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/15.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Medin’s Context Theory&#x2F;exemplar model reshaped scholarly understanding of human concepts and categorization: classification judgments can be driven directly by similarity to stored “instances” in memory, rather than relying solely on abstract prototypes and rules. Validated through rigorous experimental paradigms, this framework established exemplar-based learning and reasoning as a central pathway and a key baseline for subsequent work in category learning and representational modeling.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Diana Reiss—professor at the City University of New York and an animal cognition scientist—has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness in recognition of her foundational work on dolphin mirror self-recognition, interspecies communication, and animal consciousness.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/17.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, Professor Reiss has used systematic experimental paradigms to reveal self-representation and social cognition in nonhuman animals: with collaborators, she reported in PNAS (2001) the first demonstration of mirror self-recognition (MSR) in bottlenose dolphins; subsequently documented MSR in Asian elephants in PNAS (2006); and, in PLOS ONE (2018), showed that juvenile dolphins exhibit early markers of self-awareness. These findings expand the comparative-cognition boundaries of the “self” and provide cross-species reference points for research on the origins and evolution of consciousness.</p>
