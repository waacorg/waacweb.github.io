<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Geraint Rees, Vice-Provost of UCL, has been elected an academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) for his foundational contributions to the neural mechanisms of conscious contents and attention, brain networks, and computational decoding.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/29.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, Professor Rees has used functional imaging (fMRI) and multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to systematically reveal the neural correlates of visual consciousness, while advancing both the methodology and ethical discourse surrounding “brain readout&#x2F;mind decoding.” His work has laid an important foundation for data-driven characterization linking conscious representations, large-scale brain networks, and computable readouts. Beyond basic research, Professor Rees has played key roles in academic governance and the innovation ecosystem, and has spearheaded initiatives that promote cross-disciplinary translation and international partnerships at the scientific frontier.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor H. Robert Horvitz has been elected an academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) for his foundational contributions to programmed cell death (apoptosis) and neural&#x2F;developmental genetics in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans).</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/30.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, the Horvitz laboratory used C. elegans to establish the canonical genetic pathway of programmed cell death: ced-3 and ced-4 are essential for cell death, whereas ced-9 acts anti-apoptotically; subsequent work showed that egl-1 initiates cell death by inhibiting CED-9, releasing CED-4, and thereby activating CED-3. This pathway provided the genetic blueprint for the mammalian BCL-2–APAF-1–caspase system. These discoveries not only elucidated the molecular basis of development and the sculpting of neural circuits, but also opened new avenues for research on cancer, immunity, and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Ehud Ahissar, a professor in the Department of Neurobiology at the Weizmann Institute of Science, has been awarded the honor of being elected as an academician of the World Academy of Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) for his outstanding contributions to the fields of tactile perception, active perception mechanisms, and perceptual embodiment theory.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/19.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Ahissar has long been dedicated to researching the closed-loop mechanisms of perception, proposing that perception is not only an internal process of the brain but is also closely related to bodily movements and interactions with the environment. He emphasizes that perception is an embodiment of the interaction between the body and the environment. His research findings are of significant importance for understanding the mechanisms of perception and the formation of consciousness.</p>

     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Sagi has long been dedicated to exploring the plasticity of the visual system, revealing how perceptual learning influences perceptual stability and conscious experience. His research shows that perceptual learning not only enhances sensitivity to visual stimuli but also affects current perceptual reports through sequence dependence, highlighting the importance of visual memory in the generalization of learning.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Ellen Langer of the Department of Psychology at Harvard University— a pioneer of mindfulness research—has been elected an Academician of the World Academy of Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) in recognition of her foundational contributions and cross-disciplinary impact in mindfulness centered on context and active attention (a non-meditative approach), mind–body unity, and the illusion of control.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/16.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>As a Harvard psychologist, Professor Langer proposed the Langerian mindfulness framework built around “actively noticing novelty,” systematically investigated the causal pathways linking mindset with health, learning, and decision-making, and on this basis advocated a theoretical orientation of mind–body unity. Her general-audience book The Mindful Body (2023) synthesizes more than forty years of evidence, demonstrating the potential influence of mindset and contextual design on physiological indicators and the management of chronic disease.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that, in recognition of his foundational contributions to concept and category learning, folk biology, and research on culture–cognition interactions, Professor Douglas Medin of the Department of Psychology at Northwestern University has been elected an Academician of the World Academy of Artificial Consciousness (WAAC).</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/15.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Medin’s Context Theory&#x2F;exemplar model reshaped scholarly understanding of human concepts and categorization: classification judgments can be driven directly by similarity to stored “instances” in memory, rather than relying solely on abstract prototypes and rules. Validated through rigorous experimental paradigms, this framework established exemplar-based learning and reasoning as a central pathway and a key baseline for subsequent work in category learning and representational modeling.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Diana Reiss—professor at the City University of New York and an animal cognition scientist—has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness in recognition of her foundational work on dolphin mirror self-recognition, interspecies communication, and animal consciousness.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/17.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, Professor Reiss has used systematic experimental paradigms to reveal self-representation and social cognition in nonhuman animals: with collaborators, she reported in PNAS (2001) the first demonstration of mirror self-recognition (MSR) in bottlenose dolphins; subsequently documented MSR in Asian elephants in PNAS (2006); and, in PLOS ONE (2018), showed that juvenile dolphins exhibit early markers of self-awareness. These findings expand the comparative-cognition boundaries of the “self” and provide cross-species reference points for research on the origins and evolution of consciousness.</p>

<p>The World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) hereby appoints Professor Chunhui Wang as Chief Data Officer (CDO). Professor Wang is an internationally renowned expert in the rule of law for networks and data, data governance and compliance, and the regulation of generative AI, with deep scholarly grounding and policy practice in cross-border data flows, personal information protection, and AI governance.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/chw.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Wang currently serves as President of the International Data Association (IDA); Dean of the United Nations World Silk Road Forum Institute for Digital Economy; Chief Expert for Decision-Making Consultation at the China Association for Science and Technology (CAST); Member of the Expert Committee on Information and Communications Economy under China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT); and Vice President of the World Association for Artificial Consciousness (WACA). He has long been committed to advancing the rule-of-law-based and internationalized development of the data-elements market. He proposed a data property-rights framework centered on “data resource ownership — data processing and usage rights — data product operation rights,” advocating the use of the rule of law to promote secure governance and innovative growth of the data-elements market. In the domain of public-data development and utilization, he has systematically elucidated the milestone significance of the “1+3” policy framework and put forward regulatory proposals such as “dynamic fair-competition review,” providing important theoretical support for data licensing&#x2F;operations and fair competition. As Chief Data Officer, Professor Wang will build a compliant data-asset system and audit framework to serve artificial consciousness research, helping achieve controllable, verifiable, and responsible development of artificial-consciousness systems.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Steven Pinker—Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard University and a renowned cognitive scientist—has been elected an Honorary Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC), in recognition of his outstanding contributions to language, cognition, and the computational theory of mind, as well as his sustained impact on public reason and science communication.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/1.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Steven Pinker is a professor in Harvard’s Department of Psychology whose research spans visual cognition, psycholinguistics, and social cognition. A leading advocate of the “computational mind” and evolutionary psychology, he has articulated the view that the mind is an information-processing system shaped by natural selection, providing a theoretical framework for understanding human cognition and building intelligent systems. His research and books on language acquisition, the structure of the mind, and rationality have exerted a lasting influence on both public discourse and academic debates about human nature and reason.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that, in recognition of her foundational contributions to human memory malleability and eyewitness testimony, Professor Elizabeth Loftus of the University of California has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/14.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>A leading figure in contemporary memory science and legal psychology, Professor Loftus has systematically revealed the misinformation effect and the plasticity of memory: post-event information and leading questions introduced after an incident can alter both the content of a person’s recollection and their confidence in it. The classic “car accident wording” experiment by Loftus and Palmer first demonstrated, with rigorous experimental paradigms, how linguistic cues reshape eyewitness recall and judgment. Over the ensuing three decades, further research delineated the conditions under which individuals are more or less susceptible to misleading information, and explored false-memory induction paradigms—such as the “lost in the mall” technique—in healthy populations, along with their ethical implications. This body of work has profoundly influenced investigative procedures, the assessment of eyewitness testimony in courts, and public policy worldwide.</p>
