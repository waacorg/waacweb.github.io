<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Fred H. ‚ÄúRusty‚Äù Gage of the Laboratory of Genetics at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC), in recognition of his foundational contributions to adult neurogenesis and neural plasticity, the effects of physical activity and enriched environments on brain function, and neuronal genomic diversity driven by L1 (LINE-1) retrotransposons.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/32.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, Professor Gage has led a sustained research program in adult neurogenesis. His collaborative work provided direct evidence that the adult human hippocampus continues to generate new neurons and showed that voluntary exercise and environmental enrichment can significantly promote neurogenesis and enhance learning and memory‚Äîoverturning a long-standing textbook assumption. He has also proposed and substantiated key mechanisms of neuronal genomic mosaicism, revealing the activity of L1 retrotransposons in neural progenitors and neurons and its relationship to diversity in brain function. These advances have provided important underpinnings for understanding the biological basis of consciousness and cognition.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Jingnan Liu‚ÄîAcademician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and Professor at Wuhan University (former President of Wuhan University and founding President of Duke Kunshan University)‚Äîhas been elected a Honorary Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC), in recognition of his systematic and pioneering contributions to geodetic reference frame theory, BeiDou&#x2F;GNSS high-precision positioning technologies, spatiotemporal intelligence, and core software R&amp;D and major engineering applications.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/33.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over the years, Professor Liu has led sustained efforts in the fundamental theories and key technologies of satellite navigation and positioning: he established China‚Äôs first Continuous Operating Reference Stations (CORS) system, oversaw the overall design of the national BeiDou Ground-Based Augmentation System, and spearheaded the first provincial-level BeiDou augmentation system in Hubei Province. His team developed internationally influential precision data-processing software for satellite navigation and multi-constellation precise-orbit determination methods, and conquered critical challenges in high-precision data processing for the heterogeneous BeiDou constellation, providing a solid foundation for the engineering deployment and large-scale application of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Giacomo Rizzolatti, Professor Emeritus of Physiology at the University of Parma and a pioneering figure in mirror-neuron research, has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC), in recognition of his foundational contributions to the discovery and mechanistic elucidation of mirror neurons, action understanding and social cognition, and self‚Äìother representation and consciousness. </p>
<p><img src="/images/media/34.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over the past decades, Professor Rizzolatti and the ‚ÄúParma school‚Äù have systematically revealed the mirror-neuron mechanism: his team first reported mirror neurons in the macaque ventral premotor cortex (area F5) and proposed their key role in action understanding and imitation; subsequent work helped establish the mirror-neuron system in humans and its broader theoretical framework, advancing research in social cognition and consciousness. In recognition of these advances, he shared The Brain Prize in 2014. </p>

<p>Professor Pulverm√ºller has long been dedicated to uncovering the relationship between language and the brain, proposing the ‚Äúactive perception-action loop‚Äù model, which emphasizes that language comprehension relies not only on the neural circuits of perception and action systems but also on the interaction between these circuits. His research has provided significant neuroscientific foundations for the construction of artificial consciousness and has fostered interdisciplinary collaboration and development.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Greg DeAngelis, a professor in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and a visual neuroscientist at the University of Rochester, has been honored with the title of academician of the World Academy of Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) for his groundbreaking research in the fields of depth perception, stereovision, and conscious perception.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/22.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor DeAngelis has long been dedicated to uncovering how the brain processes stereoscopic visual information, proposing the ‚Äúmotion disparity‚Äù model, which emphasizes the influence of self-motion on depth perception. His research has shown that neurons in the MT area of the monkey brain respond to binocular disparity and contribute to the formation of stereoscopic depth perception. Additionally, his team discovered that neurons in the monkey MT area integrate visual motion and eye movement signals to perceive depth through motion disparity, providing critical insights into how the brain processes three-dimensional information.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Ezequiel Morsella, professor of psychology at San Francisco State University and a scholar of consciousness and action control, has been elected an academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) for his foundational work on Passive Frame Theory (PFT), the mechanisms by which conscious contents are generated, and the role of consciousness in voluntary action selection.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/26.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Over many years, Professor Morsella has used a combined theoretical and experimental approach to systematically reveal the ‚Äúpassive yet necessary‚Äù role of consciousness in the selection of voluntary skeletomotor actions. Presented as a target article in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, his formulation and synthesis of PFT offers a new integrative framework for clarifying the functional boundaries and implementation mechanisms of consciousness. Meanwhile, public- and campus-facing research communications from his team have showcased evidence that complex ideas can enter consciousness involuntarily, further supporting the view that conscious contents can be generated automatically.</p>

     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>In 1983, Professor Barr√©-Sinoussi first isolated HIV from the lymph nodes of patients with AIDS, laying the groundwork for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Her research not only advanced early detection methods for HIV but also provided a scientific basis for the development of antiretroviral therapies. Beyond her laboratory work, Professor Barr√©-Sinoussi has been deeply engaged in global HIV&#x2F;AIDS prevention and control, with a particular focus on fostering research collaboration and capacity building in resource-limited settings. She has served as president of the International AIDS Society (IAS) and has held key roles on multiple international scientific committees.</p>
