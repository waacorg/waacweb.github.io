<p>The World Conference on Artificial Consciousness has been successfully held for two sessions, with over 10,000 online participants each time, generating significant international influence. From December 26–28, 2025, the 3rd World Conference on Artificial Consciousness (WCAC 2025) will be grandly held at the Northwestern Polytechnical University Taicang Campus (Suzhou, Jiangsu). This marks the first offline gathering of the conference, bringing together top experts and scholars in the global field of artificial consciousness to jointly open a new chapter in artificial consciousness research.</p>
<p>The conference is themed <strong>“Exploration of Fundamental Theories and Practical Applications of Artificial Consciousness.”</strong> Standing on the high ground of theory and traversing the frontiers of research, it will comprehensively present the deep integration of artificial consciousness and artificial intelligence.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Core Discussion:</strong><br>The conference will systematically explore the core definition, interdisciplinary theoretical origins, and fundamental principles of artificial consciousness. It will also discuss current mainstream consciousness theories (such as Integrated Information Theory, Global Neuronal Workspace Theory, Higher-Order Theories of Consciousness, Quantum Consciousness Theory, etc.), deeply analyzing the essential connections and distinctions between artificial consciousness and human consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Interaction:</strong><br>The conference focuses on the interaction between artificial consciousness and artificial intelligence, exploring theoretical breakthroughs and application practices of new brain-like intelligence models, including the DIKWP (Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom, Purpose) cognitive framework, as well as the latest progress in embodied intelligence and brain-computer interfaces.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ethics and Governance:</strong><br>With the rapid development of large models and generative AI technologies, “consciousness-like” phenomena (such as model bias, hallucinations, etc.) have triggered widespread concern. The conference will focus on strategies to eliminate bias and hallucinations, value alignment methods, and ethical governance frameworks. Meanwhile, it will discuss the construction of evaluation systems for large language models and other AI systems, from white-box analysis to black-box verification, ensuring the reliability and safety of artificial consciousness systems.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Future Outlook:</strong><br>It is worth emphasizing that artificial consciousness is regarded as the “brain” of artificial intelligence and is a necessary path to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This conference pays special attention to the future outlook of the synergistic development of Artificial Consciousness and AGI, exploring the construction of virtual consciousness in the Metaverse, human-machine symbiosis and co-evolution models, and frontier issues such as AI ethics and human cognitive enhancement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through multidisciplinary dialogue, the conference aims to examine technological progress from a strategic height, promote the deep integration of artificial consciousness research with fields such as education, healthcare, and manufacturing, and facilitate the formation of an innovation ecosystem with a global vision.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Latest Progress and International Response</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>During the preparation period, the conference has received widespread attention and support from the international academic and industrial communities. In July 2025, the Annual Meeting of the World Artificial Consciousness Association and the Preparatory Meeting for the 3rd Conference were successfully held in Haikou in a hybrid online and offline format. The annual meeting focused on core themes such as “Proactive Health,” “Artificial Consciousness Standards,” and “Global Ethical Governance,” attracting representatives from numerous international organizations and institutions, including the World Health Organization, UN-related agencies, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, the Nobel Institute of Life Sciences, the Silicon Valley China-US Cooperation Promotion Association, the Europe Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and the Sino-European Scientists Forum.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Dignitary Addresses:</strong><br>Current and former Ministers of Health and Education from various countries, as well as academicians from Academies of Engineering and Sciences and leading experts in the AI field, attended online and offline. They delivered speeches at the preparatory opening ceremony, congratulating the conference on its success and elucidating the strategic significance of technological integration from perspectives such as the fusion of supercomputing and AI, and proactive health and artificial consciousness innovation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>International Support:</strong><br>Multiple Nobel Laureates, Turing Award winners, Fields Medalists, and internationally renowned scholars from over twenty countries and regions also conveyed their congratulations and support intentions through written or video messages, expressing their willingness to cooperate with the conference on frontier topics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The international academic community consistently believes that research on artificial consciousness is gathering wisdom from multiple disciplines and requires global collaboration to address challenges. The conference preparatory group has integrated these positive signals into the preparatory work, striving to build an open cooperation platform to promote deep exchange among experts from different countries and fields.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conference Organization and Leadership</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The 3rd World Conference on Artificial Consciousness is jointly hosted by the World Artificial Consciousness Association (WACA) and the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC), with co-organization and support from Northwestern Polytechnical University and other units.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organizational Structure:</strong><br>To prepare for the conference, the hosting and undertaking units have established an Organizing Committee and an Academic Committee, inviting renowned domestic and foreign experts and scholars to serve as members.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Leadership:</strong><br>The Organizing Committee has one Chair (Conference Chair), led by Professor Binxiang Jiang and others, responsible for the overall planning and preparation of the meeting.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Professional Committees:</strong><br>The Organizing Committee has established multiple professional committees (such as the Computational Psychology and Cognitive Science Committee, the Proactive Health Committee, the AI Standardization and Evaluation Committee, etc.), responsible for topic setting and paper review in their respective sub-fields. Each committee is chaired by top scholars in the relevant fields to ensure the scientific nature and foresight of the topics.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Secretariat:</strong><br>The Conference Secretariat is located at the Northwestern Polytechnical University Taicang Campus, responsible for daily conference organization, information release, and international exchange coordination.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the collaborative operation of multiple institutions and disciplines, this conference will be fully guaranteed under standardized management and open exchange.</p>
