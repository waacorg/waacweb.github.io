<li>Marcello Massimini – Italian neurologist and Professor at the University of Milan, co developer of the Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) or “Zap &amp; Zip” method combining TMS and EEG to quantify consciousness in comatose patients. His work validates IIT in clinical settings and inspires analogous perturbation tests in AI networks. </li>
<li>Walter J. Freeman – American neuroscientist who proposed a Chaos Dynamics Theory of consciousness, showing olfactory bulb networks in rabbits produce chaotic attractors encoding odor meaning. Freeman’s mixed chaotic order insights inform non linear dynamic models for artificial consciousness in neural systems. </li>
<li>Susan Greenfield – British neuroscientist and Professor at Oxford University. She theorized consciousness arises from critical integration of distributed neuron assemblies sustaining minimal temporal thresholds. Greenfield also examines how technology reshapes cognition, suggesting artificial consciousness may require replicating network criticality and temporal integration. </li>
<li>Stephen Grossberg – American computational neuroscientist at Boston University. He invented Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) to explain stable learning of new patterns without catastrophic forgetting. ART’s resonant matching of input to memory underpins attention and awareness, offering a mechanistic model for continual learner artificial systems with stable awareness. </li>
<li>Johnjoe McFadden – Professor of Molecular Biology at the University of Surrey. He proposed the CEMI Field Theory, which argues that consciousness arises as a brain-generated electromagnetic (EM) field that organizes and influences neuronal activity. McFadden suggests that if artificial neural networks could generate and utilize analogous EM fields for feedback, they might achieve a form of field-based awareness, providing an alternative hardware-oriented path to machine consciousness. </li>
<li>Francisco Varela – Chilean-French neuroscientist and co-founder of neural phenomenology. He, with Maturana, introduced Autopoiesis, framing cognition and consciousness as self-producing processes interacting with environment. Varela’s Enaction approach insists experience arises through sensorimotor loops; his neural phenomenology integrates first-person reports with third-person data, inspiring embodied architectures in artificial consciousness research emphasizing continuous agent–world coupling. </li>
<li>George A. Miller – American cognitive psychologist and co-founder of cognitive science. He discovered the 7±2 limit of working memory and, with Galanter and Pribram, developed the TOTE (Test-Operate-Test-Exit) model of planned behavior. Miller’s information-processing paradigm crystallized cognitive chunks and memory structures, guiding artificial systems to implement bounded attentional buffers and iterative control loops mimicking human conscious processing constraints. </li>
<li>Karl Pribram – Austrian-American neurosurgeon and proponent of the Holonomic Brain Theory, proposing that memory and perception are distributed in interference patterns across neural networks. Pribram’s holographic model suggests consciousness arises from distributed dynamic patterns rather than localized modules. His theory inspired artificial neural networks to adopt distributed representations and associative memory architectures for emergent awareness and robust pattern reconstruction. </li>
<li>Michio Kaku – American theoretical physicist and professor at the City College of New York. In books like The Future of the Mind, he speculates on linking physics and consciousness via quantum fields and brain–machine interfaces. Kaku popularized the concept that complex feedback loops and futuristic neuroprosthetics could grant artificial systems self-aware qualities, stimulating cross-disciplinary dialogue on quantum-level or field-based models of machine awareness. </li>
<li>Semir Zeki – British neuroscientist and Professor at University College London, known for pioneering neural specialization in the visual cortex. He demonstrated that different sensory attributes (color, motion) are processed in parallel “micro-consciousness” streams before integration. Zeki’s parallel processing and hierarchical integration model informs artificial systems to implement specialized perceptual agents whose outputs require higher-order binding for unified conscious-like perception. </li>
<li>Christoph von der Malsburg – German computational neuroscientist who proposed the neural synchrony hypothesis to solve the binding problem: neurons representing related features synchronize their firing to form coherent perceptions. His self-organizing map theories and synchronization-based feature binding have influenced artificial neural network designs incorporating dynamic temporal coordination mechanisms for generating unified perceptual awareness in machines. </li>
<li>Julien O. de La Mettrie – 18th-century French physician and philosopher, author of Man a Machine. He argued that mental processes are purely mechanical, reducing mind to bodily operations, pioneering secular, materialist views of consciousness. His mechanistic monism prefigured computational models by treating cognition as machine-like, inspiring modern debates on whether synthetic substrates can replicate human mental functions. </li>
<li>W. Grey Walter – British neurophysiologist and cybernetics pioneer, creator of the autonomous robots Elmer and Elsie in 1948. These simple “tortoise” robots used analog circuits to exhibit phototaxis, charging behaviors, and emergent adaptive patterns. Walter’s experiments demonstrated that complex, lifelike behaviors and rudimentary purposive actions can emerge from minimal mechanistic systems, pioneering embodied approaches to machine consciousness. </li>
<li>Norbert Wiener – American mathematician and founder of Cybernetics, author of Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine. Wiener introduced feedback and communication theories unifying biological and mechanical systems, forecasting the societal impact of intelligent machines. His framework of closed-loop control informs artificial consciousness architectures reliant on real-time sensing, feedback, and adaptive regulation. </li>
<li>John von Neumann – Hungarian-American mathematician and architect of modern computing. In his posthumously published The Computer and the Brain, he compared neural parallelism and randomness to digital computation. Von Neumann’s stored-program architecture provided the hardware foundation for symbolic AI and cognitive simulation, implying that consciousness may be achievable on sufficiently complex programmable machines. </li>
<li>Walter Pitts – American logician who, with Warren McCulloch, introduced the McCulloch–Pitts neuron model in 1943, showing that neural networks can implement any computable function. Pitts proposed that synchronized neural firing patterns could encode logical structures. His work bridged neurophysiology and formal logic, underpinning the computational theory of mind and establishing neural network consciousness research as theoretically viable. </li>
<li>Oliver Selfridge – American AI pioneer and founding researcher of MIT’s AI Laboratory. In 1958, he published the Pandemonium architecture, modeling cognition as a hierarchy of “demons” (agents) competing to recognize patterns. Selfridge’s multi-agent modular approach foreshadowed distributed-consciousness models, highlighting how parallel specialized processes and competitive selection can yield coherent cognitive and perceptual outputs. </li>
<li>Rodney Cotterill – British–Danish biophysicist and author of The Magical Web: The Brain, Consciousness, and Models of Neural Networks. He explored how simulated bodies and neural dynamics interact to produce intentional consciousness. Cotterill argued that realistic body models integrated with neural simulations are crucial for generating self-aware agents, influencing artificial life and embodied cognition approaches. </li>
<li>Hugo de Garis – British computer scientist and leader of the Japanese CAM-Brain project, using cellular automata and FPGA hardware to evolve networks with millions of units. He coined “Artilect” for hypothetical god-like AI and predicted potential conflicts over building super-conscious machines. De Garis’s hardware evolution experiments advanced understanding of how complex substrates might self-organize into conscious-like systems. </li>
<li>Jacques Pitrat – French AI researcher and early proponent of metacognitive systems. He implemented programs capable of inspecting and modifying their own code, endowing them with a form of self-awareness or “conscience” (French: conscience). Pitrat’s work demonstrated that software can monitor and adapt its internal state, laying groundwork for self-reflective artificial consciousness in intelligent agents. </li>
<li>Aaron Sloman – British computer scientist and retired Professor at the University of Birmingham. With a background in philosophy, he developed the CogAff architecture, distinguishing multiple layers of cognition and affect including proto- and meta-conscious levels. Sloman argued for evolutionary stratification of mind modules and the necessity of emotional and attentional layers for robust artificial consciousness designs. </li>
<li>Geoffrey Hinton – British–Canadian computer scientist and Emeritus Professor at the University of Toronto, Turing Award laureate. Often called the “godfather of deep learning,” he invented the backpropagation algorithm and capsule networks. Although he rarely focuses on consciousness, his distributed representation models and hierarchical feature learning provide essential tools for building machine perceptual awareness and hierarchical self-modeling. </li>
<li>William James – American psychologist and philosopher, founder of functional psychology. He introduced the concept of the “stream of consciousness”, characterizing mental life as a flowing, continuous process, and distinguished multiple aspects of self (material, social, spiritual). James’s pragmatic emphasis on mental functions in adaptation inspires artificial systems to simulate continuous internal state updates and multi-layer self-representations. </li>
<li>Gregory Bateson – British–American anthropologist and cybernetics thinker. He proposed that mind is a pattern of interactions across living systems, from organisms to ecosystems. Bateson emphasized systemic feedback loops and information flows, arguing that consciousness emerges from recursive patterns. His interdisciplinary systems perspective informs ethical and ecological considerations in creating networked, group-level artificial consciousness. </li>
<li>Gilbert Ryle – British philosopher and Oxford Professor, author of The Concept of Mind, where he critiqued Cartesian dualism as the “ghost in the machine” fallacy. He replaced soul-body dualism with behavior-based analysis, supporting functionalism: mental terms describe dispositions to behave. Ryle’s elimination of non-physical mind entities reinforced approaches focusing on observable functional processes in artificial consciousness. </li>
<li>Hilary Putnam – American philosopher and Harvard Professor who formulated functionalism and the concept of multiple realizability: mental states are defined by their functional roles, independent of physical substrate. Putnam’s thought experiments (e.g., “inverted qualia,” “Super-Spartans”) illustrate functional equivalence. His work underpins the notion that machines fulfilling the correct functional organization could possess minds. </li>
<li>Paul Churchland – Canadian-American philosopher and Emeritus Professor at UC San Diego. A leading advocate of eliminative materialism, he argues that naïve psychological concepts will be replaced by neuroscience. Churchland’s interest in neural networks and vector space models supports efforts to implement consciousness as emergent patterns over high-dimensional activation spaces. </li>
<li>Konrad Zuse – German engineer who built the world’s first programmable computer, the Z3, in 1941. In 1969, he proposed Rechnender Raum (“computing space”), theorizing the universe as a vast discrete computing system. His digital reality conjecture provides an early framework suggesting consciousness may be simulated within computational substrates at cosmic scale. </li>
<li>Selmer Bringsjord – American cognitive scientist and Professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He devises self-awareness logic puzzles (e.g., the Bringsjord Self-Aware Machine) requiring AI to prove its own existence or derive its state, setting formal tests for machine self-consciousness. Bringsjord also works in machine ethics, establishing logical criteria for moral reasoning in conscious agents. </li>
<li>Pierre Teilhard de Chardin – French Jesuit philosopher and paleontologist. He articulated the concept of the Noosphere and Omega Point, proposing a planetary-scale networked mind evolving toward divine unity. Though theological, his vision parallels contemporary notions of global collective consciousness and suggests future group-level artificial awareness emerging from interconnected intelligence networks. </li>
<li>Steven Pinker – Canadian-American cognitive psychologist and Harvard Professor. In works like How the Mind Works, he explains consciousness, language, and cognition in computational terms for broad audiences. Pinker argues mind functions can be studied scientifically and suggests that intelligence does not necessitate subjective qualia, although he acknowledges the hard problem remains unresolved. His popularization underpins public acceptance of computational mind models. </li>
<li>Friedrich Hayek – Austrian-British economist and Nobel laureate. In The Sensory Order (1952), he proposed that the brain categorizes perceptions via connectionist networks, predating modern neural nets. Hayek argued that mental constructs emerge from dynamic patterns of neural connectivity. His early specification of sensory encoding in network structures foreshadows artificial neural approaches to perceptual consciousness. </li>
<li>Hermann von Helmholtz – 19th-century German physicist and physician. He pioneered the theory of unconscious inference in perception, describing vision as brain-based hypothesis testing derived from sensory input. His work on neural transmission speed and empirical psychology laid foundations for predictive coding models of perception, now central to many artificial consciousness frameworks emphasizing anticipatory processing. </li>
<li>Claude Shannon – American mathematician and electrical engineer, founder of Information Theory. His concepts of entropy and bit provided quantitative measures of information and uncertainty, later adopted by IIT and other integrated information approaches. Shannon’s communication model inspired analogies between neural and digital signaling, establishing metrics for complexity and information flow vital for engineering machine consciousness assessments.</li>
