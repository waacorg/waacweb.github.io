<p>We are pleased to announce that Adam Zeman—Professor of Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology at the University of Exeter Medical School and co-lead of The Eye’s Mind project on extreme imagery—has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC), in recognition of his foundational contributions to “aphantasia” and mental imagery, as well as to research on consciousness and autobiographical memory&#x2F;transient epileptic amnesia (TEA).</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/7.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>In a 2015 paper in Cortex, Professor Zeman formally introduced the concept of aphantasia, catalyzing systematic research on the imagery continuum (including hyperphantasia) and its neural mechanisms. His team’s series of studies on the triad of transient epileptic amnesia (TEA), autobiographical memory impairment, and accelerated long-term forgetting (ALF) has provided pivotal evidence for both clinical practice and theoretical work on consciousness and memory.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Andrew Adamatzky—Professor in the Faculty of Computer Science and Creative Technologies at UWE Bristol and Director of the Unconventional Computing Laboratory—has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC), in recognition of his pioneering work in unconventional computing, slime mould&#x2F;fungal computing, and reaction–diffusion computing, as well as his sustained exploration of and insightful contributions to the search for computational markers of consciousness.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/8.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Adamatzky has long led UWE Bristol’s unconventional computing team, focusing on the computational principles, architectures, and prototype implementations of “non-silicon” substrates such as chemical media, slime moulds, plants, and fungi. In recent years, he has opened a new line of inquiry into fungal computing and fungal machines, revealing the electrical activity and information-processing potential of fungal mycelial networks and proposing a systematic framework for “Fungal Machines.” This body of work offers fresh clues toward comparable consciousness indicators and interpretable computational mechanisms in natural systems, and provides methodological inspiration for verifiable evaluation in neuromorphic intelligence and brain–computer interfaces.</p>

 &emsp;&emsp;Academician Qinxi Dong, as a special guest, attended the WACA Annual Conference and the Preparatory Meeting for the 3rd World Artificial Consciousness Congress online. He congratulated the successful convening of the conference and paid tribute to colleagues dedicated to the cause of artificial consciousness. He emphasized that computing technology is crucial to the development of artificial consciousness—supercomputing supports AI large models and brain-like simulations, while the integration of AI and high-performance computing is driving a shift in proactive medicine from passive treatment to active prevention, thus facilitating the advancement of personalized healthcare. He also called for deeper interdisciplinary collaboration across computational science, life medicine, and other fields to inspire innovation and achieve technological breakthroughs. He expressed high expectations for the integration of artificial consciousness and proactive medicine.

</div>
 &emsp;&emsp;Academician Zhen Liu, in his speech, welcomed participants from all sectors to gather and explore the profound theme of "The Future of Artificial Consciousness." He noted that artificial intelligence has already transformed the way we work and that its pace of evolution has exceeded expectations. We now stand at the forefront of a new technological revolution, delving into the challenge of endowing machines with higher-level self-awareness and emotional integration—a pursuit that goes beyond technological advancement to encompass philosophical, ethical, and social dimensions. He stressed the need to reflect on the implications of artificial consciousness for human society, its differences from human self-awareness, and how to ensure its safety, ethics, and progress. He described this as a global, interdisciplinary issue with far-reaching social significance.

</div>
 &emsp;&emsp;At the annual meeting, Academician Hengjin Cai, Vice President of the World Artificial Consciousness Association, summarized the work of the past year and outlined prospects for the future. He stated that, in terms of theoretical exploration, a consensus has been established that consciousness and intelligence share a common origin. At its core, this theory posits that consciousness stems from a form of cognitive inertia evolved by living beings to escape the constraints of physical time and space. Intelligence is defined as the ability to reconstruct causal chains, while consciousness is the experience of a non-local internal world. This framework, he emphasized, serves as a theoretical cornerstone for understanding artificial consciousness. In applied practice, proactive medicine and artificial consciousness have become deeply integrated. Digital twin technology is now being applied in health management, enabling the simulation of individual physiological, psychological, and cognitive patterns to predict disease risks and deliver personalized interventions—thus returning to a human-centered medical philosophy. Regarding preparations for the Third World Artificial Consciousness Congress, he proposed focusing on the themes of symbiosis and standardization. He advocated for a new paradigm of human-machine integration in which human values become embedded within AI itself. At the same time, he stressed that the standardization committee must develop a forward-looking and inclusive ethical framework. He concluded by underscoring that artificial consciousness is a civilizational issue and called for global collaboration to build a safe, trustworthy, and coexistent intelligent future.

</div>
 &emsp;&emsp;Academician Aikebai’er Yilahon, in his address, remarked that the 21st century is the era of biotechnology and electronic information technology. He noted that electronic information has now advanced to the stage of artificial consciousness (AC) development, achieving a high level in just over two decades. AC has had a significant impact on humanity, especially in its integration with biotechnology and medicine, where it plays a highly effective role.

 &emsp;&emsp;Professor Erxiang Dou, in his speech, proposed that artificial consciousness is driving a new paradigm in human civilization, which requires the construction of an appropriate foundation for economic and social governance. He introduced his theory of “Tri-Fairism” (TRIF)—an approach developed through research in digital economic finance, positioned between government and market forces, and aiming for fairness, justice, and the dual objectives of extracting wealth and generating well-being. TRIF is deeply integrated with the DIKWP cognitive model and is designed to address the core issues of releasing creativity and anchoring human welfare during the development of machine consciousness. He emphasized that during the cognitive leaps enabled by the DIKWP model, the TRIF framework should be used to tackle crises of economic fairness (such as preventing algorithmic hegemony) and challenges to consciousness sovereignty (such as constraining the capitalization of neural data). He called on the preparatory committee to promote the development of DIKWP-TRIF tools—capable of quantifying the technical, institutional, and financial attributes of related projects—and to initiate the drafting of global governance principles for the consciousness economy, including defining property rights over neural data. He concluded with well wishes for the success of the annual meeting and the upcoming Third World Artificial Consciousness Congress.

 &emsp;&emsp;Prof. Chunhui Wang delivered a speech titled “From Large Models to World Models.” He pointed out that since the release of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, generative AI has branched into two main areas: large language models (LLMs) and world models. LLMs rely on one-dimensional representation based on text sequences, while multimodal models still suffer from issues such as "hallucinations." In contrast, world models are built upon understanding the laws of the physical world, moving toward three-dimensional digital spaces. Their essence lies in predicting changes in the physical world, which is foundational for the development of embodied intelligence. He argued that achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) hinges on enabling intelligence to comprehend physical laws. AI agents must align with human values and operate within authorized boundaries. He recommended that the Artificial Consciousness Association conduct research into areas such as the neural mechanisms of consciousness, affective computing, AGI, and the integration of ethics and philosophy to ensure that AI development remains aligned with human interests.
