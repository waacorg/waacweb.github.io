     style="width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that Arnaud Delorme—research lead at CerCo&#x2F;UMR 5549, CNRS–Université Paul Sabatier (Toulouse III), and Senior Research Scientist at the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) &#x2F; Institute for Neural Computation (INC), UC San Diego—has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC), in recognition of his programmatic contributions to EEG and meditation, consciousness-related oscillations, and closed-loop neurofeedback.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/12.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Delorme has long leveraged high-dimensional EEG and independent component analysis (ICA) to parse the dynamics of conscious states, establishing cross-laboratory, reproducible paradigms for the neural phenotypes of meditation and mind-wandering. His signature contribution is the open-source platform EEGLAB: together with Scott Makeig, his 2004 paper in the Journal of Neuroscience Methods set community standards for single-trial EEG dynamics and ICA, now widely used in neuroscience and clinical research. For general audiences, he authored Why Our Minds Wander, synthesizing the science of mind-wandering; the trajectory and methodological implications of his work have been widely covered by institutions and media including UCSF and UC San Diego.</p>

     style="width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">     </p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that Angela D. Friederici—Director and Founding Director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (MPI CBS), Germany—has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC), in recognition of her foundational research on the neural bases of language processing and her cross-disciplinary impact.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/13.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Friederici has long led the Department of Neuropsychology at MPI CBS, integrating behavioral methods, ERP&#x2F;MEG, and fMRI&#x2F;structural connectivity to systematically chart the human language network and its developmental trajectory. Drawing on extensive reviews and empirical studies, she has proposed that the language network comprises at least two dorsal and two ventral pathways: the dorsal pathways subserve auditory–motor mapping and complex syntax, while the ventral pathways support semantic processing and basic syntax—a framework that has become a core model in neurolinguistics. Developmental research further shows that the ventral pathways are present at birth and mature earlier, whereas the dorsal pathway to the inferior frontal gyrus, associated with complex syntax, matures later—providing a biological basis for language acquisition and informing educational interventions.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Li-Huei Tsai, Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT and Director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) in recognition of her pioneering contributions to the mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease and to 40 Hz gamma-rhythm sensory entrainment (GENUS).</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/3.png" 
     style="width:40%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Drawing from neural-circuit and molecular perspectives, Prof. Tsai has elucidated how CDK5&#x2F;p25 dysregulation, epigenetic regulation, and neuroinflammation shape memory and neurodegeneration, and she has advanced the strategy of modulating network rhythms through 40 Hz multisensory stimulation to improve cognition. Her work has had broad impact across neuroscience, brain–computer interfaces, and neuromorphic intelligence, offering new, testable avenues for computational mechanisms and evaluation frameworks relevant to machine consciousness.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Lucia Regolin, Professor in the Department of General Psychology at the University of Padua and head of the Comparative Cognition Lab, has been elected as an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) in recognition of her systematic contributions to animal consciousness and innate representations—particularly the number–space mapping and social&#x2F;perceptual mechanisms elucidated using domestic chick models.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/4.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Regolin is a tenured professor in the Department of General Psychology at the University of Padua, whose research has long focused on the origins of mind and comparative cognition. Regolin’s team and collaborators were the first to demonstrate in newly hatched chicks a human-like “mental number line”—with smaller numbers mapped to the left and larger numbers to the right—providing key evidence for an innate component of the number–space association (Science, 2015). Subsequent work further showed that this linkage is explained primarily by numerical magnitude rather than by individual spatial biases. These findings offer reproducible experimental paradigms for understanding nonverbal quantity representation and “consciousness-like” information selection.</p>

     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Van Swinderen’s team has long employed Drosophila as a model system, using quantifiable behavioral and neural phenotypes to build a cross-species, comparable framework of consciousness indicators and mechanisms. Representative contributions include establishing “attention–sleep–anesthesia” as three measurable endpoints for consciousness research; identifying a paradoxical&#x2F;active sleep-like state in flies; demonstrating a direct coupling between sleep and selective attention; and linking computational consciousness metrics to fruit-fly anesthesia. These advances not only promote a unified understanding of arousal, attention, and sleep in neuroscience, but also lay the groundwork for cross-species, verifiable consciousness assessment systems and anesthetic targets, influencing methodological practice across fields such as brain–computer interfaces and neuromorphic intelligence.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Barbara Tversky—Professor of Psychology and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University, and Professor Emerita of Psychology at Stanford University—has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC), in recognition of her foundational contributions to spatial cognition, visual&#x2F;gestural representation, and diagrammatic communication, as well as her sustained influence on cross-disciplinary methods in cognitive science.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/6.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Barbara Tversky places spatial thinking at the foundation of cognition: in her monograph Mind in Motion: How Action Shapes Thought, she systematically argues for a pathway from action and space to thought, emphasizing that spatial cognition is not peripheral but the bedrock of higher cognition. She and her collaborators further show that diagrams and gestures are powerful “tools for thought,” externalizing and reorganizing mental representations through charts, sketches, and gesture to markedly facilitate explanation and reasoning. These contributions have advanced an integrated understanding linking space&#x2F;action, language, and reasoning; provided robust evidence for methodologies in education, design, human–computer interaction, and visualization; and inspired new approaches to representing and assessing artificial consciousness.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Adam Zeman—Professor of Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology at the University of Exeter Medical School and co-lead of The Eye’s Mind project on extreme imagery—has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC), in recognition of his foundational contributions to “aphantasia” and mental imagery, as well as to research on consciousness and autobiographical memory&#x2F;transient epileptic amnesia (TEA).</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/7.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>In a 2015 paper in Cortex, Professor Zeman formally introduced the concept of aphantasia, catalyzing systematic research on the imagery continuum (including hyperphantasia) and its neural mechanisms. His team’s series of studies on the triad of transient epileptic amnesia (TEA), autobiographical memory impairment, and accelerated long-term forgetting (ALF) has provided pivotal evidence for both clinical practice and theoretical work on consciousness and memory.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Andrew Adamatzky—Professor in the Faculty of Computer Science and Creative Technologies at UWE Bristol and Director of the Unconventional Computing Laboratory—has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC), in recognition of his pioneering work in unconventional computing, slime mould&#x2F;fungal computing, and reaction–diffusion computing, as well as his sustained exploration of and insightful contributions to the search for computational markers of consciousness.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/8.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Adamatzky has long led UWE Bristol’s unconventional computing team, focusing on the computational principles, architectures, and prototype implementations of “non-silicon” substrates such as chemical media, slime moulds, plants, and fungi. In recent years, he has opened a new line of inquiry into fungal computing and fungal machines, revealing the electrical activity and information-processing potential of fungal mycelial networks and proposing a systematic framework for “Fungal Machines.” This body of work offers fresh clues toward comparable consciousness indicators and interpretable computational mechanisms in natural systems, and provides methodological inspiration for verifiable evaluation in neuromorphic intelligence and brain–computer interfaces.</p>

 &emsp;&emsp;At the annual meeting, Academician Hengjin Cai, Vice President of the World Artificial Consciousness Association, summarized the work of the past year and outlined prospects for the future. He stated that, in terms of theoretical exploration, a consensus has been established that consciousness and intelligence share a common origin. At its core, this theory posits that consciousness stems from a form of cognitive inertia evolved by living beings to escape the constraints of physical time and space. Intelligence is defined as the ability to reconstruct causal chains, while consciousness is the experience of a non-local internal world. This framework, he emphasized, serves as a theoretical cornerstone for understanding artificial consciousness. In applied practice, proactive medicine and artificial consciousness have become deeply integrated. Digital twin technology is now being applied in health management, enabling the simulation of individual physiological, psychological, and cognitive patterns to predict disease risks and deliver personalized interventions—thus returning to a human-centered medical philosophy. Regarding preparations for the Third World Artificial Consciousness Congress, he proposed focusing on the themes of symbiosis and standardization. He advocated for a new paradigm of human-machine integration in which human values become embedded within AI itself. At the same time, he stressed that the standardization committee must develop a forward-looking and inclusive ethical framework. He concluded by underscoring that artificial consciousness is a civilizational issue and called for global collaboration to build a safe, trustworthy, and coexistent intelligent future.

 &emsp;&emsp;Academician Dongfang Wu, during the annual meeting, paid tribute to pioneers in the global field of artificial consciousness. As a scholar deeply engaged in distributed governance networking technologies, he pointed out that the computing power revolution is the cornerstone of artificial consciousness development. Breakthroughs in supercomputing technology are pushing the boundaries of biological intelligence, enabling a leap from content generation to the emergence of consciousness in machines. In proactive medicine, this shift supports a paradigm change toward predicting disease before it occurs. He noted that one of the current core challenges is designing scientifically measurable and verifiable metrics for consciousness. He recommended building a DIKWP standard system and emphasized the need for hardware-software collaboration in supercomputing to overcome existing bottlenecks. He expressed hopes that the third congress will promote synergy across the technology chain (integrating high-performance computing, neuroscience, etc.) and interdisciplinary innovation in real-world applications (such as health management in proactive medicine). He also called for the establishment of a cross-civilizational ethical consensus to ensure technological development aligns with human values. He concluded by stressing that researchers are not only explorers of technology but also guardians of human values, and urged for breaking down disciplinary barriers.

 &emsp;&emsp;Professor Erxiang Dou, in his speech, proposed that artificial consciousness is driving a new paradigm in human civilization, which requires the construction of an appropriate foundation for economic and social governance. He introduced his theory of “Tri-Fairism” (TRIF)—an approach developed through research in digital economic finance, positioned between government and market forces, and aiming for fairness, justice, and the dual objectives of extracting wealth and generating well-being. TRIF is deeply integrated with the DIKWP cognitive model and is designed to address the core issues of releasing creativity and anchoring human welfare during the development of machine consciousness. He emphasized that during the cognitive leaps enabled by the DIKWP model, the TRIF framework should be used to tackle crises of economic fairness (such as preventing algorithmic hegemony) and challenges to consciousness sovereignty (such as constraining the capitalization of neural data). He called on the preparatory committee to promote the development of DIKWP-TRIF tools—capable of quantifying the technical, institutional, and financial attributes of related projects—and to initiate the drafting of global governance principles for the consciousness economy, including defining property rights over neural data. He concluded with well wishes for the success of the annual meeting and the upcoming Third World Artificial Consciousness Congress.

 &emsp;&emsp;Prof. Chunhui Wang delivered a speech titled “From Large Models to World Models.” He pointed out that since the release of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, generative AI has branched into two main areas: large language models (LLMs) and world models. LLMs rely on one-dimensional representation based on text sequences, while multimodal models still suffer from issues such as "hallucinations." In contrast, world models are built upon understanding the laws of the physical world, moving toward three-dimensional digital spaces. Their essence lies in predicting changes in the physical world, which is foundational for the development of embodied intelligence. He argued that achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) hinges on enabling intelligence to comprehend physical laws. AI agents must align with human values and operate within authorized boundaries. He recommended that the Artificial Consciousness Association conduct research into areas such as the neural mechanisms of consciousness, affective computing, AGI, and the integration of ethics and philosophy to ensure that AI development remains aligned with human interests.
