     style="width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">     </p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Yixin Zhong, Professor at the Center for Intelligent Science and Technology at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) and former Vice President of BUPT—who has also served as the inaugural Chief Expert for the Communications theme under China’s National High-Tech R&amp;D Program (Program 863) and as former President of the Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence (CAAI)—has been elected a Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) in recognition of his pioneering contributions to foundational information science and methodologies for general artificial intelligence.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/71.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Zhong has long focused on foundational research in information science and artificial intelligence, emphasizing that “truly useful information” should be understood as an integrated triad—syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic information—and advancing the systematic development of comprehensive information and semantic information theory. Centered on the “information–knowledge–intelligence transformation,” he has articulated a mechanistic research program, arguing that a shared core mechanism of intelligence generation can be framed as information conversion, and using this framework to discuss how mainstream approaches can be unified and made complementary.</p>

     style="width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">     </p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Shuo-Yen Robert Li, Director of the Li Institute of Mathematical Technology and Distinguished University Professor at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Emeritus Professor in the Department of Information Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Academician of the National Academy for Artificial Intelligence (NAAI), and IEEE Life Fellow, has been elected Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) in recognition of his outstanding impact on the fundamental theories of information and intelligence.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/70.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Li is a founding figure of Network Coding Theory. Together with his collaborators, he introduced the linear network coding framework, in which data packets are algebraically mixed at network nodes, thereby breaking through the traditional store-and-forward routing paradigm and dramatically improving transmission efficiency in multicast and other complex network scenarios. In the broader landscape of information science, he has systematically developed Algebraic Switching Theory, elevating switching network problems to a unified framework of abstract algebraic structures. His work on martingales of patterns, presented in representative publications such as A Martingale Approach to the Study of Occurrence of Sequence Patterns in Repeated Experiments, has been widely cited in textbooks and monographs on stochastic processes. Professor Li’s contributions to network coding and algebraic switching provide key mathematical languages for building highly reliable, high-throughput and interpretable intelligent infrastructures. His probabilistic perspective based on martingales of patterns offers powerful tools for understanding the predictability and explainability of complex behaviours and temporal patterns, laying a solid foundation for WAAC’s research agenda in artificial consciousness and intelligent systems.</p>

<p>The World Conference on Artificial Consciousness has been successfully held for two sessions, with over 10,000 online participants each time, generating significant international influence. From December 26–28, 2025, the 3rd World Conference on Artificial Consciousness (WCAC 2025) will be grandly held at the Northwestern Polytechnical University Taicang Campus (Suzhou, Jiangsu). This marks the first offline gathering of the conference, bringing together top experts and scholars in the global field of artificial consciousness to jointly open a new chapter in artificial consciousness research.</p>
<p>The conference is themed <strong>“Exploration of Fundamental Theories and Practical Applications of Artificial Consciousness.”</strong> Standing on the high ground of theory and traversing the frontiers of research, it will comprehensively present the deep integration of artificial consciousness and artificial intelligence.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Core Discussion:</strong><br>The conference will systematically explore the core definition, interdisciplinary theoretical origins, and fundamental principles of artificial consciousness. It will also discuss current mainstream consciousness theories (such as Integrated Information Theory, Global Neuronal Workspace Theory, Higher-Order Theories of Consciousness, Quantum Consciousness Theory, etc.), deeply analyzing the essential connections and distinctions between artificial consciousness and human consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Interaction:</strong><br>The conference focuses on the interaction between artificial consciousness and artificial intelligence, exploring theoretical breakthroughs and application practices of new brain-like intelligence models, including the DIKWP (Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom, Purpose) cognitive framework, as well as the latest progress in embodied intelligence and brain-computer interfaces.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ethics and Governance:</strong><br>With the rapid development of large models and generative AI technologies, “consciousness-like” phenomena (such as model bias, hallucinations, etc.) have triggered widespread concern. The conference will focus on strategies to eliminate bias and hallucinations, value alignment methods, and ethical governance frameworks. Meanwhile, it will discuss the construction of evaluation systems for large language models and other AI systems, from white-box analysis to black-box verification, ensuring the reliability and safety of artificial consciousness systems.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Future Outlook:</strong><br>It is worth emphasizing that artificial consciousness is regarded as the “brain” of artificial intelligence and is a necessary path to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This conference pays special attention to the future outlook of the synergistic development of Artificial Consciousness and AGI, exploring the construction of virtual consciousness in the Metaverse, human-machine symbiosis and co-evolution models, and frontier issues such as AI ethics and human cognitive enhancement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through multidisciplinary dialogue, the conference aims to examine technological progress from a strategic height, promote the deep integration of artificial consciousness research with fields such as education, healthcare, and manufacturing, and facilitate the formation of an innovation ecosystem with a global vision.</p>

     style="width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">     </p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that Axel Cleeremans, Professor of Cognitive Science at the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB) and Research Director with the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique (F.R.S.–FNRS), has been elected as an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) in recognition of his pioneering contributions to implicit learning and consciousness, reportability, and metacognition.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/69.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Cleeremans has long focused on the differences between conscious and unconscious information processing, and has systematically advanced the Radical Plasticity Thesis (RPT) and the Self-Organizing Metarepresentational Architecture (SOMA). He argues that consciousness is not an intrinsic property of specific neural states, but a function that gradually emerges as the brain continuously learns and re-describes its own activity—thereby linking learning, representational quality, and subjective experience within a unified mechanistic account. Representative papers appeared in Frontiers in Psychology (2011) and Trends in Cognitive Sciences (2020), and a state-of-the-art review published in 2025 further elaborated its implications for consciousness science and AI ethics. In academic leadership and team building, Professor Cleeremans heads ULB’s CO3 (Consciousness, Cognition &amp; Computation) Laboratory and collaborates across the CRCN (Center for Research in Cognition and Neurosciences). He currently leads two ERC Advanced Grants—one (2014–2019) on the mechanisms of consciousness and another (2022–2027) on its functions—which are driving systematic research from theory and methods through to applications.</p>

     style="width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">     </p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Timothy F. Brady, a professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), has been elected as an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) for his pioneering research in the relationship between visual working memory and consciousness.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/68.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Brady has long been dedicated to studying how humans process and store visual information, with a particular focus on the intersection of visual working memory, perception, and consciousness. He has proposed several theories regarding the capacity for visual information processing and has employed various experimental methods to explore how the brain maintains sensitivity to complex visual stimuli under limited cognitive resources. His research has provided new perspectives on understanding memory capacity, attention mechanisms, and the interactions between perception and consciousness, significantly advancing both theoretical and applied research in this field. Building on this foundation, Professor Brady leads the UCSD Visual Working Memory and Consciousness Lab, conducting interdisciplinary research that includes computational models, neuroscience experiments, and applied studies (such as multitasking and the optimization of visual interfaces). This research continues to deepen our understanding of the role and impact of visual working memory in complex environments. His contributions have not only influenced basic scientific research but also provided valuable theoretical support for practical applications, particularly in the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive computing.</p>

<p>The World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) hereby appoints Professor Chunhui Wang as Chief Data Officer (CDO). Professor Wang is an internationally renowned expert in the rule of law for the internet and data, data governance and compliance, and the regulation of generative artificial intelligence. He has extensive scholarly work and practical policy experience in areas including cybersovereignty, the innovative development of data as a factor of production, cross-border data flows, personal information protection, and AI governance.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/chw.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Chunhui Wang currently serves as President of the International Data Association (IDA); Director of the Digital Economy Research Institute at the United Nations World Silk Road Forum; Chief Expert for Decision-Making Consultation at the China Association for Science and Technology (CAST); member of the Expert Committee on the Information and Communications Economy under China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT); and Vice Chair of the World Association for Artificial Consciousness (WACA). He has long been committed to advancing the rule-of-law–based and internationalized development of the data-factor market. He is the first scholar globally to propose that the boundaries of international law in cyberspace sovereignty should be defined by the “right of cyber-territory” and to recommend incorporating this concept into the United Nations Charter. He took the lead in introducing such concepts as “data factor,” “data economy,” and “shared ownership of data,” which have been reviewed and registered by China’s national copyright authority. He argues that the value creation of data resources lies in the unity of use value and (exchange) value, and he advocates promoting the secure governance and innovative development of the data-factor market through the rule of law. In the development and utilization of public data resources, he has put forward regulatory proposals such as a “dynamic fair-competition review” for the public data-factor market, providing important theoretical support for authorized operations of public data and for fair competition. In the field of AI applications, he has argued that prompt engineering is the bridge of communication between humans and AI systems: humans must input carefully designed prompts so that AI can accurately understand human intent and efficiently perform various specific tasks. As Chief Data Officer, Professor Chunhui Wang will be responsible for building a compliant data-asset system and audit framework to support research on artificial consciousness, helping to achieve controllable, verifiable, and responsible development of artificial consciousness systems.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Asada of Osaka University and Osaka University of Information Technology in Japan has been elected as an Academician of WAAC for his outstanding contributions to cognitive developmental robotics, artificial empathy, and artificial consciousness.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/64.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Asada has long been devoted to exploring implementable mechanisms of consciousness and empathy in artificial systems. He has systematically proposed a brain-inspired computational framework centered on pain and touch, advocating the embedding of human-like nociceptive&#x2F;tactile neural systems in robots, combined with mirror-neuron mechanisms, to drive the hierarchical emergence from emotional contagion to empathy to a sense of morality. His representative work, Artificial Pain May Induce Empathy, Morality, and Ethics in the Conscious Mind of Robots (2019), along with related reviews, has had a wide impact in academia and has become an important reference for research on artificial empathy and artificial consciousness.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Nicola S. Clayton—Professor of Comparative Cognition in the Department of Psychology at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS, elected 2010)—has been elected as an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) for her outstanding contributions to corvid cognition, future planning, and signs of consciousness.</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/65.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Using corvids (such as the western scrub-jay) as model species, Professor Clayton has long and systematically revealed episodic-like memory and future-oriented planning in nonhuman animals: her team provided the first behavioral evidence of “what–where–when” memory in Nature (1998), and further showed in Nature (2007) that scrub-jays can prepare for tomorrow, challenging the view that future planning is unique to humans. These studies offer milestone evidence for understanding animal intelligence and indicators of consciousness, and have profoundly influenced the development of comparative cognition.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Professor Nicholas G. Hatsopoulos—Professor in the Department of Organismal Biology &amp; Anatomy at The University of Chicago and a core member of the interdisciplinary programs in Neuroscience and Computational Neuroscience—has been elected as an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) for his outstanding contributions to motor cortex coding, population neurocomputation, and brain–computer interfaces (BCIs).</p>
<p><img src="/images/media/66.png" 
     style="width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"></p>
<p>Professor Hatsopoulos has long been devoted to uncovering how the motor cortex encodes and generates movement. His team proposed and validated the “movement fragments”&#x2F;preferred-trajectory coding view: individual motor-cortex neurons exhibit selectivity for time-evolving movement trajectories rather than merely tuning to instantaneous kinematic parameters, helping drive a paradigm shift from “static tuning” to “temporal trajectory” frameworks. In BCIs and neuroprosthetics, his group has significantly enhanced device stability and usability through closed-loop sensory feedback and population-activity decoding, with multiple University of Chicago news and research reports demonstrating how tactile&#x2F;proprioceptive feedback improves performance and its potential for clinical translation.</p>
