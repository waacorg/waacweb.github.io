Background and significance\"></a>1. Background and significance</h1><p>The development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is gradually moving towards the stage of \"embodied intelligence\", that is, giving agents the ability to interact with the body and the environment. A large number of studies have pointed out that <strong>embodied intelligence is the key way to realize human-like intelligence: agents can only truly acquire human-level cognition and adaptability when they are embedded in the physical world and form a closed loop through perceptual feedback and action response. At present, the practice in the fields of robotics and autonomous agents shows that it is difficult for \"detached intelligence\" that relies only on virtual data training to cope with the complex and changeable real environment, so it is generally believed that embodied intelligence is either the only way to move towards AGI, or should be regarded as part of the definition of AGI.</strong></p>\n<p>However, there are still significant challenges to achieving embodied intelligence. First, the <strong>complexity of the sensory-motor integration mechanism makes it difficult for artificial systems to reproduce the efficient sensing-action coordination of living organisms</strong>. Perception and movement are closely coupled in the biological brain, perception will guide movement in real time, and motion feedback will update perception, forming a dynamic closed loop. However, existing artificial intelligence often separates perception, cognition, and behavior, and it is difficult to achieve the integration efficiency of biological systems. Secondly, <strong>spatial understanding and modeling are still difficult: artificial intelligence lacks</strong> [an intrinsic representation similar to the \"cognitive map\" of the mammalian hippocampus]{.underline}, and it is difficult for AI to automatically construct an understanding of the spatial cognition and physical rules of the environment like living organisms. At present, there are still bottlenecks in the understanding of the physical world of robots, such as poor model generalization, <strong>difficult multimodal fusion, and insufficient real-time performance. For example, it is difficult to align data from different sensors in time and space, the migration of models is hindered due to the difference between the simulated environment and the real environment, and a large amount of data is required to cover environmental changes. These problems severely limit the robustness and versatility of embodied intelligence systems.</strong></p>\n<p>In response to the above challenges, this project takes the DIKWP model (Data-Information-Knowledge-Intelligence-Intent) and its artificial consciousness theory as the core support, and explores a new path for the realization of embodied intelligence. The DIKWP model is an artificial consciousness framework originally created by Professor Duan Yucong's team, which adds the highest layer of \"Purpose\" on the basis of the classic DIKW (pyramid) model. This expansion integrates subjective intention into the objective cognitive process, forming a five-layer cognitive system from data perception to goal-oriented decision-making, which is regarded as an important theoretical innovation in the field of artificial intelligence. The DIKWP framework comprehensively covers the complete chain from raw data acquisition to intelligent decision-making to action intention, enabling us to systematically incorporate motivation and intention into the agent's cognitive process. Compared with the traditional architecture that only focuses on perception and reasoning, the DIKWP model highlights \"intention-driven\" and emphasizes the goals and meanings behind cognitive processes. This makes AI systems not only focus on \"how\" but also \"why\" when performing tasks, so as to move towards autonomous intelligence and class consciousness.</p>\n<p>The DIKWP model and artificial consciousness theory have shown unique advantages and academic contributions in perceptual construction, self-state cognition, and intention-driven behavior. Firstly, the hierarchical structure of DIKWP corresponds to the human cognitive process from low-level perception to high-level cognition to purpose-oriented action, which can be used to construct the perceptual hierarchy of artificial intelligence step by step. For example, using this model, the data collected by sensors can be refined into meaningful information patterns, which can further form environmental knowledge and intelligent decision-making, and finally the intention layer will guide the direction of behavior. This hierarchical perception construction is expected to solve the current problem of multimodal perception fusion, so that AI can gradually accumulate an understanding of the environment. Secondly, the DIKWP framework introduces elements of metacognition and self-model: its \"intelligence\" layer contains the ability of reflection and cognitive self-reflection, while the \"intention\" layer gives the system an internal driving force, which can be regarded as a preliminary expression of self-awareness. Therefore, this model helps AI to recognize its own state, such as understanding the limitations of its own knowledge, and having an overall understanding of its environment and goals, which are the keys to achieving autonomy. Thirdly, the \"intention\" layer of DIKWP allows the agent's behavior selection to be guided by internal goals, which has the characteristics of intention-driven behavior. This is of great significance in areas such as reinforcement learning: by explicitly representing \"intent\" within the agent, it can improve the coherence and purpose of decision-making, and make AI behavior more autonomous and reasonable. Finally, the DIKWP model greatly enhances the interpretability and transparency of AI systems. Because the framework modularizes the internal processing of agents into five layers, developers and evaluators can track each layer of information processing, transforming the previously incomprehensible \"black box\" decision-making process into a traceable \"white box\" process. This is particularly important in safety-sensitive fields (e.g., healthcare, autonomous driving), where DIKWP ensures that every step of AI reasoning is evidence-based and reviewable, significantly improving the credibility of decision-making. Based on the above advantages, the DIKWP artificial consciousness model is considered to be an important step towards explainable and high-level intelligence, which provides an innovative way to solve the current \"black box\" problem of large models and improve the controllability of AI systems.</p>\n<p>To sum up, this project is based on the major needs of the country, takes the neural mechanism of embodied intelligence and brain-like computing as the research theme, and introduces the DIKWP artificial consciousness framework in an attempt to break through the bottleneck of traditional agent design. Theoretically, the DIKWP model will provide a unified cognitive architecture for embodied intelligence, so that the system can have both data-driven perceptual learning capabilities and purpose-driven autonomous consciousness characteristics. In terms of application, this theory is expected to solve the current difficulties in biological perception-motion integration and spatial cognitive modeling, and promote the development of robots and autonomous agents in the direction of more intelligent and self-discipline. A large number of patented technological achievements of Professor Duan Yucong's team (covering cutting-edge directions such as artificial consciousness construction and cognitive operating systems) have been regarded as an important underlying support for safe, controllable and explainable AI in the future. Therefore, integrating the DIKWP model into embodied intelligence research is not only of great scientific significance, but also expected to provide a core technical reserve for China to achieve strategic leadership in the field of AGI.</p>\n<h1 id=\"2-Research-objectives-and-overall-technical-roadmap\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-Research-objectives-and-overall-technical-roadmap\" title=\"2. Research objectives and overall technical roadmap\"></a>2. Research objectives and overall technical roadmap</h1><p><strong>Research Objectives: This project aims to construct a set of brain-like intelligence systems that integrate the DIKWP model, so that artificial intelligence can form a prototype of cognition and consciousness through embodied interaction like living beings. Theoretically, the neural mechanisms of embodied intelligence</strong> (including perception-motor coupling, spatial cognition, self-intention, etc.) are revealed and explained by the DIKWP model. In terms of methodology, a brain-inspired computing framework was designed to realize an end-to-end agent model from perception acquisition, knowledge extraction to intention decision-making. In terms of application, an embodied intelligence prototype system was developed to verify the effectiveness of the model in scenarios such as autonomous robots, virtual agents, and cognitive enhancement of large models. The long-term goal of the project is to explore a new path based on the mechanism of biological intelligence, integrating the theory of artificial consciousness, and realizing autonomous, controllable, and explainable brain-like AGI.</p>\n<p>Overall technical route: This project will combine the five-layer cognitive structure and artificial consciousness framework of the DIKWP model, and adopt <strong>the route of \"biological experimental analysis→ mechanism modeling→ algorithm development →system integration</strong>\", and gradually achieve the research goal. Specifically, it is divided into the following five stages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Phase 1: Free Behavior Data Collection. Through the multimodal data collection and behavior recording of free-moving animals, a</strong> large-scale dataset and behavior map covering perceptual input (vision, hearing, posture, etc.) and motor output (behavioral action) are established to provide a basis for subsequent modeling. 【Objective】To obtain a large amount of data with high ecological potency, and to preliminarily describe the law of organism's perception-action cycle.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Phase 2: Neural Mechanism Modeling. Combined with the results of neuroscience experiments and machine learning methods, the data of Phase 1 were analyzed and modeled, and the key neural mechanisms of biological self-state perception and environmental representation were extracted. For example, the neural activity patterns of animal localization and navigation are analyzed, and the representation methods of spatial cognition are extracted. 【Objective】 To establish a</strong> mesh interaction computing and reasoning model corresponding to the \"data-information-knowledge\" layer in the DIKWP framework, to reveal the process of how perceptual information is transformed into knowledge representation, and to lay a foundation for higher-level intelligence and intention modeling.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Stage 3: Embodied Representation Learning. Based on the mechanism model of Phase 2, an algorithm that can independently learn the physical rules of the environment and the world model in the interaction is developed. Through the</strong> sensory-motor closed-loop experiment, the artificial intelligence can learn to predict the consequences of actions and form a causal cognition of the environment. 【Objective】 To construct the core model of the \"intelligence\" layer in the DIKWP framework, to realize the interpretable world model and strategic reasoning ability of the agent to the environment, so that it can produce reasonable decision-making and behavior in the simulated environment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Phase 4: Brain-inspired computational model construction. Based on the above modules, a complete DIKWP brain-like computing framework was designed</strong>. An efficient perception coding mechanism is introduced to compress the representation of multimodal perception. Realize rapid update modules, so that the model can learn online and continuously adapt. The intention modulation module is added for the goal-oriented regulation of injecting artificial consciousness. 【Objective】Develop a brain-inspired model with data-to-intent full-link processing capabilities, modularly realize the functions of each layer of DIKWP, and run efficiently on a general computing platform or brain-like chip, so as to prepare for system-level applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Phase 5: System Application Validation. Integrate the Phase 4 brain-like model into an actual embodied intelligence system (such as an autonomous robot or a bionic agent) to build an application demonstration prototype. Test and verify typical scenarios, including autonomous navigation, interactive operation, target recognition and decision-making in complex environments, etc. 【Objective】 The objective is to verify the performance of the DIKWP embodied intelligence system in real tasks, meet or exceed the index level required by the guidelines, and build an open platform for DIKWP embodied intelligence</strong>, so as to lay the foundation for subsequent promotion.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above route covers the complete chain from biological data acquisition, mechanism refinement to artificial system implementation, and scenario verification, and each stage is closely connected and progressive: the output (data, model) of the previous stage is used as the interface input to support the next stage of development, and the combination of data-driven and theoretical guidance is realized. Through this strategy of phased implementation in parallel with integrated verification, the achievement of research objectives and the accumulation of results are ensured.</p>\n<h1 id=\"3-Research-content-and-technical-route\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-Research-content-and-technical-route\" title=\"3. Research content and technical route\"></a>3. Research content and technical route</h1><p>According to the overall technical route, the research content and key technical solutions of each stage are subdivided as follows:</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-1-Behavior-graph-construction-and-perception-chain-analysis\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-1-Behavior-graph-construction-and-perception-chain-analysis\" title=\"3.1 Behavior graph construction and perception chain analysis\"></a>3.1 Behavior graph construction and perception chain analysis</h2><p><strong>Research content: This module corresponds to Phase 1 and aims to obtain and analyze the data basis for biological embodied behavior. On the one hand, we will select animals with typical free behavior paradigms (such as rodents' autonomous exploratory behaviors in open scenes) and use multimodal sensing technology to track their perception-motion processes in a long time</strong>。 The data collected includes: visual images (third-person camera and animal view), auditory signals, position information (GPS/positioning system), body kinematics data (accelerometer, gyroscope), and neural activity recordings (neuronal firing or EEG can be recorded simultaneously if possible). Through the method of machine learning, the time synchronization and fusion of multi-source data are carried out to reconstruct the movement trajectory and perception flow of animals in the environment.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, this module will introduce the concept of Behavior Atlas to model the graph structure of animal behavior sequences and perceptual inputs. Specifically, the key behavioral states of animals (such as foraging, exploration, obstacle avoidance, etc.) are used as the nodes of the graph, and the association between perceptual stimuli and action response is used as the edge to form an <strong>individual-environment interactive behavior map</strong>。 This kind of map can be seen as a depiction of the \"perception-action chain\" of animals in a free situation, reflecting a kind of causal chain. For example, when a specific visual signal appears in the environment, the probability that the animal will then take a certain action, etc. Through statistical analysis and pattern mining, we will extract the main perceptual chain (i.e., the sequence pattern from perception to behavior) to reveal the laws that organism perceives to drive behavior in different contexts.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical route: Firstly, a multi-modal data acquisition system is built</strong>, including high-definition camera arrays, miniature wearable sensors, etc., to realize synchronous data acquisition of experimental animals without restraint. Secondly, the data preprocessing and annotation pipeline was developed, and computer vision and signal processing technologies were used to denoise, extract features and automatically annotate behavioral events on the original data. For example, deep learning is used to detect animal posture and action categories in videos, and pattern recognition is used to identify relevant segments of neural signals and behaviors. Then, graph construction algorithms (such as time series association rule mining and causal discovery algorithms) are used to construct the processed sequence data into directed graphs or time series networks. Each node represents the information pattern perceived by the environment or the behavior state of the animal, and the edges represent the transition probability or causality from perception to action. Finally, combined with the concept of data layer and information layer of the DIKWP model, the semantic interpretation of the behavior graph is carried out: the original sensing data is regarded as \"data\", and the environmental cues and behavioral events extracted from it are upgraded to \"information\". Through DIKWP perceptual layer modeling, we can preliminarily verify the laws of agents in low-level <strong>data-information transformation, and lay a foundation for subsequent knowledge layer modeling.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Expected Results: This module will produce a free-behavior multimodal dataset and a corresponding behavior graph model</strong>. The size of the dataset is expected to be more than 10 hours of behavioral recording, including a wealth of perceptual-motor examples. The behavior map will quantitatively display the typical behavioral chains of animals, such as sequences such as \"hearing a sound→ turning the head to position→ moving closer\" and their probabilities. By analyzing the structure of the atlas, we expect to find several important rules, such as the time delay distribution of perceptual stimuli and motor responses, and <strong>the synergistic effect of multimodal stimuli on behavior choice. This study not only provides guidance for the modeling of biological neural mechanisms, but also verifies the applicability of the perception layer in the DIKWP model to</strong> the modeling of individual-environment interactions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-2-Individual-models-and-spatial-environment-modeling-mechanisms\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-2-Individual-models-and-spatial-environment-modeling-mechanisms\" title=\"3.2 Individual models and spatial environment modeling mechanisms\"></a>3.2 Individual models and spatial environment modeling mechanisms</h2><p><strong>Research content: This module corresponds to Phase 2, focusing on the neural mechanism of animal self-state perception and spatial environment modeling, and using the DIKWP framework to explain it hierarchically. With the help of behavioral data and existing neuroscience knowledge, we will build two levels of models: one is the individual layer model</strong>, which describes the mechanism of perception and representation of animals in their own state (such as position, orientation, and movement intention); The second is the environmental layer model, which describes the perception representation and internal modeling process of the animal on the external space (including the terrain layout, the location of the target, etc.).</p>\n<p>In terms of individual models, we focus on the ability of animals to locate themselves in the environment (i.e., ontological localization) and internal state cognitive mechanisms. For example, the vestibular system, proprioception, and motor copy signals in the mammalian brain work together to make animals aware of their position in space and the speed at which they move. There are also positional cells and grid cells in the hippocampus-entorhinal cortex system, which are thought to encode the current position and grid-like spatial coordinates, respectively, thus providing an intrinsic localization framework. We will try to reconstruct an autonomous position-aware model using the position trajectory data obtained in Phase 1 and the reports on relevant neural activity in the literature: the input can be a simulated vestibular acceleration signal and visual stream, and the model outputs the estimated self-coordinates and orientation through integration and pattern recognition. This process corresponds to the \"data→ information→ knowledge\" of DIKWP: the original sensory data is processed to extract meaningful information about one's own motion (e.g., speed, steering events), and then integrated into a knowledge representation of one's own state (e.g., inferring \"I am currently in a certain position in space\").</p>\n<p>In terms of environmental models, we study the neural mechanisms by which animals construct environmental cognitive maps. Organisms are able to gradually build internal models of their environment through exploration, such as remembering the distance and direction relationship of the places they encounter, the location of obstacles, the location of important targets, etc. Neuroscience studies have shown that the hippocampus not only localizes itself, but also encodes the topological relationships of the environment. The cerebral cortex vision and parietal lobe region abstract objects and topographical features in space. To model this capability, we will adopt a hierarchical spatial representation learning approach: the lower layer uses a deep neural network to extract environmental features from vision/radar data (corresponding to the information layer of DIKWP); In the middle layer, the graph structure or grid representation is used to integrate the location relationships obtained from multiple explorations to form an environmental topology map or cognitive map (corresponding to the knowledge layer). The high-level combination of reinforcement learning or planning algorithms enables the model to perform path inference and target search based on internal maps (corresponding to the intelligence layer). We will refer to the idea of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm, but add bio-inspired components, such as the brain-like hippocampus network for efficient map updates, and grid cell coding for the generation of continuous spatial coordinates.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical route: Firstly, by analyzing the spatial trajectory of the behavioral data in Phase 1, representative environmental scenarios</strong> (such as mazes and open fields) were selected for simulation and modeling. Then, a simulated environment was set up to repeat the animal's exploration process, and virtual sensing data and motion decisions were recorded. Then, for the individual model, a localization algorithm that fuses multi-source sensations is designed, such as Kalman filter fusion accelerometer and visual odometry, to achieve continuous estimation of one's own position. Or use a recurrent neural network to memorize a sequence of movements to predict the current position. For the environment model, a cognitive map learning algorithm was developed: topology maps (nodes represent places in the environment, edges represent reachability) and metric maps (continuous coordinate systems represent spaces) were used. We will explain this process by introducing the concept of information layer and knowledge layer in DIKWP <strong>– the information layer extracts useful information from the perception of the environment</strong> (e.g., the location of landmarks, obstacles), and the knowledge layer forms rules and models about the environment (e.g., \"room layout maps\" or \"navigation networks\"). Finally, by comparing the output of the model with the behavior of real animals, we test our hypotheses about neural mechanisms, such as whether the model reproduces the path integration ability of organisms, and whether it can maintain localization when occluded or some clues are missing like animals.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Results: This module will produce an embodied intelligent individual-environment cognitive model</strong> capable of exhibiting animal-like localization and navigation capabilities in a simulated environment. The specific achievements include: (1) <strong>Individual state perception module</strong>: realizes the self-position/posture estimation of the self-agent based on multi-sensory input, and its accuracy is close to that of the high-configuration sensor fusion algorithm, but the structure is closer to the biological mechanism. (2) <strong>Environmental Cognitive Map Module</strong>: It can learn the topology of the environment by exploring, and finally represent the environment in the form of a map or map to support subsequent path planning. (3) At the theoretical level, the hierarchical structure of DIKWP is used to explain the modeling process of spatial perception, and the progressive relationship of \"information-knowledge-wisdom\" in spatial understanding is clarified. This part of the results will provide the core algorithm for the subsequent construction of the world model, and also provide a new brain-like idea for the future robot navigation system.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-3-Perceptual-motor-coupling-and-world-model-construction\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-3-Perceptual-motor-coupling-and-world-model-construction\" title=\"3.3 Perceptual-motor coupling and world model construction\"></a>3.3 Perceptual-motor coupling and world model construction</h2><p><strong>Research content: This module corresponds to Phase 3, and the core is to realize the cyclic mechanism of perception-motion coupling on the bionic model, so that the agent can learn the world model through continuous interaction</strong>。 The so-called world model refers to the internal representation and simulation device of the external physical environment and its dynamic laws within the agent. The biological brain is thought to have an internal \"simulator\" capable of predicting the outcome of an action and adjusting behavioral strategies accordingly. This ability stems from the causal learning implicit in a lot of trial and error between perception and movement, such as the infant learning the rules of physics by constantly trying to manipulate objects. Our goal is for AI to interact with each other to gradually gain interpretable rule cognition of the environment, form a world model that can be internalized and deduced, and use the model to make intent-driven decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical route: We will adopt the \"Perception-Action Loop\" training paradigm</strong>. In the aforementioned simulation environment, the agent is allowed to make decisions based on its own perception, and then obtains feedback perception from the environment, and so on. In order for the agent to learn the environmental rules efficiently, it is necessary to implant reasonable structures and training objectives in the model: (1) <strong>Prediction model</strong>: Design a model that accepts the current state representation and candidate actions, and outputs the predicted next state or perception result. This can be achieved with neural networks, the training goal of which is to minimize errors with real-world feedback. Through continuous training, the model will capture the causal patterns of the environment (e.g., object dynamics, collision effects, etc.). (2) <strong>Explanatory rule extraction</strong>: In order to ensure that the physical rules of the model are explainable, we consider introducing symbolic learning or causal discovery methods to extract human-understandable rules from the prediction model. For example, by approximating the decision boundaries of a neural network through a decision tree or logistic regression, a rule in the form of an \"If-Then\" is extracted (e.g., \"If not supported, the object falls\"). (3) <strong>Reinforcement learning and intent guidance</strong>: At the same time, reinforcement learning is used to train the policy network of the agent, so that it can use the predictive model to make planning decisions, not just reflexive responses. The intelligence <strong>layer is equivalent to the agent's ability to use the world model to reason about and evaluate multiple action plans, and the intention layer provides guidelines for strategy selection, that is, to achieve the goal oriented to choose behavior. For example, we define the intrinsic goal of the agent (from the intent layer, such as navigating to a specific place, keeping itself safe, etc.), and let the reinforcement learning algorithm select the optimal action that satisfies the intent while considering the output of the prediction model.</strong></p>\n<p>In this process, we also investigate how perceptual-motor <strong>coupling can improve the generalization ability of the model. One hypothesis is that by unifying perceptions and representations of actions in cognitive processes</strong>, models can better understand \"physical cause and effect\" and thus rely less on specific senses to generalize from one type of environment to a new one. Therefore, we will try to have the middle representation of the world model accept both perceptual and motor inputs to learn a latent variable representation that fuses space-dynamic. This representation seeks to correspond to certain physical quantities in reality (e.g., momentum, force) to enhance the robustness of the model to environmental changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Outcomes: Through this module, it is expected to obtain: (1) a self-evolving world model: the</strong> agent can establish an internal simulation of environmental dynamics through its own exploration in the simulated environment, and its prediction accuracy reaches a certain standard (for example, the error in predicting the next state in a complex environment is lower than the threshold required by the guidelines). More importantly, we will extract a number of explicit physical rules to verify that the agent has indeed learned the laws of the environment, such as the conservation of collisions, the influence of gravity, etc., and express them in an interpretable form. (2) An intention-driven decision-making system: on the basis of the world model, the agent can make inferential decision-making according to the target intention. The metrics include: when given a new task goal, the agent can simulate a series of action plans through the internal model, and select the optimal plan to execute, and the success rate and efficiency are significantly better than those of the strategy without the world model. (3) Theoretically, it proves the value of the intelligence layer + intention layer in the DIKWP model to the agent's behavior choice: that is, the system with internal simulation and goal guidance has significantly improved its adaptability and decision-making rationality in unknown scenarios. This will become a key support for the construction of brain-like autonomics.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-4-Construction-of-brain-inspired-computing-framework\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-4-Construction-of-brain-inspired-computing-framework\" title=\"3.4 Construction of brain-inspired computing framework\"></a>3.4 Construction of brain-inspired computing framework</h2><p><strong>Research content: This module corresponds to Phase 4 and aims to integrate and develop an in-person intelligent brain-like computing framework based on the above mechanisms and models</strong>. Guided by the DIKWP model, this framework realizes the organic combination of functional modules at each layer, and focuses on achieving efficient, real-time, and adaptive engineering. We focus on three key technologies: <strong>[compressive sensing encoding]{.underline}</strong>, <strong>rapid update learning, and intent control mechanisms</strong> to comprehensively improve system performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Compressive sensing encoding mechanism: The perceptual system of the biological brain has amazing data compression and extraction capabilities, such as the human eye distilling huge visual data into sparse key features and transmitting them to the brain. Inspired by this, we will design an efficient perceptual coding module in the framework. This can be done by employing event-driven perception or attention mechanisms</strong> that focus only on changes or perceptual information relevant to the task at hand to reduce ineffective data transmission; Sparse representation and compressed sensing algorithms are used to greatly reduce the data dimension under the premise of ensuring that key information is not lost. For example, based on the information layer semantics of DIKWP, the original sensor data can be symbolized or represented by a feature map, so that the subsequent layer can directly process the high-level semantics instead of the massive raw data. The compressive sensing module will be embedded in the lower layer of the framework to realize edge-side preprocessing, ensure that the overall data throughput of the system is within the real-time range, and improve the efficiency of perception coding (the compression ratio and information retention rate are intended to be used as indicators).</p>\n<p><strong>Rapid update of learning modules: Embodied intelligence faces a dynamic and ever-changing environment, which requires the model to have continuous learning and online update capabilities. We will introduce brain-like synaptic plasticity and memory unit design into the framework, so that the system can quickly adapt to new knowledge and new situations. For example, drawing on the brain</strong>'s hippocampus-neocortex memory system, we can construct dual pathways for learning: one fast pathway for immediate memory (short-term memory, such as working memory modules) and the other for consolidating knowledge (long-term memory, such as through offline batch updates). In terms of algorithms, <strong>meta-learning or small-shot learning techniques can be used to allow the model to adjust internal parameters after a small amount of new data or a few interactions. We will also implement a modular update mechanism: when environmental changes are localized, only the parameters of the relevant modules are updated, and the rest of the modules remain stable, thus speeding up convergence. For example, if a change in ambient lighting primarily affects the Visual Perception module, you only need to update the model of the Perception Coding submodule. Through these means,</strong> each layer in the DIKWP framework will have a certain degree of autonomous evolution ability, especially the knowledge layer and the intelligence layer can refresh their cognition in real time with changes in the environment. We will evaluate the effect of rapid updates with metrics such as adaptation time constant, <strong>transfer learning performance, etc.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[Intention regulation module]{.underline}: This is one of the core innovations of the DIKWP framework that distinguishes it from the traditional architecture, aiming to simulate the unified regulation of various cognitive modules in the frontal lobe. We will develop a centralized intent management unit</strong> that stores and maintains the high-level state of the current system, such as goals, motivations, etc. On the one hand, the module applies guidance signals downwards to each level: for example, adjusting the attention focus of the perception module according to the current intention (similar to selective attention), adjusting the priority of knowledge retrieval, and influencing the preference function of the decision evaluation of the intelligence layer; On the other hand, it also upstreams feedback from modules for self-monitoring and intent updates. In terms of technical implementation, we may use reinforcement learning agents or logical rules to implement the unit of intent. For example, when the system detects that the current strategy deviates from the target, the intent module can send a signal to prompt the intelligent layer to re-plan the path. Or when long-term goals change, trigger a refactoring of the knowledge base to accommodate the new goals. The intent control module will also be responsible for interfacing with human users or high-level instructions to ensure that the system behavior is always under moral and safety constraints (which also corresponds to the regulation of AI behavior ethics by artificial consciousness).</p>\n<p><strong>Framework integration and brain-like implementation: After implementing each submodule, we will do framework-level integration. The distributed parallel computing architecture is used to simulate the parallel information processing of multiple regions of the brain, and the communication delay between each module is minimized. At the same time, we should pay attention to the adaptation of brain-like chips</strong>: select appropriate heterogeneous computing hardware (such as GPU acceleration, FPGA, neuromorphic chips, etc.) to deploy key algorithm modules to improve the energy efficiency ratio. For example, perceptual coding and partial neural network inference can be ported to a dedicated acceleration chip, and complex decisions and stored are executed on the CPU or in the cloud. Through the collaborative optimization of software and hardware, the whole system can reduce power consumption while meeting real-time performance, and have the ability to operate autonomously for a long time.</p>\n<p>**Expected Results: This module will eventually produce a complete implementation of the DIKWP embodied intelligent brain-like computing framework, including software architecture and hardware deployment scheme. The specific landmark achievements are: (**1) <strong>Modular prototype system</strong>: realize the integrated operation of the five-layer modules of data, information, knowledge, wisdom and intent, the internal interface and information flow are clear, and the functions of each module are verified by unit tests. (2) <strong>Key technical indicators meet the standards</strong>: such as the perceptual data compression ratio reaches the expected goal (improving the efficiency by several times), the model update is completed in seconds, and the decision-making frequency meets the real-time requirements (for example, the ≥Hz level). (3) <strong>Brain-like characteristics are verified in the experimental environment</strong>: the system shows a certain degree of fault tolerance and robustness, and the whole can still degrade and operate when the local module fails (similar to the functional compensation after brain injury); Good interpretive skills and goal-driven behaviors in test tasks. For example, for a complete decision-making process, we are able to trace the results of each layer of processing and have the system explain \"why the behavior was taken\" to prove that its artificial awareness module works. The framework will serve as the foundation for the next phase of system adoption, preparing the ground for building a usable embodied intelligence platform.</p>\n<h1 id=\"4-Feasibility-analysis\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-Feasibility-analysis\" title=\"4. Feasibility analysis\"></a>4. Feasibility analysis</h1><p><strong>Research basis: This project relies on the profound accumulation of artificial consciousness, neural computing and brain-like systems by Professor Duan Yucong and his team. Professor Duan Yucong's team took the lead in proposing the DIKWP artificial consciousness model and has achieved a series of achievements in this field. In terms of theoretical research, the team started the research on the expansion of the DIKW system as early as the 2010s, developed the methods of knowledge graph and cognitive semantics, and relied on the \"\" in 2020</strong>The research on \"Graph Expansion and Modeling of DIKW Knowledge System\" won the third prize of Wu Wenjun Science and Technology Award, the highest award of Chinese artificial intelligence. Since then, the team has continued to deepen the DIKWP theory, published a number of high-level papers in the fields of knowledge representation, semantic computing, artificial consciousness evaluation, etc., and applied for a large number of related invention patents. According to reports, as of the beginning of 2025, Professor Duan Yucong, as the first inventor, has been authorized 114 invention patents (including 15 PCT international patents), covering a wide range of fields such as large model training, artificial consciousness construction, cognitive operating system, and AI governance. These achievements are regarded as an important foundation for future explainable and secure AI, and provide solid technical support for the move towards AGI.</p>\n<p>Talent and team: The team has a multidisciplinary research team, with core members including experts in artificial intelligence, computational neuroscience, robotics, cognitive psychology and other fields. Professor Duan Yucong is currently a Corresponding Member of the National Academy of Artificial Intelligence of the United States, a Foreign Academician of the National Academy of Sciences of Serbia, an Academician of the International Academy of Advanced Technology and Engineering, and the Chairman of the World Association of Artificial Consciousness. There are not only senior researchers in the team who are responsible for algorithm and theoretical research, but also engineers and technicians who are responsible for system development, so as to realize the equal emphasis on scientific research and engineering implementation. This cross-disciplinary talent structure ensures that all aspects of the project, from neural mechanism research to software and hardware implementation, are professionally supported.</p>\n<p><strong>Research conditions: The team has built a special DIKWP artificial awareness laboratory</strong>, equipped with advanced software and hardware resources. In terms of hardware, the laboratory has GPU clusters and high-performance computing servers for large-scale model training and brain-like simulation operations. Equipped with a variety of robots and sensing equipment, it can carry out embodied intelligent physical experiments; It is also planned to introduce domestic advanced brain-like chip breadboards for new architecture verification. In terms of software, the team has developed tools such as the DIKWP white-box assessment framework to test the cognitive processes of AI in a layered manner. In addition, the team has established cooperative relations with well-known domestic scientific research institutions (such as the Institute of Neuroscience, the Key Laboratory of Robotics, etc.), and can receive assistance in the development of biological experiment data and biomimetic algorithms. A good foundation for multidisciplinary cooperation will ensure the smooth implementation of the project.</p>\n<p>Risk control: This project is challenging, but the team's existing research base reduces the main technical risks. For example, the theoretical perfection and early verification of the DIKWP model will reduce the possibility of detours in the framework design. The data noise and uncertainty that may be encountered in free behavior data collection can be controlled by the white-box evaluation and data cleaning technology in the team's patent. Each sub-project has corresponding pre-research results or technical reserves, and once technical difficulties arise, the team also has the ability to quickly adjust the plan through domestic and foreign cooperation and its own experience. As a result, the project is highly viable.</p>\n<h1 id=\"5-Milestones-and-milestones\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#5-Milestones-and-milestones\" title=\"5. Milestones and milestones\"></a>5.

These phased results will be gradually accumulated to achieve the overall goal of the project.</p>\n<h1 id=\"6-Assessment-indicators-and-results-form\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#6-Assessment-indicators-and-results-form\" title=\"6. Assessment indicators and results form\"></a>6. Assessment indicators and results form</h1><p>In order to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of the project, we have formulated an assessment system at two levels: technical indicators and achievement forms:</p>\n<p><strong>Technical assessment indicators:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Perceptual encoding efficiency: measures the ability of the perceptual layer to compress and extract raw data. For example, based on the proportion of compressed data in the original data and the information retention rate, the goal is to compress the amount of data to less than 20% of the original amount while ensuring 95% of the valid information. This indicator reflects the efficiency of the system in processing multimodal perception information in real time.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Prediction accuracy and real-time: It measures the accuracy of the prediction of the environmental state and the timeliness of decision-making by the intelligent layer world model. Specifically, in the standard physical test, the prediction error of the model for the next time state MSE is lower than the specified threshold; In a dynamic decision-making task, the calculation delay of each decision does not exceed a millisecond-level upper limit. This metric ensures that the system has a high-quality environmental model and rapid response capabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Modeling versatility: Evaluate the ability of the system to adapt to new environments and tasks. The performance degradation and recovery time of the model in the changing scenario are quantified. For example, the navigation success rate decreases by no more than 30% at the initial stage after changing the environment, and returns to more than 90% of the original performance after learning adjustment. The convergence speed of new task training is X times higher than that of traditional models. This indicator reflects the universality and portability of the DIKWP framework in different applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>DIKWP module function implementation and verification: Confirm that all five layers of modules in the system are implemented, and verify their independent functions and cooperation effects through testing. This includes: the data/information layer can correctly extract the key features of the environment, the knowledge layer can store inference rules, the intelligence layer can make reasonable decisions in complex situations, and the intention layer can effectively guide behavior choices. We will use the team's existing DIKWP white-box assessment system</strong> to conduct a qualitative and quantitative assessment of each layer exposed by the white-box. Metrics in the form of indicators such as the accuracy of the output of each layer, the sensitivity of the system to intervention (such as manually modifying the output of a certain layer), etc., to verify the effective closure of the entire DIKWP chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Artificial Consciousness and Explanatory Power: Evaluate the interpretability of the system's decision-making process and whether it reflects the characteristics of artificial consciousness. This is done by checking whether the system can output human-understandable decision-making basis in real-time prediction and behavior selection. For example, for each action decision, the system is able to give an explanation (expressed in natural language or logical rules) based on its knowledge and intent, and correspond to the actual effect. We will introduce the \"<strong>Consciousness Level Test</strong>\", which refers to the white-box cognitive assessment indicators proposed by the team to evaluate whether the system's ability in perception, knowledge, wisdom, and intention is sound. The goal is to achieve a predetermined level of awareness assessment score at the end of the project, proving that it has significantly improved its autonomy and purpose.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Form of Output:</strong> The project is expected to produce a wealth of research results and practical products, including but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Publications: He has published no less than 5 papers in top journals such as artificial intelligence and neuroscience, systematically expounding the theoretical methods and experimental results of the DIKWP embodied intelligence model. At the same time, write monographs or research reports, condense the academic ideas of the project, and form a technical white paper for external release.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Intellectual property rights: The new algorithms and new devices generated in the research process will actively apply for domestic and foreign invention patents, and it is expected that no less than 3 authorized patents will be issued to consolidate the independent intellectual property rights of technological innovation achievements.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Software and hardware systems: Deliver the DIKWP Embodied Intelligence Open Platform</strong> (see the next section for details) as an important outcome form of the project. The platform includes a suite of software toolkits, such as a source code repository for the Brain-like Cognitive Framework, a dataset and model library, a white-box evaluation tool, and a demonstration application programming interface (API). In terms of hardware, we have completed the prototype of a brain-inspired computing system (a robot or embedded device that can run in a laboratory environment) and provided a simulation interface on an open platform for users to try.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Standards and specifications: Participate in the formulation of technical standards or guidelines in related fields based on project experience. For example, we will promote</strong> the research and formulation of artificial awareness assessment standards and <strong>embodied intelligence interface specifications, so as to feed back the industrial supervision and academic community with the results.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Talent training: Through the implementation of the project, a group of interdisciplinary talents will be cultivated, including postdoctoral fellows, doctoral students and engineers. It is expected to train no less than 10 talents to further expand the research team of brain-like intelligence and artificial consciousness in China.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"7-Application-Promotion-Programs\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#7-Application-Promotion-Programs\" title=\"7. Application &amp; Promotion Programs\"></a>7. Application &amp; Promotion Programs</h1><p>The research results of this project will be oriented to multiple application fields to promote the implementation and expansion of embodied intelligence technology:</p>\n<p><strong>(1) Embodied intelligent robots: The DIKWP brain-like model of this project is applied in the fields of service robots and industrial robots to significantly improve its autonomy and adaptability. For example, the system is deployed on the home service robot to enable it to grasp the layout of the home environment and the owner's preference through continuous learning, so as to achieve more flexible housekeeping assistance; The application of industrial mobile robots allows them to autonomously plan paths, avoid emerging obstacles, and optimize handling efficiency in dynamic production floors. Due to the modular transparency of the DIKWP architecture, the cause of the robot's decision-making error can be traced and corrected in time, improving reliability and safety. This will yield direct benefits in robotics scenarios that require a high degree of autonomy, such as smart manufacturing, medical care, and emergency rescue. The project team will work with robot manufacturers to build pilot demonstrations and promote technology transfer.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(2) Autonomous agents and unmanned systems: The results of this project are also applicable to autonomous systems such as unmanned vehicles and drones, as well as intelligent game agents. By fusing the DIKWP model, these agents will gain stronger environmental understanding and decision-making capabilities. For example, driverless cars can use this framework to achieve hierarchical cognition of the traffic environment, from raw sensor data to traffic knowledge, to driving intention decision-making, to improve the reliability of perception and decision-making interpretation, and meet the requirements of autonomous driving for safety and controllability. UAV swarms can use the intent layer for task assignment and cooperative flight to ensure that the overall mission goal is achieved. In video games and virtual environments, the introduction of embodied intelligent agents can create more realistic AI behaviors, give \"awareness\" and \"purpose\" to game characters, and enhance the interactive experience and training value. The team plans to test the multi-agent collaboration task on the simulation platform to verify the potential of the framework in multi-agent systems.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(3) Expansion of cognitive ability of large models: The DIKWP artificial awareness framework can also be used to improve the cognitive ability and interpretability of current large-scale pre-trained models (such as large language models and visual-language models). In the absence of environmental interaction and autonomy, the current large model has the \"black box\" problem of understanding limitations and unexplainable decision-making. Our solution is to integrate the cognitive chain of DIKWP around the large model: through the \"model servitization\" method, the output of the large model is used as the data/information input of the DIKWP framework, and then processed by the knowledge and intelligence layer, and the results are screened and adjusted by the intent layer. This is equivalent to equipping the large model with a \"thinking brain\" to reflect, verify, and guide the purpose of the answers it gives. For example, in the Q&amp;A system, after the large language model generates a preliminary answer, the DIKWP intelligence layer can verify the correctness of the answer according to the knowledge base, and the intent layer adjusts the answer style or depth according to the user's intent, and finally outputs a more accurate response that meets the user's needs. In addition, we can use the \"knowledge quotient\" (artificial awareness level) white-box assessment system developed by the team to evaluate the large model, find out its shortcomings in knowledge, wisdom, and intention, and then make up for it through the DIKWP model. Such AI system integration is expected to make existing AI \"smarter and more reliable\" and play a greater role in applications such as intelligent customer service and decision-making assistance.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(4) Model servitization and platform openness: In order to promote industry-university-research applications, this project will provide model services and development interfaces on the DIKWP embodied intelligence open platform. On the one hand, various functional modules, such as the perceptual coding service, the world model inference service, and the intent decision service, are deployed through the microservice architecture for different applications to call on demand. This model as a service makes it easy for developers to integrate our brain-inspired intelligence functions into their respective products, without having to build an embodied intelligence system from scratch. On the other hand, the open platform will provide standardized data interfaces and evaluation benchmarks to</strong> reduce the cost of external team access. The platform also plans to open up part of the source code and demonstration applications, encourage secondary development and module replacement, and make it a shared testing ground in the field of embodied intelligence. By holding developer competitions and workshops, we will gradually expand the influence of the DIKWP open platform, attract universities and enterprises to participate, form an ecological cycle, and accelerate technological evolution.</p>\n<p><strong>(5) Adaptation and industrial transformation of brain-inspired chips: This project forward-looking layout of new hardware such as brain-inspired chips to ensure the long-term competitiveness of the results. In the later stage of the research, we will cooperate with relevant domestic enterprises to try to transplant the DIKWP framework to dedicated brain-inspired computing hardware, such as spiking-like neural network chips, heterogeneous fusion chips, etc. This will verify the performance of our algorithm on low-power, high-parallel hardware, and tailor the algorithm to take advantage of the advantages of the chip (e.g., using spiking neural networks to implement event-driven intents for the block). Once the verification is successful, we will actively promote cooperation with chip manufacturers and machine enterprises to promote the integration of software and hardware solutions, and realize applications in robot controllers, unmanned system navigation equipment and other products. These transformation efforts are expected to be carried out through horizontal projects or achievement incubation, and will continue to be carried out after the completion of the project, and finally realize the industrial implementation of the technology.</strong></p>\n<p>In summary, while completing the scientific research task, this project will promote the application of the results through multiple channels, from academic impact to industrial value. By building an open platform and ecosystem, we are confident that the DIKWP model will become an important basic framework in the field of embodied intelligence and artificial consciousness, and will be adopted by a wider range of researchers and engineers, so as to continuously iterate and improve, and help China take the initiative in the future intelligent technology competition.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

However, this kind of \"data-driven\" approach with relevance learning at its core also faces significant limitations. For example, large-scale pretrained models (LLMs) are capable of generating fluent text and complex responses, but their internal inference processes are like a \"black box\" and lack interpretability and autonomy. Models often lack self-awareness and purpose orientation, and are unable to truly understand semantics, let alone set goals or review their own decisions. As a result, current AI systems <strong>have encountered a bottleneck on the road to general intelligence (AGI): on the one hand, it is difficult to ensure that decisions are always in line with human values, and on the other hand, they are prone to hallucinations</strong>, biases, or uncontrollable behaviors in an open environment. It can be said that the <strong>existing paradigm lacks the description of the higher-order cognitive and consciousness mechanisms of the human brain, and</strong> cannot meet the needs of the next generation of intelligent development.</p>\n<p>In order to break through the above bottlenecks, the academic community and the industry have begun to realize <strong>[the necessity of the development of brain-like intelligence]{.underline}</strong>, that is, to reconstruct the AI system by drawing on the cognitive architecture and consciousness mechanism of the human brain, so as to achieve a qualitative change from \"being able to perceive\" to \"being able to know\" and \"understanding to reflect\". This trend has been hailed as a revolutionary shift from traditional artificial intelligence to \"<strong>intelligent self-knowledge</strong>\". In this context, <strong>the DIKWP model proposed by Professor Duan Yucong points out a new direction for the development of artificial intelligence.</strong> DIKWP stands for <strong>Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom-Purpose, and adds the highest level of \"intention/purpose\" to the classical DIKW (pyramid) system. This improvement enables the model to form a semantic closed loop from the bottom perception to the high-level purpose</strong>, and supports two-way feedback and iterative update of semantics at all levels. The DIKWP model essentially introduces a \"purpose-driven\" cognitive framework: the data and information layer processes external perception and pattern recognition, the knowledge and intelligence layer realizes understanding and reasoning, and the purpose layer acts as the supreme conductor to provide goal constraints and value guidance. This new cognitive system is an academic milestone, providing an innovative way to solve the \"black box\" problem of current large models and improve the interpretability and controllability of AI systems.</p>\n<p>More importantly, after the DIKWP model introduces \"intent\", it gives the AI system a common cognitive language, so that every step of the AI decision-making process can be traced and understood by humans. By embedding \"purpose\" into the model, AI decisions are no longer based solely on data relevance, but always revolve around a clear goal. Not only does this make AI \"smarter\" and more autonomous to plan and reflect, but it also ensures that it always serves human values and safety needs. It can be considered that the Artificial Consciousness (AC) system is a key support for the realization of AGI through this purpose-driven cognitive architecture that gives AI a human-like ability to self-regulate and reflect. At the theoretical level, consciousness is considered by many scholars to be an important part of general intelligence, and a self-aware system is more likely to have the ability to understand, create, and learn independently. This is reflected in the DIKWP model: the purpose system at the top of the model is equivalent to the \"will\" and \"self\" of the AI, providing the internal driving force for the continuous evolution of the system.</p>\n<p><strong>The theoretical support role of artificial consciousness system on AGI can be seen from this: by introducing an architecture similar to human consciousness,</strong> AI will have the ability of global planning, active learning, self-correction, etc., so that it will evolve from a passive tool to an active agent. Professor Duan Yucong's research shows that an artificial consciousness system can be seen as a combination of \"subconscious mind system (LLM) + consciousness system (DIKWP)\". Among them, large models such as LLM assume pattern matching and associative functions similar to the human subconscious, and the DIKWP system is like a \"waking consciousness\" <strong>responsible for high-level decision-making and purpose management. These two parts work together to make AI both possessive of a wealth of knowledge and experience (subconscious) and self-reflective and purpose-oriented (conscious). This brain-like dual-system architecture is considered to be an effective way to achieve strong artificial intelligence, which not only theoretically provides a new perspective for simulating human consciousness, but also provides a potential solution to solve the challenges of semantic bias and value alignment in AI systems.</strong></p>\n<p>In summary, this project is based on the DIKWP model and artificial consciousness theory, aiming to break through the limitations of the current AI paradigm and explore a new generation of model system of brain-like intelligence. By **organically integrating the five layers of data-information-knowledge-intelligence-purpose and introducing a purpose-driven artificial consciousness architecture, the project hopes to build a brain-like model with a prototype of self-awareness. This model will theoretically enrich the simulation of cognition and consciousness by artificial intelligence, improve the interpretability and autonomy of AI systems in engineering, and lay the foundation for the realization of general artificial intelligence in application. This is not only of great significance for solving the current \"big model black box\" dilemma, but also will promote AI from \"intelligence\" to \"intelligence\", and take a key step towards strong artificial intelligence (**AGI).</p>\n<h1 id=\"2、A-review-of-the-current-research-status-at-home-and-abroad\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2、A-review-of-the-current-research-status-at-home-and-abroad\" title=\"2、A review of the current research status at home and abroad\"></a><strong>2、A review of the current research status at home and abroad</strong></h1><p>With the continuous revelation of the working mechanism of the human brain, <strong>brain-like intelligence has become one of the cutting-edge hotspots of global artificial intelligence research. Abroad, as early as the 2010s,</strong> IBM and other companies launched brain-like chips and cognitive computing programs, such as IBM TrueNorth synaptic chips trying to simulate human brain neuron connections from the hardware level to achieve low-energy intelligent processing. Academia has also developed concepts such as <strong>Global Workspace Theory ([GWT]{.underline}) and Integrated Information Theory ([IIT]{.underline}). ) and other theories of consciousness to explore the possible ways to achieve machine consciousness. These theoretical models explain consciousness from the perspectives of cognitive psychology and neural information integration, respectively: GWT sees consciousness as a broadcast \"blackboard\" in the brain, where key information is broadcast in the global workspace for different modules to access; IIT, on the other hand, attempts to quantitatively measure the degree of consciousness of a system using information entropy and causality. However, most of these theories of consciousness belong to the category of cognitive science and philosophy, and they are still preliminary in terms of engineering implementation. A large number of foreign teams have tried to integrate ideas such as GWT into AI architectures, such as the LIDA cognitive architecture proposed by Stan Franklin et al., which simulates the cycle of consciousness and attention</strong>, and [institutions such as DeepMind]{.underline} have also begun to pay attention to the Free Energy Principle ([FEP]{.underline}). ) in cognitive intelligence. However, in general, <strong>AI systems with real autonomous consciousness have not yet emerged</strong>, and artificial consciousness is still in the exploration stage from theory to engineering.</p>\n<p>At the same time, <strong>large model (pre-trained model) technology is developing rapidly around the world, such as</strong> <strong>[OpenAI]{.underline}GPT series, Google's BERT/PaLM and DeepMind's Gato, etc. These models have demonstrated unprecedented performance in general-purpose language understanding and multimodal processing, and are seen in part as a promise for AGI. However, large models also expose problems such as insufficient knowledge and reasoning ability, and lack of goal drive. On the one hand, the traditional large model mainly obtains correlation mapping through massive data training, lacks explicit knowledge representation and logical reasoning mechanism, and is prone to hallucinations that are inconsistent with facts</strong>。 On the other hand, they are not embedded in long-term goals or value systems of their own, and need to rely on training goals provided by humans or later artificial feedback adjustments (e.g., RLHF). As a result, large models have limited capabilities in complex decision-making and long-term planning, as well as hidden dangers in value alignment and security. In recent years, some explorations have begun to emerge internationally to enhance the cognitive ability and controllability of large models. For example, Microsoft et al. have tried to integrate symbolic logic and knowledge graphs into pre-trained models to improve reasoning and common sense skills. OpenAI and others have introduced the use of tools and chain-of-thought prompts to enable the model to simulate the step-by-step reasoning process when solving problems. However, these improvements are still peripheral enhancements, and the model has not been refactored from the architectural level, which cannot fundamentally solve the inherent limitations of the \"lack of self-awareness\" of the large model.</p>\n<p>In this context, domestic scientific research forces are also actively exploring new paths for artificial consciousness and brain-like models. In general, the research layout of brain-inspired intelligence in China mainly includes: brain-inspired chips and computing architectures for simulating neural computing (such as the brain simulation engineering of the Institute of Brain Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences), <strong>cognitive and neural computing models</strong> (such as the work of Tsinghua Brain-inspired Computing Center), and cognitive robots and autonomous systems. However, compared with Europe and the United States, China started late in the theory of \"artificial consciousness\" and its practical exploration. However, what is remarkable is that the <strong>DIKWP artificial consciousness model proposed by Professor Duan Yucong's team provides a unique innovative starting point for related research in China. Professor Duan Yucong took the lead in extending the classical DIKW model into the DIKWP framework and applied it to the artificial consciousness system to construct a network cognitive structure</strong>. This work has enabled China to form a theoretical system of independent innovation in the field of artificial consciousness, and has laid a first-mover advantage through the accumulation of a series of patents. According to reports, Professor Duan Yucong is the first inventor of 114 authorized invention patents, covering many cutting-edge directions from large model training, artificial consciousness construction, cognitive operating system to AI governance and privacy security. Although these patented technologies have not yet been industrialized on a large scale, they have attracted extensive attention in the research on AI interpretability, security and value alignment, and are regarded as important \"underlying codes\" to lead the future.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Duan Yucong's team has made a number of exploratory achievements in the engineering implementation of the artificial consciousness model. For example, they proposed the concept of DIKWP ×DIKWP dual-loop architecture, that is, introducing a metacognitive loop in addition to the basic cognitive process for self-monitoring and self-reflection. This architecture is similar to the human thinking process of thinking before thinking (i.e., \"conscious consciousness\"), <strong>which is considered to be the key path to give AI initial self-awareness, and represents a new direction for AI to move towards autonomous consciousness. In addition, the team embedded the DIKWP model into the large language model and proposed a plan to build a \"semantic operating system\", decomposing the LLM inference process into five monitorable links: data, information, knowledge, wisdom, and intent. Each link has a clear mathematical definition and semantic representation to ensure that the AI decision-making process can be checked step by step, thereby greatly improving the security and controllability of the system. This innovation is also unique in the world: in contrast, OpenAI has a small number of patents, while Google and Huawei, although they have rich patent reserves in other fields of AI, they have a relatively fragmented layout in cognitive structure innovation, and DIKWP-related patent portfolios are known for being systematic and innovative, and have a high voice in the world.</strong></p>\n<p>The current status of international research shows that artificial consciousness and brain-like intelligence are in the stage of moving from concept to prototype, and various theoretical frameworks (such as GWT, IIT, FEP, DIKWP, etc.) have their own emphasis. By introducing an intent-driven mesh cognitive architecture, the DIKWP model in China theoretically integrates data-knowledge processing and purpose-oriented, and preliminarily realizes the artificial consciousness prototype system DIKWP-AC with small model and low computing power in practice. According to reports, in 2023, Duan Yucong's team at Hainan University developed the world's first small-model, low-computing power, and explainable artificial consciousness software prototype system DIKWP-AC, which is divided into \"mathematical subsystem\" <strong>and</strong> \"physiological subsystem\".<strong>Two parts. The mathematical subsystem is responsible for internal semantic reasoning, and the physiological subsystem is responsible for interacting with the external environment, so as to simulate the combination of cognition and body. The team collaborated with Hainan Provincial People's Hospital to apply DIKWP-AC to the diagnosis and treatment of gout, lupus and other diseases to verify the effectiveness of the artificial awareness model in complex decision-making tasks. In general, the research on the combination of large models and cognitive architecture at home and abroad is in the ascendant, and the DIKWP model, as an artificial consciousness framework independently proposed by China, has been at the forefront of exploration, providing valuable experience and theoretical reserves for the construction of a new generation of brain-like intelligence.</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"3、Research-objectives-and-content\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3、Research-objectives-and-content\" title=\"3、Research objectives and content\"></a><strong>3、Research objectives and content</strong></h1><p>The overall goal of this project is to build a brain-like large model system with preliminary artificial consciousness characteristics based on the DIKWP model, and break through the limitations of current AI in terms of cognitive ability and autonomous consciousness. Specifically, we will design the corresponding five core subsystems of data collection, information fusion, knowledge modeling, intelligence evolution, and purpose control around the five-layer mapping relationship of DIKWP, and make them organically integrated to form a hierarchical and progressive cognitive system with network interaction. The design objectives and contents of each subsystem are summarized as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Data acquisition system</strong>: Establish a perception layer that simulates biological sensation to realize the acquisition and preprocessing of multi-source heterogeneous data. The system will integrate multi-modal sensing and data filtering mechanisms, including the collection, annotation and preliminary processing of multi-modal data such as vision, hearing, and text. The function of the human primary sensory cortex is simulated by neural computerization, and the key features in the original data are extracted to provide input for the information layer. The goal of this system is to efficiently extract useful information and ensure data quality in massive real-time data, and measurable indicators include multi-modal data alignment accuracy, noise filtering effect, and real-time data processing throughput.</p>\n<p><strong>Information fusion system</strong>: realize multi-modal fusion and semantic extraction of perceptual data, and simulate the unified representation process of sensory information by the human brain. The system will use the Transformer architecture combined with the explicit semantic coding of the DIKWP information layer to perform pattern recognition, classification and preliminary semantic understanding of the features from the data layer. The core research contents include cross-modal feature fusion, context-sensitive information association, and structured representation. The goal is to establish associations between information from different modalities and sources to form a preliminary cognitive representation of the environment and tasks. Metrics can include consistency of multimodal semantic representations, accuracy of information extraction, and improved performance in downstream cognitive tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Knowledge modeling system</strong>: Construct a knowledge representation and reasoning mechanism based on the DIKWP knowledge layer, and endow the model with long-term memory and logical reasoning ability. We will integrate knowledge graph, symbolic logic, and deep learning to achieve interpretable knowledge storage and deduction. The system is responsible for mapping the semantic data output by the information layer into structured knowledge representations (such as graph nodes and relationships), and generating new knowledge or decision-making basis through inference algorithms (deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, etc.). His research interests include knowledge acquisition and updating (automatic extraction of new knowledge from data and contradiction resolution), <strong>knowledge representation learning</strong> (combination of vector representation and symbolic representation), and inference engine (combination of rule reasoning and probabilistic reasoning). The indicators of the system can be evaluated by the coverage of the knowledge base, the accuracy of reasoning, the length of the reasoning chain, etc., and the goal is to achieve the in-depth understanding and application of domain knowledge by the machine.</p>\n<p><strong>Intelligent Evolution System</strong>: Realizing high-order cognition and adaptive evolution capabilities in the DIKWP intelligence layer is equivalent to simulating the formation process of human intelligence. The system will comprehensively use the information provided by the knowledge layer to carry out decision planning, strategy optimization, and experience learning, so that AI can continuously improve its performance in a dynamic environment. His research focuses on <strong>complex decision-making</strong> (decision-making algorithms that take into account multiple factors and uncertainties), <strong>continuous learning</strong> (task drills and feedback reinforcement to optimize strategies), <strong>ethics, and value</strong> judgments (Introduce value constraints and security considerations in decision-making). A key feature of intelligent evolutionary systems is the ability to be self-reflective—the ability to assess the consequences of one's own decisions and adjust cognitive strategies when needed. The performance of the system can be measured by the rate of task completion in complex environments, the assessment of the quality of decisions (e.g., compliance with expected goals and safety specifications), and the speed of adaptation under changing conditions. The goal is for AI to show human-like flexibility and intelligence, and to be able to draw inferences from unknown tasks and continuously improve.</p>\n<p><strong>Purpose control system</strong>: As the implementation of the DIKWP purpose layer, it is the top-level control center and power source of the whole model. The system is responsible for generating, maintaining, and adjusting the AI's internal goals (intentions), and regulating the lower layers through two-way feedback. Research topics include: <strong>purpose expression and understanding</strong> (designing an internal goal representation language for AI so that it can represent short-term task goals and long-term goals), <strong>purpose generation mechanisms</strong> (dynamically generating or adjusting intentions according to external needs and internal states, simulating human characteristics such as curiosity-driven and autonomous goal setting), <strong>purpose assessment, and conflict management</strong>(Ability to assess priorities and make trade-offs when multiple intents coexist or conflict with environmental constraints). The purpose control system will also implement metacognitive functions, monitor the state of AI in the process of achieving goals, and trigger a self-correction process once it deviates from the goal or has an abnormality (which corresponds to the metacognitive cycle in the aforementioned dual-loop architecture). Metrics to measure the system include the rationality and diversity of purpose generation, the goal achievement rate, and the system's ability to correct purpose biases. The ultimate goal is for AI to be continuously self-motivated, able to autonomously adjust behavior according to changes in the internal and external environment, so as to better complete the overall task.</p>\n<p>In order to ensure that the above five subsystems work together, a clear technical roadmap will be developed: first, the formal semantics and mutual mapping of the various levels will be defined theoretically, and then the engineering implementation will gradually integrate the systems using a modular architecture. In the initial stage, we will focus on <strong>the integration of the data/information layer and the modeling of the knowledge layer</strong>, so as to lay a good foundation for high-level wisdom and intention. In the medium term, the wisdom evolution mechanism is introduced to realize the leap from knowledge to wisdom; In the later stage, we will focus on the emergence of purpose regulation and self-consciousness, and build an artificial consciousness structure that completes the dual cycle. Test scenarios will be developed simultaneously at each stage of development to verify the functions of the system in terms of perception and understanding, knowledge reasoning, decision evolution, and goal management. Through the step-by-step technical path design, we will build a hierarchical and interconnected prototype of the DIKWP brain-like model, and draw a detailed roadmap from basic research to application to provide guidance for the smooth implementation of the project.</p>\n<h1 id=\"4、Technical-route-and-innovation-point\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4、Technical-route-and-innovation-point\" title=\"4、Technical route and innovation point\"></a><strong>4、Technical route and innovation point</strong></h1><p>The technical route of this project follows the five-layer logic architecture of DIKWP, and on this basis, it integrates the network artificial consciousness design of perception-cognition-reasoning-reflection. The core idea is to realize the unity of bottom-up data-driven and top-down purpose regulation through dual-loop interaction, so that AI systems can have a human-like cognitive-introspection <strong>cycle. The traditional computing system proposed by Turing is a linear input-output process, while our DIKWP mesh architecture is closer to the parallel distributed processing of the human brain</strong>: each layer is divided according to its function, and it is connected into a network through feedback, so as to realize the repeated iteration of information between different levels of abstraction. The technical route can be summarized as follows: first, the low-level perception and information processing provide the original materials; The middle-level knowledge and wisdom module integrates and sublimates the material; The purpose module of the upper level imposes guidance and correction on the lower level according to the overall goal; At the same time, the upper management also obtains environmental feedback from the lower level to form a closed-loop regulation.</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, there are two cycles within the system: one is the basic cognitive cycle (perception→ cognition→ reasoning → decision-making), which completes the closed loop from perception to action; The second is the metacognitive cycle (reflection→ purpose adjustment→ re-cognition), which monitors and regulates the basic cycle. In terms of specific implementation, the purpose control system acts as the core of metacognition, constantly monitoring the state of the knowledge layer and the intelligence layer, and initiating a reflection mechanism to adjust the strategies of the knowledge and intelligence layer if it identifies that the decision is inconsistent with the intended purpose or the model is uncertain. This mesh architecture ensures the efficient propagation of information and control flows within the system: it can quickly feed environmental changes to high-level intents from the bottom up (enabling AI to perceive new situations and change goals), or it can quickly communicate new purpose requirements to lower-level modules from top to bottom (making perception and cognition optimized for new goals). <strong>Bi-directional, multi-level feedback makes the system highly flexible and robust, which is a significant advantage that cannot be achieved with traditional one-way pipelined AI architectures.</strong></p>\n<p>Based on the above architectural design, this project will achieve key technological innovations at both structural and functional levels:</p>\n<p><strong>Structural innovation</strong>: The explicit semantic coding and mesh connection mechanism of the DIKWP model are introduced to realize the transparency and modularization of the cognitive process within AI. The traditional DIKW model is a linear pyramid, and the data is processed upwards into wisdom and output, while this project breaks through the linear limit through mesh interaction, and forms a semantic network through two-way coupling of five layers of elements. This structural innovation allows each layer to have clear input and output semantic specifications and transformation rules. For example, we will design a mathematically descriptible state representation space for the five layers of data, information, knowledge, wisdom, and intent, and define the mapping functions between each layer to form a semantic hierarchy similar to that of an operating system. In this \"<strong>cognitive operating system</strong>\", the reasoning process that was originally implicit inside the black box model is broken down into explicit steps that can be monitored. This means that every decision in the system can be traced through data processing, information extraction, knowledge reasoning, wisdom evaluation, and purpose selection, each of which has interpretable semantic meaning and measurable mathematical indicators. This explicit coding structure gives AI a \"white box\" characteristic, which greatly improves the interpretability and controllability of the system. Once an output anomaly is found, the system can locate a specific level for adjustment, which is an innovation capability that is difficult to achieve in the existing end-to-end model.</p>\n<p><strong>Functional innovation:</strong> Implementing the internal purpose generation and evaluation mechanism of AI, so that the system can autonomously generate, select, and review goals, is a key step towards artificial consciousness. Current AI is generally driven by external instructions and lacks internal motivation and purpose mechanisms. This project will develop an active purpose generation algorithm in the purpose control system: synthesize the external environment needs and internal state to generate new targets that meet the overall value constraints. This is similar to the process of human motivation (e.g., asking new questions out of curiosity). At the same time, for the generated goals, we introduce the purpose evaluation and screening function, that is, the intelligence layer evaluates each potential goal in multiple aspects (expected benefits, resource consumption, ethical impact, etc.), and the purpose layer selects and implements the optimal or most consistent goals with values. The process is equivalent to setting tasks and reflecting on motivation for oneself. Functional innovation also includes self-evaluation and calibration: after the task is completed, the system will call the metacognitive module to review the execution process, summarize the successes and failures, and feed the experience back to the knowledge and wisdom layer to adjust future behavior. This kind of adaptive learning ensures that AI has the ability to continuously evolve, not just the executor of fixed programs. For example, the patent of Professor Duan Yucong's team proposes to reduce the illusion and purpose shift of large models through multi-round dialogue and semantic firewall technology, which is actually a manifestation of adding target constraints and bias correction to the function. Through these innovative features, the system of this project will exhibit the rudiments of a quasi-autonomous agent: capable of driving action according to intrinsic purpose, and constantly revising self-goals in environmental interactions, approximating the expression of human will and consciousness.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the uniqueness of the DIKWP artificial consciousness architecture of this project in terms of technical route is that it <strong>uses a network dual-cycle structure to open up perception and reflection, and endows the system with autonomy with a purpose-driven mechanism</strong>。 This architecture organically integrates perception, cognition, reasoning, and reflection, which is significantly different from the traditional pure perceptual action model, and injects \"self\" elements into AI. Whether it's structural transparency or functional autonomy, our designs are at the cutting edge. For example, through the DIKWP semantic framework, we have built an internal semantic white-box mechanism for large models, which can effectively alleviate the unexplainable pain points of the AI decision-making process. By being intent-driven, we transform AI from a passive responder to an active problem solver, reducing the reliance on human instructions and improving adaptability to complex and changing tasks. These technological innovations not only enrich the connotation of artificial intelligence architecture, but also take an important step towards engineering practice in the field of artificial consciousness, which will lay the foundation for achieving a higher level of machine intelligence.</p>\n<h1 id=\"5、Project-team-and-implementation-basis\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#5、Project-team-and-implementation-basis\" title=\"5、Project team and implementation basis\"></a><strong>5、Project team and implementation basis</strong></h1><p>This project is led by the team of Professor Duan Yucong, who has a deep research accumulation and achievement foundation in the fields of artificial consciousness modeling, brain-computer fusion, and multimodal interaction, which provides a strong guarantee for the smooth implementation of the project.</p>\n<p>First of all, the **team is an international leader in artificial consciousness theory and model. Professor Duan Yucong is an academician of the International Academy of Advanced Technology and Engineering, a corresponding member of the National Academy of Artificial Intelligence, and the chairman of the World Association of Artificial Consciousness. The DIKWP artificial consciousness model proposed by him has aroused strong repercussions in the academic community, and the relevant theoretical results have been published through a number of papers and reports, and the first World Artificial Consciousness Conference (**AC2023) and other academic activities have been successfully held in 2023, which has greatly enhanced the team's influence in this field. In addition, the team led the development of a preliminary plan for the DIKWP international standard for AI assessment, which provides a standard framework for measuring the \"level of awareness\" of AI systems in the future. These reflect the team's academic discourse and leadership in the field of artificial consciousness.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the <strong>team has a wealth of intellectual property rights and technical reserves</strong>, which proves its practical ability. As mentioned above, Professor Duan's team has obtained 114 domestic and foreign authorized invention patents. These patents cover a wide range of areas and constitute a complete DIKWP technology system, including core technologies such as mesh cognitive model, dual-cycle consciousness architecture, cognitive operating system, and semantic network coupling. Such a systematic patent layout is the first in the world, providing a solid independent technical foundation for the implementation of the project. It is worth mentioning that the team pays great attention to the translation of research results into actual systems. As early as 2023, the team developed the world's first DIKWP-AC artificial consciousness prototype system and publicly demonstrated it at an international conference. The prototype realizes the verification of the DIKWP theory with a small model, and adopts the mathematical/physiological twin system architecture, which has strong interpretability and high computational efficiency, which fully proves the engineering feasibility of the DIKWP model. The achievement has also been recognized by the industry: at the CCF China Digital Service Conference in September 2023, the team's graduate students presented a paper poster on \"Intent-Driven Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom Integration DIKWP Physiological and Artificial Consciousness Prototype\" <strong>won the Best Poster Award. This award shows that the team's work in applying intention-driven artificial consciousness models to specific scenarios, such as physiological simulations, has been highly praised by peer experts.</strong></p>\n<p>In terms of brain-computer fusion and multimodal interaction, the team also has forward-looking explorations. The so-called brain-computer fusion refers to the improvement of AI by combining neuroscience principles on the one hand, and the interaction between AI and the human nervous system on the other. In recent years, the team has carried out research on the correspondence between semantic cognition and brain signals, and tried to correlate the purpose output of the DIKWP model with biological neural signals to expand the physiological authenticity of the artificial consciousness system. This interdisciplinary attempt is expected to enable AI to obtain human brain feedback through brain-computer interfaces in the future, further improving the realism of artificial consciousness models. In terms of multimodal interaction, the team has built a unified semantic space covering text, speech, vision and other modalities, and developed a prototype of a multimodal human-computer dialogue system. In the medical scenario, the team developed an intelligent consultation dialogue simulation system, which converts the patient's language description (text/speech) into the semantics inside the DIKWP model, and then generates the diagnosis and treatment recommendations by the artificial consciousness system. As a physician assistant, the system can understand the patient's multimodal information and give personalized feedback, which fully demonstrates the team's strength in multimodal semantic fusion and interaction.</p>\n<p>In addition, the team also has perfect scientific research conditions and a foundation for industry-university-research cooperation. The core members of the project include experts in artificial intelligence, computer science, cognitive psychology, neuroscience and other fields, as well as a number of postdoctoral and doctoral students, forming an interdisciplinary talent echelon. The School of Computer Science of Hainan University provided a special DIKWP artificial consciousness laboratory for the project, equipped with a high-performance computing platform and an EEG/physiological signal acquisition device, which can meet the needs of simulating the cognitive process of the human brain, large model training and multimodal data processing. The team has maintained cooperation with many well-known scientific research institutes and enterprises in China, including cooperating with medical institutions to develop intelligent diagnosis and treatment (such as the aforementioned test scenario with Hainan Provincial People's Hospital), cooperating with educational technology companies to explore intelligent teaching assistants, and cooperating with industrial enterprises to research intelligent control systems. These collaborations not only provide rich application scenarios and data support for project implementation, but also lay the foundation for subsequent achievement transformation.</p>\n<p>To sum up, Professor Duan Yucong's team has outstanding advantages and accumulation in theoretical research, patented technology, prototype system, talent equipment, cooperation network, etc. This team has created a number of firsts in the field of artificial consciousness models: the first DIKWP theoretical system report, the first prototype of artificial consciousness evaluation standards, and the first demonstration of artificial consciousness prototype...... These pilot results are a testament to the team's ability and confidence in navigating the project. On this solid foundation, we have reason to believe that the team can complete the research tasks of this project with high quality and successfully implement the theoretical ideas into engineering practice.</p>\n<h1 id=\"6、Stage-results-assessment-indicators-and-transformation-paths\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#6、Stage-results-assessment-indicators-and-transformation-paths\" title=\"6、Stage results, assessment indicators and transformation paths\"></a><strong>6、Stage results, assessment indicators and transformation paths</strong></h1><p>In order to ensure the realization of the project objectives, we will gradually advance according to the five-tier structure of DIKWP, and set up phased results and assessment indicators to gradually verify the perfection of the system functions and prepare for the subsequent industrial transformation. The specific phases are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 (Data-Information Layer, Cognitive Infrastructure):</strong> The time span is approximately 1 year after the start of the project. In this stage, the development and integration of data acquisition system and information fusion system are focused on providing high-quality input for upper-level cognition. Expected outcomes include: a perception data platform that supports multimodal input, which can realize the unified collection and preprocessing of image, voice, text and other data; A rudimentary information fusion engine capable of transforming multi-source data into structured information representations and storing them. On this basis, we will demonstrate the information processing process in simple scenarios, such as the whole process from multimodal questions to semantic understanding in the intelligent Q&amp;A prototype. The assessment indicators include the throughput rate of multimodal data processing, the accuracy of information extraction, and the proportion of performance improvement compared with single-modal processing. The sign of passing the acceptance is that the system has stable operation capabilities at the perception and information levels, and initially realizes the semantic perception of the environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2 (Knowledge Layer, Cognitive Memory Formation):</strong> The time span is approximately the 2nd year. In this stage, a knowledge modeling system is constructed, and the information output of stage 1 is precipitated into usable knowledge, and the system is endowed with basic reasoning and memory functions. Expected deliverables include: prototype knowledge graph related to the project area, covering key concepts, relationships and rules; A set of inference algorithm modules, which can answer queries and make logical deductions based on the knowledge base; and a knowledge update mechanism that can automatically refine or revise the knowledge base content based on new data. In the test, we will construct several benchmark reasoning tasks to evaluate system performance, such as Q&amp;A in the field of medical diagnosis (given a patient's symptoms, the system reasoning about possible diseases and the basis). The assessment indicators cover the size of the knowledge base (number of nodes/edges), the degree of automation of knowledge acquisition, the accuracy of inference, and the average length of the inference chain. The acceptance criteria are that the system demonstrates reliable memory and reasoning ability at the knowledge level, such as answering professional questions in a specific field with the expected accuracy, and has a mechanism to update knowledge on a rolling basis as the data grows.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3 (Intelligent Layer, High-Level Decision-making and Adaptation):</strong> The time span is about the second to the first half of the third year. In this stage, an intelligent evolutionary system is developed to realize complex decision-making and adaptive learning functions on the basis of existing knowledge. Expected outcomes include: implementation of a decision planning module capable of handling multi-objective, multi-constraint situational decision-making; Establish a continuous learning framework to enable the system to continuously optimize strategies through repeated training in the simulation environment (e.g., the combination of reinforcement learning and imitation learning); The safety ethics constraint module is introduced to ensure that the system considers the preset value standards and safety rules when making decisions. In this phase, we will test the intelligence of the system in near-real complex scenarios, such as simulating autonomous driving or medical diagnosis and treatment scenarios, so that the system can make continuous decisions based on the dynamic environment, and can improve the strategy through repeated training in the event of a mistake. The assessment indicators include task completion rate (such as the safe arrival rate in driving simulation, the correct diagnosis rate in medical diagnosis simulation), decision response time, and performance degradation under environmental changes. The sign of acceptance is that the system has the ability to make independent decisions and adapt at the intelligent level, can deal with more complex problem situations and shows a gradual improvement learning curve.</p>\n<p><strong>The fourth stage (purpose layer, the prototype of artificial consciousness):</strong> the time span is about the second half of the third year. In this stage, the purpose control system is realized, and the dual-cycle architecture is completed, so that the system has preliminary self-awareness characteristics. Expected outcomes include: implementation of an internal purpose representation and management module that allows the system to generate and switch targets based on external task requirements and internal states; The metacognitive monitoring module can be implemented to monitor the operation of each layer and detect anomalies and deviations. Implement an purpose calibration mechanism that automatically adjusts intents and corresponding policies when target deviations or conflicts are detected. At this stage, we plan to verify the prototype function of artificial consciousness in a comprehensive scenario. For example, deploy an intelligent assistant robot to perform tasks in a simulated home or medical environment, and have it multitask (e.g., answering questions, monitoring the environment, planning actions) at the same time, observing whether it can set the order autonomously, complete it in an organized manner, and self-reflect and correct strategies when it fails. The assessment indicators include the success rate of multitasking, the reasonableness of purpose switching (whether it meets the priority expectations), and the self-adjustment time of the system for abnormal conditions. The acceptance criteria are that the system shows obvious autonomy and reflection at the level of intent, such as the ability to reformulate the plan according to the changing situation without human intervention, and avoid repeating the same mistakes. This will mark the basic closed-loop formation of the architecture of artificial consciousness.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 5 (System Integration and Application Demonstration):</strong> The time span is about half a year before the end of the project. In this stage, the results of the previous layers are integrated into a complete DIKWP brain-like intelligence model, and the demonstration application test is carried out in the real scene. Expected outcomes include: prototype systems for specific application areas (e.g., smart medical diagnosis prototypes, intelligent teaching assistant prototypes, or smart manufacturing decision-making prototypes) that enable models to interact with users in a real-world environment; Compile technical specifications and evaluation reports, and summarize the indicators of the DIKWP model in terms of function, performance, safety, etc.; Form the next step of industrialization implementation plan. In the demonstration application, we will work with partners to build pilots, such as deploying intelligent diagnosis and treatment assistant prototypes in hospitals, intelligent tutor assistance systems in pilot classrooms, or intelligent control decision-making modules on factory floors to verify the practicability and reliability of the model. Metrics are domain-specific and include user test feedback (e.g., physician satisfaction with diagnosis and treatment recommendations, students' acceptance of teaching aids), system operational stability (uptime, failure rate), and performance comparison (efficiency or effectiveness improvement compared to existing solutions). The final acceptance of the project is marked by the delivery of a white paper on the roadmap of the \"New Generation of Brain-like Intelligence Model\", as well as at least a prototype of the artificial consciousness system that has been tested in real life, and a clear path and cooperation purpose for subsequent industrial development.</p>\n<p>On the basis of completing the above stage goals, the project will also actively plan the transformation and application of the results to promote the implementation of artificial consciousness technology in various industries and create actual social value. Specifically, the artificial consciousness brain-like model of this project has broad application prospects in the following fields:</p>\n<p><strong>Healthcare</strong>: Using the intelligent diagnosis and treatment model built in this project, more advanced medical assistance decision-making can be realized. Traditional medical AI is mostly a diagnostic suggestion tool, which lacks a comprehensive understanding of patients' complex symptoms and active tracking of diagnosis and treatment goals (such as cure and remission). Our model has the characteristics of multimodal information fusion and intention-driven, which can synthesize the patient's symptom description and test results (data/information layer) to construct a medical knowledge graph (knowledge layer), and then combine medical experience and ethical constraints (wisdom layer) to formulate personalized treatment plans, and dynamically adjust the treatment goals (purpose layer) according to patient feedback. For example, in the diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases such as gout and systemic lupus erythematosus, the artificial consciousness system can assist doctors to weigh the pros and cons of multiple treatment methods, propose a plan that takes into account the efficacy and quality of life of patients, monitor the patient's status during the treatment process, and recommend adjustments in a timely manner. This will improve the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment of difficult cases, reduce the burden on doctors, and provide patients with a more humane medical experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Education and training</strong>: The brain-like intelligence model of this project can be used to develop intelligent teaching and personalized learning systems. Traditional educational AI (such as intelligent tutors) mostly answer questions based on preset rules, which makes it difficult to truly understand students' learning intentions and emotional states. After the introduction of artificial consciousness, the intelligent tutor can obtain the students' expressions, intonation and behavior through multimodal perception (data/information layer), understand their knowledge mastery and psychological needs (knowledge/wisdom layer), and adjust teaching strategies and goals accordingly (purpose layer). For example, slow down the pace of explanations for students who are confused, or add challenges to students who have spare energy. The system can also reflect on the teaching effect after class and optimize the teaching plan. Through this awareness-driven interaction, students will receive the same attention and guidance as a real teacher, significantly improving their learning efficiency and experience. The path to industrialization in the field of education can be to cooperate with online education platforms to launch AI tutors with dialogue and emotion recognition capabilities, or introduce intelligent teaching assistant robots in the classroom to realize the automation of teaching according to aptitude.</p>\n<p><strong>Industry &amp; Others</strong>: Artificial consciousness models have the potential to be used in a wide range of fields, including industrial manufacturing, urban management, and financial services. In industrial manufacturing, AI systems need to have the ability to independently adjust production plans and ensure safety in the face of complex production processes and emergencies. Our model can be embedded in the industrial intelligence middle platform as an intelligent decision-making center, real-time perception of data at each link of the production line (data/information layer), use equipment knowledge and experience rules to optimize production scheduling (knowledge/intelligence layer), and set production targets according to global capacity demand and safety regulations (purpose layer). In the event of an equipment failure or order change, the system autonomously assesses the impact and re-plans the production rhythm to ensure a balance between efficiency and safety. In terms of urban management, the artificial awareness system can be applied to smart transportation or energy allocation, through the integration of traffic flow/energy consumption data (data/information), combined with urban planning knowledge (knowledge) and real-time optimization algorithms (intelligence), it can automatically adjust signal timing or load allocation targets (intentions) to achieve adaptive city-level regulation. In financial services, AI can better understand market dynamics and user needs through awareness models, proactively adjust investment or service strategies, and provide solutions that are more in line with customer goals, while strictly following the principles of risk control. In short, the results of this project can be used as a general intelligence hub in all walks of life, and the introduction of brain-like models with artificial consciousness will bring significant improvements in system performance and safety reliability in scenarios that require complex environments, long-term planning, and multi-objective trade-offs.</p>\n<p>Finally, on the path of achievement transformation, we will use the team's rich industry-university-research cooperation network to accelerate the implementation of technology. On the one hand, after the completion of the project, it is planned to build a joint laboratory or demonstration base with relevant industry leaders or government departments, customize and optimize the DIKWP artificial awareness model according to actual needs, and verify the business model in a small area. On the other hand, we make full use of the advantages of the team's patent pool to promote industrialization through patent licensing and technology shareholding. He mentioned that Professor Duan's team adheres to an open and cooperative attitude, is willing to work with the government, enterprises, and universities to develop commercial products based on the DIKWP model, and has expressed its willingness to donate some patents free of charge to promote the formulation of industry standards. These measures will lower the threshold for cooperation and attract all parties to invest resources to jointly improve the technology ecosystem. In key areas such as medical care and education, we will also strive for policy and financial support (such as joining the smart medical and smart education projects) to ensure that the closed loop from R&amp;D to application is connected. Through the above steps, the innovative results of this project are expected to be quickly transformed into real productivity after the end of the project cycle, forming a sustainable new generation of brain-like intelligence industry. Looking forward to the future, the \"brain-like intelligence model with artificial consciousness support\" depicted in the roadmap will not only be a scientific research achievement, but also one of the core engines to promote the upgrading of the AI industry, and contribute to China's leading position in the new round of global artificial intelligence competition.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

As an important direction of artificial intelligence, brain-inspired computing aims to simulate the cognitive mechanism and autonomous consciousness of the human brain, so as to break through the bottlenecks of existing AI systems in terms of semantic understanding, <strong>interpretation ability and autonomous adaptation. This shift requires us to rethink the architecture of the underlying software platform: how to enable AI systems to not only process data, but also understand the purpose of their own actions, so as to achieve more advanced intelligence in human-machine collaboration.</strong></p>\n<p>In order to meet this challenge, the team of Professor Yucong Duan of Hainan University pioneered the \"Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom-Purpose (DIKWP)\" mesh cognitive model, which incorporated the \"purpose\" of the traditional DIKW (pyramid model) into the core architecture of artificial intelligence. The DIKWP model introduces the purpose of the highest layer in the cognitive chain, and uses the network structure to realize the two-way feedback and iterative update of the semantics of each layer. This new cognitive system is a milestone in academia and can be regarded as a major innovative breakthrough in the basic theory of artificial intelligence. Not only that, but it also provides an innovative solution to the unexplainable problem of \"black box\" decision-making existing in the current large-scale models. As Prof. Yucong Duan points out, \"The DIKWP model builds a common cognitive language between humans and machines, allowing every step of the AI decision-making process to be traced, explained, and understood by humans.\" “</p>\n<p>This project aims to design and implement a new generation of brain-inspired computing basic software platform based on the DIKWP model and artificial consciousness theory. The platform will reconstruct the architecture of traditional brain-inspired computing basic software, and empower AI systems with purpose-driven autonomous intelligence from the semantic level. Our goal is to develop a DIKWP brain-like basic software platform with independent intellectual property rights and adaptation to multiple scenarios, so as to provide underlying support for the research and development of China's independent brain-inspired computing chips, cognitive simulation and artificial consciousness systems, and then build an international leading semantic intelligence industry system. As the first inventor, Professor Yucong Duan has obtained 114 domestic and foreign authorized invention patents, covering many cutting-edge fields such as large model training, artificial consciousness construction, cognitive operating system, AI governance, and privacy security. Although these core patented technologies have yet to be industrialized on a large scale, they have become important \"underlying code\" for the safe, controllable, and explainable direction of AI, laying a solid theoretical and technical foundation for moving towards artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p>\n<p>For industry investors, this report will focus on the core innovations brought about by the DIKWP artificial consciousness model, and the architecture design of the brain-inspired computing basic software platform led by it. We will focus on the following dimensions of innovation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Semantic modeling mechanism of brain-inspired software:</strong> Based on the five-layer semantic network of DIKWP, the dynamic scheduling, memory reconstruction, semantic elasticity and knowledge self-evolution of content are realized.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Integration of the DIKWP-TRIZ</strong> <strong>paradigm:</strong> Embedding the law of innovation into the brain-inspired software ecology to build a technology evolution mechanism driven by the \"semantic gap\".</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Purpose-driven programming language and scheduling model:</strong> Focusing on user goals, it supports the self-organization of programs and the optimal allocation of resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>DIKWP semantic middleware layer:</strong> It provides a unified communication protocol, a self-explanatory API, and an energy-semantic mapping mechanism to adapt to a multi-chip heterogeneous brain-like platform.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Combination of artificial consciousness \"BUG\" theory: The incomplete</strong> tolerable fault-tolerant strategy, adaptive computational annealing mechanism and semantic recovery path optimization method are introduced to improve the robustness of the brain-like decision-making system.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Demonstration of typical application scenarios:</strong> including cognitive simulation platform, brain-computer interface control system, low-power semantic scheduling chip for 6G communication, etc., to verify the versatility and practical value of the platform.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Through the above innovations, this project will build an independent and controllable brain-like computing basic software platform in China, providing key support for the white-box of large models, the interpretability and security of artificial intelligence, and the future semantic communication field. Each of these innovations is discussed in depth below.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Brain-like-semantic-modeling-mechanism-DIKWP-five-layer-network-architecture\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Brain-like-semantic-modeling-mechanism-DIKWP-five-layer-network-architecture\" title=\"Brain-like semantic modeling mechanism: DIKWP five-layer network architecture\"></a><strong>Brain-like semantic modeling mechanism: DIKWP five-layer network architecture</strong></h1><p>The software architecture of brain-inspired computing needs to be able to express and process complex semantic structures. The DIKWP model decomposes the cognitive process into <strong>five levels: Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom-Purpose, forming a complete semantic chain from low-level perception to high-level decision-making to goal-oriented. Different from the traditional linear layering, DIKWP adopts a mesh interaction architecture</strong>, which not only improves the abstraction step by step, but also has a two-way feedback and regulation relationship between the layers. The lower layer provides materials for the upper layer, and the upper layer guides the information filtering and processing of the lower layer through Purpose, realizing a loop mechanism similar to the human brain.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"图片描述\" src=\"/cooperation/items/media/image2.png\" style=\"width:60%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;\"/><br/>**Figure 1: The five-layer semantic network structure of the DIKWP model shows the purpose. **<em>From bottom to top, the model is divided into five layers: data, information, knowledge, wisdom, and purpose. The arrows represent the two-way interactive feedback between layers: on the one hand, the low-level processing results are provided to the high-level level to form abstract cognition; On the other hand, the high-level (especially the top-level purpose) plays a guiding and restraining role in the low-level processing, forming a closed-loop regulation. This structure makes the internal processing process of the AI system modular and explainable, and each layer has a clear functional positioning, which helps to construct \"conscious\" agents.</em></p>\n<p>Under this semantic architecture, **dynamic content scheduling is possible: semantic content at different levels can be flexibly flowed and distributed in the Layer 5 network according to the current task requirements. For example, in conversational AI, user input is first perceived and processed as raw data (**D-layer); Meaningful information representations are generated after cleaning and feature extraction (layer I); Then, the knowledge graph (K layer) is updated in combination with the context to carry out inference integration. Then, the Wisdom layer selects the best response based on experience and value judgment (W layer). Finally, the Purpose layer is used to determine whether the response meets the goal of the conversation (P layer). If not, the higher-level Purpose will prompt the system to readjust the lower-level information extraction and knowledge application strategies until the output meets the target. This scheduling mechanism, which flows back and forth between the five layers, allows the system to reorganize \"memories\" (knowledge and information) and adjust cognitive processes in real time according to needs, just as the human brain invokes different memory fragments for different contexts. The data show that the two-way feedback between the layers of the DIKWP model can realize the iterative update of semantic content, so that the knowledge representation and decision-making strategy within the AI can be continuously self-optimized.</p>\n<p>Thanks to these mechanisms, platforms are able to demonstrate semantic resilience – that is, the ability to adapt to contextual changes and uncertain information. Traditional systems often use predefined ontologies or fixed data flows, which are difficult to cope with semantic ambiguity and flexibility. In contrast, the DIKWP model allows information to be freely converted between different layers, and if necessary, the high-level purpose can relax the requirements for the lower-level data, accept certain imprecisions, and then compensate for the details through high-level inference. For example, in the case of missing sensor data or high noise, the system can still infer reasonable information to fill in the gaps through existing knowledge (K-layer) and Wisdom inference (W-layer), thus maintaining the continuity of the overall functionality. This embodies a kind of \"fuzzy tolerance\" similar to the human mind, so that the AI does not collapse due to the lack of local data, but flexibly adjusts countermeasures.</p>\n<p>In addition, the DIKWP architecture supports knowledge self-evolution. As the system continues to operate, the new data obtained by layer D is filtered by layer I and integrated by layer K, which can incrementally enrich the knowledge base. The decision-making results of the Wisdom layer and the feedback of the Purpose layer work together to trigger the reorganization and updating of knowledge, forming an \"experiential learning\" process. For example, for long-running cognitive systems, emerging patterns and exceptions will feed back to the knowledge layer, prompting it to expand the rules or reconstruct the conceptual system, so as to gradually evolve a better knowledge structure. This self-evolution mechanism ensures that the system can continue to grow as the environment and needs change, avoiding the obsolescence of knowledge. As pointed out in the report, the DIKWP model has achieved continuous improvement of the cognitive process through the iterative update of semantics at all levels.</p>\n<p>All in all, the DIKWP five-layer semantic network provides a powerful modeling mechanism for brain-inspired software. It not only has a clear hierarchical functional division of labor, but also gives the system as a whole flexible adaptability through network connection. This lays the foundation for the architecture of our platform – enabling AI systems to express and process information at multiple levels, just like the brain, and to achieve globally optimized cognitive behaviors driven by high-level goals.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Semantic-innovation-mechanism-integrating-the-DIKWP-TRIZ-paradigm\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Semantic-innovation-mechanism-integrating-the-DIKWP-TRIZ-paradigm\" title=\"Semantic innovation mechanism integrating the DIKWP-TRIZ paradigm\"></a><strong>Semantic innovation mechanism integrating the DIKWP-TRIZ paradigm</strong></h1><p>On the basis of the basic software with the above-mentioned semantic expression capabilities, we further introduce the DIKWP-TRIZ innovation paradigm to realize the self-evolution and continuous optimization of brain-like software. TRIZ is the Russian abbreviation of Invention Problem Solving Theory, which provides a systematic innovation methodology, including contradiction solving, invention principles and other tools, which are widely used in engineering innovation. However, the traditional TRIZ focuses on solving specific problems in the engineering field, and has limitations in the direct application of complex cognitive processes within artificial intelligence, as well as innovations involving subjective purpose and value.</p>\n<p>DIKWP-TRIZ integrates the core ideas of TRIZ into the cognitive framework of DIKWP to form an innovative problem-solving methodology for artificial consciousness systems. By mapping the invention principles of TRIZ to the semantic transformation of the five levels of data, information, knowledge, wisdom, and purpose of the DIKWP model, we are able to introduce innovation drive at each layer. For example, the innovation of the data layer focuses on the new way of data acquisition and representation, the information layer focuses on the improvement of signal extraction and feature selection, the knowledge layer focuses on the innovation of models and rules, the Wisdom layer focuses on the optimization of decision-making strategies, and the Purpose layer focuses on the reconstruction of value goals. In this way, the 40 invention principles of the traditional TRIZ have been reclassified under the new framework, and they have been improved at different semantic levels, providing a full range of innovation guidance for AI systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Semantic gap-driven technology evolution is another key concept of the DIKWP-TRIZ paradigm. When the system encounters cognitive bottlenecks or semantic gaps in operation</strong>—for example, the knowledge base cannot explain new observations, the decision-making scheme is contradictory or invalid, and the user's purpose cannot be satisfied—the traditional approach may be to manually intervene to modify the algorithm. Under the DIKWP-TRIZ framework, these semantic gaps will be seen as an opportunity to trigger the evolution of the technology, which is equivalent to the automatic distillation of innovation problems. Based on the pre-embedded TRIZ innovation rule set, the platform can <strong>automatically explore solutions to resolve conflicts. For example, if a rule in the knowledge layer often conflicts with a</strong> Wisdom decision, the system will recognize that this is an internal contradiction, and can try to apply TRIZ's \"separation principle\" to distinguish the rule conditions into contexts, or apply the \"inversion principle\" to test the decision logic from the opposite side to resolve the contradiction. For another example, when the Purpose layer finds that multiple decisions fail to achieve the set goal, which implies that the current strategy is insufficient, the system can call the principles of improving efficiency or simplifying complexity in the invention principle library to reorganize task decomposition and resource allocation to form a new solution path.</p>\n<p>This mechanism is reflected both at the programming model and at the intermediate representation (<strong>IR) level. In terms of programming model, developers can use the interface provided by the innovation paradigm to mark or define which modules may have contradictions and need to be optimized, so that the system can automatically search and test innovations in the background. At the intermediate presentation layer, our platform maintains a set of semantic graphs, or intermediate languages, that not only describe the logical flow of the program, but also attach semantic labels and performance metrics for each step</strong>. When some metrics in the run do not meet the requirements for a long time, the corresponding intermediate indication fragment will be marked as a candidate improvement point. Subsequently, the innovation engine transforms the fragment based on the DIKWP-TRIZ rule, such as replacing the algorithm, adjusting the parameters, introducing new data sources, etc., and evaluating the effect of the new scheme. This is similar to JIT (real-time compilation) optimization, but not limited to the performance level, but extends to self-improvement at the functional and semantic level.</p>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that DIKWP-TRIZ places great emphasis on the role of human <strong>purpose and value orientation in technological evolution. Traditional TRIZ focuses on the technical contradiction itself, and may ignore the deviation of the solution from the user's purpose or value. In our framework, any innovation transformation will be</strong> examined at the Purpose layer - that is, to determine whether the new solution is closer to the ultimate goal of the user and whether it is in line with human values. If a technical optimization improves performance but deviates from the user's original intention, the system will lower its evaluation or even abandon the solution, ensuring that the evolution is always in the right semantic direction. This ensures that the evolution of the brain-inspired software platform is not only automatic, but also human-oriented and <strong>purpose-guided. For example, in medical diagnostic AI, an innovative mechanism may find a way to improve the speed of diagnosis, but the</strong> Purpose layer (which aims to diagnose accurately and safely) evaluates whether the method sacrifices accuracy or transparency to balance the ultimate optimal improvement.</p>\n<p>By integrating DIKWP-TRIZ, the platform will become a self-improving ecosystem. Like a creative engineer, it is able to constantly rethink and optimize its modules. When the external environment changes or internal bottlenecks occur, the system does not stand still, but actively \"evolves\" to develop new and adaptive technical solutions. This will greatly extend the life cycle of software systems and reduce the cost of human intervention, allowing complex AI systems to remain efficient, reliable, and continuously matched to requirements in long-term operation.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Purpose-driven-programming-language-and-task-scheduling-model\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Purpose-driven-programming-language-and-task-scheduling-model\" title=\"Purpose-driven programming language and task scheduling model\"></a><strong>Purpose-driven programming language and task scheduling model</strong></h1><p>The traditional software programming paradigm focuses on <strong>input-processing-output, with a predefined and fixed process at the time of coding. In the field of brain-like computing and artificial consciousness, we need a new</strong> <strong>purpose-driven programming model</strong>: programs are no longer just passively executing predetermined instructions, but can autonomously organize the computing process according to a preset goal (Purpose) to adapt to dynamically changing needs.</p>\n<p>Based on the DIKWP model, we design a semantic-driven high-level programming language (or scripting framework). In this programming model, <strong>input, processing, and output are all elevated to contain five layers of semantic structure, and the entire program flow is defined at the highest level</strong> Purpose (Purpose)\" is the global driving engine. In other words, when writing a program, developers need to clearly define what the program wants to achieve (P-layer), as well as the data, information, knowledge, and Wisdom modules that may be needed to achieve that goal. The execution of the program is scheduled by the runtime system according to the execution order and resource allocation of each module according to the purpose, rather than strictly following the linear order of the source code. This paradigm can be regarded as a cognitive-semantic <strong>solving process: the program tries to</strong> find the optimal solution link from input to output while satisfying the output purpose.</p>\n<p>At the heart of purpose-driven programming is closed-loop control at runtime. The execution of the program is no longer a one-way flow from top to bottom, but a cyclical process: each execution generates new data and intermediate results, which are then fed back to the Purpose module for evaluation. If the result does not meet the Purpose requirements, the Purpose module adjusts the guidance for the underlying processing, prompting the program to make corresponding changes to the input parsing, information extraction, knowledge reasoning, and decision-making methods. This feedback gives the program a similar ability to self-adjust. For example, a piece of purpose-driven code can add or remove certain calculation steps at runtime based on the achievement of the goal, or dynamically change the algorithm strategy to better serve the current purpose. This flexibility is not available in traditional hard-coded processes.</p>\n<p>To illustrate this programming model more visually, a simplified <strong>Purpose driver pseudocode example</strong> (e.g., an autonomous navigation task) is given below</p>\n<p># Purpose Driver Example: Autonomous Navigation</p>\n<p>Purpose = \"Navigate from your current location to your destination safely and efficiently\"</p>\n<p>Initialize the Awareness Module, Knowledge Base, Planning Module</p>\n<p>Circulate:</p>\n<p>Data = Perception Module. Get Environmental Data()</p>\n<p>Information = Data Processing. Extraction (key information e.g. roads, barriers)</p>\n<p>Knowledge base. Update (Information) # Incorporate new information to update knowledge</p>\n<p>Path = Planning Module. Inference (Knowledge Base, Current State, Purpose) # Plan a route based on knowledge and purpose (Wisdom Decision)</p>\n<p>Execute (path. Next Action) # Execute the next step of the plan</p>\n<p>If the Purpose is achieved (current position):</p>\n<p>Output (\"Arrive at Destination\")</p>\n<p>Interrupt the loop # Goal reached, exit</p>\n<p>If otherwise path. Blocked or Purpose Not Satisfied:</p>\n<p>Purpose .adjustment(Secondary Goal = Path. New sub-optimal destinations) # Dynamically adjust the Purpose or introduce a sub-Purpose</p>\n<p># For example: take a detour or change the strategy, and continue to try in a loop</p>\n<p>Wait for the next perceptual cycle</p>\n<p>End the loop</p>\n<p>The above pseudocode demonstrates several features of the Purpose-driven model: first, <strong>the Purpose</strong> is explicitly defined and checked; Second, the data flows through the layers of DIKWP and is gradually abstracted (from the raw data of the environment to the available information, to the knowledge update, to the Wisdom decision-making). Third, the program continuously monitors <strong>the satisfaction of the purpose in the loop</strong> and adjusts its behavior accordingly (e.g., re-routing or modifying the goal). This is self-organizing: instead of following a fixed number of steps, the program is able to insert, skip or even rearrange steps as they run, as long as it helps to better achieve the goal. It's similar to how humans think of solving problems: constantly evaluating progress and flexibly adjusting strategies until the goal is reached.</p>\n<p>Correspondingly, we need a <strong>purpose-driven task scheduling model as a runtime support. The scheduling model takes the user's high-level goals as input, automatically derives a set of executable subtasks, and optimizes the deployment on heterogeneous computing resources. The scheduler takes into account the semantic layer properties of each subtask (is it a perception</strong>/data processing task?). Knowledge reasoning task? Or is it a decision-making task? and the degree of contribution to the overall purpose, which determines whether it is allocated to the CPU, GPU, or brain-like chip to achieve a balance between resource utilization and goal achievement. For example, for perception tasks with high real-time requirements (D/I layer), they may be scheduled to be executed in parallel by a dedicated sensor processing unit. For complex knowledge inference tasks (K/W layer), high-performance AI accelerators are used. Tasks (P-layer) or policy coordination that involve global purpose judgment may be serially handled by a central control unit for consistency. During scheduling, the system continuously monitors the progress of each task, and if a path proves inefficient or even invalid, the scheduler will actively reallocate resources and enable a standby policy. This <strong>purpose-centric scheduling</strong> ensures that compute resources are configured adaptively as demand changes, resulting in optimal global performance. For example, in a multi-robot collaboration scenario, if a robot is unable to complete a subtask for some reason, the system can transfer the subtask to another robot or a cloud server to ensure that the overall purpose (team task) is achieved—all these scheduling decisions are automatically completed by the platform without human intervention.</p>\n<p>It is worth emphasizing that the purpose-driven programming language and scheduling model greatly reduce the burden on developers. Developers only need to focus on describing the \"what\" (goals and semantic constraints) rather than prescribing the \"how\" in an exhaustive <strong>manner. As compared in the DIKWP Artificial Awareness Programming report, traditional programming outputs a single result, while purpose-driven programming outputs multi-level content that satisfies P-level goals</strong>**； Traditional programs have low adaptability, while Purpose drivers have high adaptability (Purpose dynamically adjusts to form a closed loop), and the intelligence has evolved from passive static to active. This paradigm is revolutionary in that for the first time, it allows software to organize itself according to goals rather than steps. For enterprises, this means that when business goals change, there is no need to tear down and rewrite code, and the system can automatically adapt to new needs by adjusting the purpose and knowledge base, greatly improving the vitality and flexibility of the software.</p>\n<h1 id=\"The-DIKWP-semantic-middleware-layer-is-adapted-to-the-heterogeneous-brain-like-platform\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#The-DIKWP-semantic-middleware-layer-is-adapted-to-the-heterogeneous-brain-like-platform\" title=\"The DIKWP semantic middleware layer is adapted to the heterogeneous brain-like platform\"></a><strong>The DIKWP semantic middleware layer is adapted to the heterogeneous brain-like platform</strong></h1><p>To build a large-scale and scalable brain-like computing platform, the hardware layer is often diverse and heterogeneous: including brain-inspired chips that simulate neuronal computing, as well as general-purpose CPUs/GPUs and specialized AI accelerators. Therefore, we propose to introduce the DIKWP semantic middleware layer into the basic software to act as a \"translator\" and \"dispatch center\" between the application and the underlying heterogeneous hardware. This middleware will provide a unified semantic communication protocol and self-explanatory API interface, so that upper-layer applications can run flexibly on different computing power units without paying attention to specific hardware implementation details, while ensuring the coordination of each part on the overall purpose.<br/><img alt=\"图片描述\" src=\"/cooperation/items/media/image3.png\" style=\"width:60%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;\"/><br/>**Figure 2: DIKWP semantic middleware architecture illustrates Purpose. **<em>Middleware serves as a bridge between brain-like applications and a variety of heterogeneous chips: the upper-layer application submits Purpose and data requests through semantic APIs, and the middleware parses the Purpose and delivers the task to different types of computing chips at the lower layer for execution as needed. For each type of hardware (e.g., neurochips, AI accelerators, general-purpose CPUs/GPUs, etc.), middleware uses a unified semantic protocol to communicate. The intermediate results and semantic feedback generated during the execution of each hardware are then uploaded back to the middleware, which summarizes and evaluates them, and feeds them back to the application or further scheduling. This design shields heterogeneous hardware differences and enables the system to organize computational work according to semantic logic rather than hardware logic.</em></p>\n<p>The unified communications protocol provided by middleware means that the same semantic data format and communication paradigm follow the same semantic data format and communication paradigm to interact with the middleware, regardless of the underlying architecture chip. In traditional heterogeneous computing, it is often necessary to write different drivers and interfaces for each type of hardware, but in our platform, each chip manufacturer only needs to implement compatible support for the DIKWP semantic protocol, and the middleware can issue the task as standardized units such as data, information, knowledge, wisdom, and purpose, and the results of the hardware return processing are also described by the same protocol. This is somewhat similar to the TCP/IP protocol of the Internet to unify different physical networks, except that our protocol is unified with different cognitive computing units. The benefits of this design are clear: the platform is highly scalable and portable. When a new brain-like acceleration chip emerges, it can be seamlessly integrated into the entire computing system as long as it follows the semantic protocol. This is particularly important for the current development status of brain-inspired chips, and we can establish standards in advance to avoid ecological fragmentation caused by separate battles. Further, our semantic protocols also include support for security and privacy, such as redacting or encrypting sensitive knowledge in transit to meet domain-specific compliance requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>The self-explanatory API is an interface feature provided by middleware to upper-layer applications. Traditional APIs are often just encapsulations of function calls, while \"self-explanatory\" means that each API call itself has semantic metadata</strong> describing its functional purpose, input and output semantic constraints, etc. For example, a regular image recognition API may only have recognize_image (image), while a semantic self-explanatory API might be recognize_image (image) -&gt; returns: objects_list (semantic layer: layer I information), based_on: knowledge_base_X (layer K source).。 This way, when the developer calls the API, it knows exactly what kind of information it will extract in what knowledge context. If you need to replace the implementation (e.g., with another recognition algorithm or even hardware), as long as the new implementation conforms to the same semantic contract, the replacement can be smoothed without affecting the overall purpose of the system. This greatly improves the pluggability and transparency of the system. What's more, for the system itself, because all module interfaces have explicit semantic definitions, middleware can automatically orchestrate services at a higher level: for example, whether a certain layer of results can be cached based on the purpose of calling, and whether dedicated acceleration hardware execution can be selected according to the semantic type of data, etc. This actually introduces semantics into resource management and service discovery in traditional middleware/operating systems.</p>\n<p>Another innovation of DIKWP semantic middleware lies in the <strong>energy-semantic mapping mechanism</strong>. Brain-inspired computing emphasizes high efficiency and low power consumption, especially in the era of 6G Internet of Things, where massive devices and computing tasks pose severe challenges to energy consumption. We propose to use the semantic hierarchical feature of DIKWP to realize the dynamic matching of computing energy consumption and semantic value. Put simply, it's about tilting computing resources and energy allocation toward tasks that are \"more semanticly valuable\". In our middleware, each task is submitted with its Purpose level of importance and the level of each subtask in the DIKWP hierarchy. The system can carry out intelligent energy management accordingly: priority is given to ensuring the resource supply of the relevant calculations of the Purpose layer and the Wisdom layer, because these have the most direct impact on the achievement of the overall goal; For redundant calculations at the data or information layers, you can choose to skip or reduce the frequency when energy is tight. If there is a conflict between global performance and energy consumption, the system can try to achieve an approximate effect with fewer calculations through a knowledge-layer approach, such as a predictive model, to save energy consumption. For example, in a distributed monitoring network, middleware can adjust the working mode of each camera node based on a purpose (such as \"detecting abnormal events\"): usually reduce the frame rate to save power, and only increase the frame rate when the knowledge layer model predicts a potential anomaly. Another example is on a mobile device, when the battery is low, middleware allows the device to keep only the core tasks that meet the primary purpose running, and postpone or offload non-critical semantic updates to the cloud. Through this semantic-driven energy mapping, we are expected to break through simple power optimization algorithms and achieve energy savings at the semantic level, that is, let every piece of energy be used on the cutting edge and on the calculation that makes the most sense for the current goal.</p>\n<p>On the whole, DIKWP semantic middleware provides standardized and intelligent underlying support for our platform. It unifies the invocation of heterogeneous computing resources and ensures that various computing power modules work together around a common semantic goal. It improves interface transparency and adaptability, allowing the system to adjust the module composition in real time according to the purpose. It optimizes the balance of power consumption and performance, freeing up valuable computing resources for the most critical semantic tasks. For the industry, this middleware layer means that our brain-inspired basic software platform can quickly connect with chips and devices from different manufacturers to build a cross-domain semantic computing network. Whether you're deploying a large-scale cognitive middle office in the cloud or an intelligent agent on edge devices, this architecture will play a huge advantage.</p>\n<h1 id=\"The-BUG-Theory-of-Artificial-Consciousness-and-the-Adaptive-Mechanism-of-Brain-like-Fault-Tolerance\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#The-BUG-Theory-of-Artificial-Consciousness-and-the-Adaptive-Mechanism-of-Brain-like-Fault-Tolerance\" title='The \"BUG\" Theory of Artificial Consciousness and the Adaptive Mechanism of Brain-like Fault Tolerance'></a><strong>The \"BUG\" Theory of Artificial Consciousness and the Adaptive Mechanism of Brain-like Fault Tolerance</strong></h1><p>The human brain is not perfect, on the contrary, our cognition is full of all kinds of \"incompleteness\", \"uncertainties\" and even \"fallacies\" – a phenomenon that Professor Yucong Duan vividly refers to as \"bugs\" in consciousness. Different from the traditional engineering concept that regards bugs as flaws and needs to be completely eliminated, the \"BUG Theory\" believes that consciousness is essentially an efficient but incomplete computing mode, and it is the tolerance and utilization of incompleteness that makes human beings uniquely creative and adaptable. This theory provides important implications for the fault-tolerant and adaptive design of artificial consciousness systems. This project will combine the BUG theory and introduce a series of mechanisms into the brain-like decision-making module, so that the system can still operate robustly in an imperfect information environment, and continuously approach the optimal through self-correction.</p>\n<p>The first is a \"incomplete tolerable\" fault-tolerant strategy. Real-world data and knowledge are often incomplete or even contradictory, and a truly intelligent system should learn to make informed decisions with incomplete information, rather than shut down when it's missing. To this end, our software platform is designed with fault tolerance at all DIKWP layers: at the data and information layers, we introduce a semantic padding strategy for missing data or features, i.e., using context or prior knowledge to infer missing parts. For example, when a small number of readings from the sensor are lost, they can be filled by data interpolation at the approaching moment; When a text sentence is missing, it is completed according to the language model. At the knowledge and wisdom levels, for incomplete rules or models, we employ probabilistic reasoning and fuzzy reasoning to obtain the most likely conclusion, rather than requiring absolutely accurate derivations. If the relevant knowledge is missing, the system marks \"uncertain\" but continues the decision-making process and seeks external information if necessary (e.g. querying a database or asking a user). This is equivalent to creating a \"fault-tolerant safety net\" for the system: allowing a certain level of knowledge gap to exist, as long as the overall purpose can be advanced, it will not collapse completely because of a gap.</p>\n<p>The fault-tolerant strategy is complemented by an adaptive computational annealing mechanism. The idea of simulated annealing algorithm is borrowed here, which means that when the system explores the solution space, it is allowed to introduce random perturbations or reduce the target requirements in stages to jump out of the local optimal or dead-end state. Specifically, when the AI fails to find a solution that satisfies the purpose of the Wisdom decision-making layer for many consecutive times, the middleware will trigger the \"annealing\" process: temporarily relax or change certain constraints, such as lowering the priority of secondary goals, giving the decision-making module more room for random attempts, etc., and then try to solve it again. This process is similar to a person who \"changes his mind\" and tries a different path after racking his brains to no avail. For example, in a complex planning problem, the system can first randomly try some seemingly suboptimal solutions to gain new insights, and then gradually converge back to a more optimal solution. This kind of active stochastic exploration can effectively avoid the goal never being achieved due to the narrow thinking at the beginning, and improve the probability of the system finding a feasible solution. Of course, the annealing process sets the \"temperature\" parameter to ensure that the amplitude of the disturbance is controllable and gradually converges over a period of time, avoiding the system from being unlimitedly random. The practice shows that when solving the uncertainty problem, the introduction of annealing-like mechanism can improve the robustness and global search ability.</p>\n<p>Another key is semantic recovery path optimization. When the system deviates from its original goal due to wrong intermediate decisions or external interference, it needs an efficient way to self-correct and recover. We draw on the process of \"introspection\" in the human mind: when people realize that they have made a mistake, they usually look back to the previous steps, find the possible problem areas, and re-plan the way forward. In brain-like software, we achieve similar traceability by saving decision trajectories and semantic context information within the DIKWP framework. Specifically, the platform records the multi-layered status of DIKWP at the time of each important decision (e.g., what information was entered, what knowledge was used, and what was the basis for the judgment). When the end result is not ideal, the system can reverse-traverse these trajectories to find out which part of the output does not match expectations. For example, in a dialogue system, if the answer is not satisfactory to the user, the system can trace the historical context of the conversation (layer I) and the knowledge used (layer K), and find that it may be a common sense conflict that leads to the misunderstanding, so it adjusts the knowledge base or reinterprets the user's purpose, and then follows the new path of secondary reasoning to give an improved answer. This recovery process is not a simple retry, but a targeted adjustment based on semantic cues. For example, if it is identified that the problem is a misunderstanding of a technical term, the system partially updates the definition or context of the term, rather than overturning the entire reasoning. This makes the recovery process much more efficient. In addition, we also introduce the idea of multi-path parallel exploration: for key decision points, the middleware can back up the current state, and then try a variety of possible branch decision parallel simulations to move forward, compare which path has the best final effect, and then select the best path as the recovery path actually executed by the system. It's similar to a person considering different options to \"take it one step at a time\" and rehearse the results so as not to waste a lot of time on a dead end.</p>\n<p>Through these strategies, our platform will be resilient and resilient to humans in the face of an imperfect world. As the \"bug theory\" reveals, it is those imperfections that create creativity. Rather than stagnating in pursuit of absolute perfection, our system allows for a certain level of \"compromise\" and \"trial and error\", but constantly self-correcting and learning in the process. Each fault-tolerant process, annealing attempt, and recovery optimization actually enriches the system's understanding of the problem, improves its knowledge base, and expands its policy base. Over time, the system will become more perfect in the midst of imperfections. This shift in design philosophy will transform AI from a fragile mechanical actuator to a robust autonomous agent – like an experienced human expert who can learn from mistakes and robust its mission in an uncertain environment.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Analysis-of-typical-application-scenarios\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Analysis-of-typical-application-scenarios\" title=\"Analysis of typical application scenarios\"></a><strong>Analysis of typical application scenarios</strong></h1><p>In order to verify the practicability of the above-mentioned DIKWP brain-like basic software platform, we selected a number of representative and forward-looking application scenarios for demonstration. These scenarios cover different fields from cognitive simulation, brain-computer interfaces, to next-generation communication chips, fully reflecting the platform's universal adaptability and core value. In each scenario, we'll show how the platform leverages the strengths of the DIKWP model, solves existing technical pain points, and creates new features or performance breakthroughs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Scenario-1-A-cognitive-simulation-platform-based-on-DIKWP-semantic-middleware\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Scenario-1-A-cognitive-simulation-platform-based-on-DIKWP-semantic-middleware\" title=\"Scenario 1: A cognitive simulation platform based on DIKWP semantic middleware\"></a><strong>Scenario 1: A cognitive simulation platform based on DIKWP semantic middleware</strong></h2><p><strong>Background: The</strong> cognitive simulation platform is designed to simulate the cognitive processes of humans or animals, and is used for cognitive science research, brain-inspired algorithm validation, and decision support for complex systems. For example, simulating the cognitive response of a human driver in a virtual environment to test the safety of autonomous driving systems; Or simulate the cognitive process in doctor-patient dialogue to train intelligent consultation assistants. Traditional simulation platforms often use preset rules or machine learning models to simulate cognition, but they lack a unified semantic framework, which makes it difficult to achieve high-level interpretability and flexible adjustment.</p>\n<p><strong>DIKWP Platform Solution:</strong> With our basic software platform, you can build a multi-agent cognitive simulation environment. Each agent, such as a simulated driver, doctor, or patient, runs an instance of the DIKWP model internally. In this way, the agent's behavior in the virtual environment will be determined by the five layers of cognitive states within it. For example, the visual input of a simulated driver enters as \"data\", the \"information\" layer extracts key points such as traffic signals and road conditions, the \"knowledge\" layer contains his driving experience and traffic rules, the \"wisdom\" layer makes driving decisions based on it, and the \"purpose\" layer represents his driving purpose (e.g., arriving on time, safety first, etc.). These cognitive processes are transparent to the researcher because the platform allows us to examine the content of each agent at each DIKWP layer at any given moment – the equivalent of reading \"what it is seeing, thinking, and wanting\" in real time. This provides valuable white-box analysis capabilities for cognitive science experiments. Instead of only observing behavioral outputs, we can now drill down into internal processes. For example, we can verify whether an improvement allows the agent to learn new rules at the knowledge layer, whether the decision at the wisdom layer is more in line with its purpose, and so on, thus greatly improving the explanatory and persuasive power of the simulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Dynamic interaction and adaptation:</strong> Multiple agents interact with each other through the platform's semantic middleware. The \"Wisdom\" decisions output by one agent are performed by the environment and may become the \"data\" input of another agent. Since all agents share a unified DIKWP semantic protocol, they can naturally understand the meaning of each other's actions. For example, in the doctor-patient dialogue simulation, both the doctor AI and the patient AI are driven by the DIKWP model, so the doctor's words are not only used as string input by the patient model, but also rise to the patient's knowledge and Purpose layer to influence their next response. Previously, Tang et al. have tried to use the DIKWP theory to simulate the generation and flow of data, information, knowledge, wisdom, and purpose in the brains of doctors and patients in the consultation scenario, and construct a deep cognitive interaction model to better explain the dialogue process. Our platform makes it easier to implement such complex interactions. In addition, each agent has the ability to adapt to faults supported by the BUG theory. This means that during the simulation process, even if there are anomalies (such as sensor errors, blind spots in the character's knowledge), the agent can continue to talk or operate with uncertainty like a human, and will not be stalled in the event of an accident. This brings the simulation closer to reality and allows us to test the behavior of the system under various anomalies.</p>\n<p><strong>Significance and value:</strong> Based on the DIKWP platform, cognitive simulation is no longer a simple replication of behavior, but a real mechanistic simulation - we are simulating the cognitive process itself. This has significant implications for cognitive science research and can be used to test new theories about consciousness and decision-making. For example, what will be the macro performance of agents with different \"Purpose\" settings in a cooperative game? For example, if the intelligence layer capabilities of individuals are gradually enhanced in the swarm agent, how will group decision-making evolve? These scientific questions can be easily experimented on this platform. For engineering applications, this simulation can help us uncover potential problems with complex AI systems. Since we can examine the internal state of each step in the simulation, when the simulation finds that an AI makes an inappropriate decision in a particular situation, we can trace the cause, is it a perceptual error? Knowledge deficits? Or is it a Purpose conflict? In turn, the algorithm can be improved or training data can be provided in a targeted manner. In conclusion, the DIKWP cognitive simulation platform will become an important tool for AI system research and development, shorten the commissioning cycle and improve safety and reliability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Scenario-2-Brain-Computer-Interface-BCI-control-system\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Scenario-2-Brain-Computer-Interface-BCI-control-system\" title=\"Scenario 2: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) control system\"></a><strong>Scenario 2: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) control system</strong></h2><p><strong>Background:</strong> Brain-computer interface technology is dedicated to the direct interaction between the brain and computers/mechanical devices, such as allowing paralyzed patients to control robotic arms with their minds and type with brain waves. Current BCI systems rely primarily on pattern recognition of brain signals (e.g., EEG, ECOG) and mapping them to a limited number of instructions. However, due to the noisy brain signals that vary from person to person, the system often misjudges or fails to recognize. In addition, the user's purpose is often a complex high-level target, and the existing BCI decoding can only capture simple instructions, lacking an understanding of the user's real needs.</p>\n<p><strong>DIKWP Platform Solution:</strong> Our platform can provide an end-to-end semantic decoding and control framework for BCI systems. Specifically, the DIKWP model is introduced into the BCI signal processing pipeline: the brain signal is input as the lowest level of data D, and the meaningful brain signal features (which may correspond to the user's initial thoughts, such as the original impulse of \"left\" and \"right\" shift) are extracted through the information layer, and then the higher-level semantic purpose is deduced by the knowledge layer combined with the user's background (such as known preferences and current situation), and finally the Wisdom layer formulates the action plan, Purpose Layers ensure alignment with user expectations. For example, a patient wearing a BCI wants to grab a cup on the table and drink water. Traditional BCI may need to train brain signals such as \"raise your hand\" and \"clench your fist\", and then send them out in turn. The DIKWP-based BCI system can try to directly decode the user's goal (P-layer: \"drinking water\"), and use the knowledge layer (cup position, grasping common sense) and the Wisdom layer to plan a series of actions to adaptively complete - such as adjusting the position of the wheelchair first and then reaching out to grab the cup. If there is a deviation in a certain step (the patient's distraction causes the signal to be abnormal), the system can automatically tolerate errors, such as pausing the action or continuing the execution based on the camera's visual compensation information, and will not stop due to a momentary signal instability.</p>\n<p><strong>Purpose Adaptive and human-machine integration:</strong> The introduction of the DIKWP framework can also allow the BCI system to form a closed-loop interaction with users. Traditional BCI is one-way: from the brain to the machine. We can use the Purpose layer to enable two-way communication: when the system is unsure about the user's Purpose, it can generate feedback (through visual cues or stimuli) to guide the user to clarify the Purpose. This is somewhat similar to a brain-controlled robot asking the user, \"Are you going to take a cup?\" \"It's just that the way to do it is more subtle (e.g., using the P300 brain wave response test to test user confirmation). In addition, because we structure the user's brain state information into the DIKWP layers, the system can accumulate the user's personalized cognitive model. For example, if a user has low attention (W-layer efficiency) in the morning, he may reduce complex operations or strengthen the Purpose layer validation in the morning. If it is found that the user's brain signal interference is large when listening to music, the knowledge layer will mark the low decoding reliability at this time, so that the Wisdom layer can adopt a more conservative action strategy to ensure security.</p>\n<p><strong>Security and ethical considerations:</strong> BCI is also supported by the platform's built-in semantic middleware and security mechanisms. For example, we can set the value criterion of the Purpose layer: even if the user is impulsive (the brain signal shows that he wants to do a dangerous action), the system can politely refuse or ask for additional confirmation after evaluating the risk at the Wisdom layer. This is akin to a \"conscious\" assistant who weighs the consequences of actions rather than blindly executing them, thus avoiding potential harm. For example, in the medical scenario, the BCI system needs to be highly reliable, and any decoding error can have serious consequences. Our bug-tolerant mechanism can rather not do it when the system is uncertain: when the confidence level of brain signal interpretation is insufficient, the system would rather pause the action and guide the user to try again, rather than rush to execute the questionable instruction. At the same time, multi-channel information fusion (such as combining eye movements, electromyography, etc.) can also improve the accuracy through the knowledge layer. These designs have significantly improved the security and user trust of BCI controls.</p>\n<p>Overall, with the DIKWP platform, BCI systems will be upgraded from \"signal control\" <strong>to</strong> \"purpose understanding\". It's no longer just listening to the brain's superficial electrical signals, it's really trying to read the user's thoughts and get things done. This not only improves the user experience (the user does not need to learn too many rigid instructions, the system will \"guess\" and help complete the purpose), but also expands the application boundaries of BCI - from simple device control to more complex daily assistants, and even brain-controlled creation. For users with disabilities, this is an important step towards the goal of \"everything comes true\".</p>\n<h2 id=\"Scenario-3-A-low-power-semantic-scheduling-chip-framework-for-6G-communication\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Scenario-3-A-low-power-semantic-scheduling-chip-framework-for-6G-communication\" title=\"Scenario 3: A low-power semantic scheduling chip framework for 6G communication\"></a><strong>Scenario 3: A low-power semantic scheduling chip framework for 6G communication</strong></h2><p><strong>Application background:</strong><br/>In the future 6G era, the communication paradigm will shift from the pursuit of bit rate to the focus on semantic efficiency and task orientation. The so-called semantic communication, that is, the transmitting end only sends information that is meaningful to the receiving end to reduce the transmission of useless data. This is seen as a key way to break through the limits of traditional Shannon and improve communication efficiency. At present, the industry has experimentally verified the great potential of semantic communication: by introducing semantic understanding on 4G links, it can achieve an effective transmission capability comparable to that of 6G. However, implementing semantic communication requires an end-to-end system with an understanding of the content being transmitted and awareness of the user's purpose, which is far beyond what current communication protocols can support. Therefore, there is a view that 6G will integrate communication and AI to achieve a \"semantic network\", in which the network can intelligently schedule resources according to business semantics.</p>\n<p><strong>DIKWP platform solution:</strong><br/>Our brain-like basic software platform is very suitable for the development needs of 6G semantic communication. Specifically, a semantic scheduling chip can be deployed in a communication terminal or base station, and the underlying layer is supported by DIKWP middleware, which is responsible for introducing semantic intelligence in all aspects of the communication process. For example, on the sender side, after the data is processed by the DIKWP model, only the information that reaches a certain knowledge/wisdom value will be actually sent through the channel, reducing redundancy. On the network side, middleware schedules spectrum and power resources according to a global purpose (such as ensuring low latency for a certain type of emergency service), and gives more resources to data streams with high semantic value. To give an example: in the 6G application for augmented reality (AR), the purpose of the user terminal may be to \"pay attention to the road navigation information ahead\", then the terminal can use the DIKWP framework to conduct local analysis of the camera video (extract information such as roads and road signs and other information layer I, combined with the map knowledge K layer), and only send the extracted navigation semantics (such as \"turn right at the next intersection, go 200 meters\" such as W-layer decision) to the server, without uploading the entire HD video stream. This not only saves bandwidth, but also reduces the energy consumption of the terminal. Based on this semantic information, the receiver synthesizes it locally and gives a simple prompt to the user to complete the task.</p>\n<p><strong>Low-power advantage:</strong><br/>Since DIKWP middleware has an energy-semantic mapping function, it can dynamically weigh communication consumption and semantic value. When the network load is high or the terminal battery is low, the system automatically cuts the transmission of data with low semantic benefits. For example, for an environmental monitoring sensor network, in the stationary state, each node only needs to periodically upload summary information (the abnormal indicator extracted by the Wisdom layer), and a large amount of raw data (D layer) is not uploaded. Only when the middleware determines that an anomaly may occur (for example, a sudden change in the data of a station requires more detailed information K layer confirmation), the policy will be temporarily relaxed to allow the node to upload more raw data for analysis. Once confirmed, throttling mode is resumed. This on-demand transmission strategy greatly reduces the usual power consumption and ensures accuracy at critical moments.</p>\n<p><strong>Purpose-driven network resource scheduling:</strong><br/>In 6G scenarios, not only terminal devices but also the network itself can have a purpose. For example, the purpose of an emergency communication network is to \"maximize the delivery rate and timeliness of important messages\". Our platform can introduce this network-level purpose into the scheduling algorithm: the middleware of the base station or routing device continuously evaluates whether the currently transmitted stream serves the network purpose, and prioritizes the weighted scheduling for important semantic traffic. Traditional QoS may be based on service type or user level, while semantic QoS truly schedules resources according to the importance of the information itself. Academician Zhang Ping and other experts pointed out that modern semantic communication will promote the paradigm shift of communication, and its excellent performance has been verified in scenarios such as unmanned driving and satellite Internet of Things. Our platform further enables semantic cognitive networks through Purpose scheduling: the network is able to \"understand\" what information is most critical in the current environment and make decisions similar to those of a human dispatcher. This is extremely important for the many scenarios that 6G needs to support (such as massive IoT, industrial control, and real-time interaction in the metaverse).</p>\n<p><strong>Expected results:</strong><br/>The DIKWP semantic intelligence communication chip can realize semantic processing at the hardware level, greatly reduce the end-to-end communication volume and latency, and improve reliability. According to reports, semantic communication is expected to improve the network by an order of magnitude in terms of capacity, coverage, and efficiency. More importantly, it changes the status quo of \"transmitting useless data\", allowing the network to transmit more meaningful data and truly achieve on-demand communication, which also makes the network resource allocation more green and energy-saving. Imagine the future of 6G terminals: equipped with our semantic scheduling chip, it can intelligently adjust the uplink and downlink data strategy according to the user's current task, so that the terminal traffic utilization and battery life are significantly increased, and the network congestion is also reduced. This will be a model of the deep integration of communication technology and artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Through the analysis of the above three scenarios, we can see the broad application prospects of the DIKWP brain-like computing basic software platform. Whether it is in the field of AI cognitive research and simulation, <strong>human-computer interaction control, or new intelligent communication, this platform can play a unique role. This is due to its core semantic modeling,</strong> purpose-driven, adaptive fault tolerance and other innovations, which can be embedded in various complex systems to become the underlying \"Wisdom Engine\". For industry investors, these scenarios also represent huge market opportunities in the future: cognitive simulation and intelligent middle platform will serve the digital transformation of enterprises, BCI and auxiliary medical equipment market prospects are considerable, and 6G semantic communication is a major strategic highland for future communication infrastructure. Once the platform is implemented in these areas, it will generate significant business value and social benefits.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Conclusions-and-prospects\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Conclusions-and-prospects\" title=\"Conclusions and prospects\"></a><strong>Conclusions and prospects</strong></h1><p>To sum up, the basic software platform for brain-inspired computing based on DIKWP and artificial consciousness theory builds a basic software solution for the future intelligent era through original architecture design and core technology integration. It uses the DIKWP five-layer semantic network as the skeleton to make the AI system have a clear cognitive level and internal interpretability. Integrate the TRIZ innovation paradigm to ensure that the platform itself can continue to evolve and meet the needs of users; The use <strong>of purpose-driven programming and scheduling</strong> greatly improves the software's adaptability to complex and dynamic tasks. The semantic middleware layer is introduced to break down the barriers between heterogeneous hardware and high-level semantics, and realize the optimal utilization of resources and energy semantic mapping. Combined with the \"BUG\" fault tolerance theory, the system is endowed with robust performance in a human-like imperfect environment; And it shows its versatility and transformative potential in a number of typical scenarios. It can be said that this platform reflects a deep insight and leadership into the next generation of artificial intelligence technology trends from architecture, methods to applications.</p>\n<p>Our ultimate goal is not only to develop a software system, but to create a set of brain-like computing infrastructure platforms with independent intellectual property rights and suitable for a variety of scenarios, and become a strategic base support for China in the field of brain-like artificial intelligence. Globally, AI technology is entering a critical period of competition for the underlying architecture and ecosystem. Through the implementation of this project, we are expected to take the lead in establishing an industrial system of semantic intelligence, including cognitive middle-end solutions for different industries, software stacks for collaborative optimization with domestic brain-like chips, standard tools for artificial awareness evaluation and security governance, and so on. This will fill the gap in the field of artificial consciousness and brain-like operating system in China, and greatly enhance the core competitiveness of China's AI industry.</p>\n<p>At present, Professor Yucong Duan's team has built a patent pool covering 99 domestic and foreign authorized invention patents and 15 PCT international patents around the DIKWP model, forming a solid intellectual property moat in the field of AI cognition and artificial awareness. The combination of these patented technologies is highly systematic and innovative, giving us a unique voice and cooperation value in the competition and cooperation with international technology giants. With the boom of large models such as ChatGPT and Claude, there is an urgent need for all walks of life to solve the AI black box and improve credibility. The \"DIKWP semantic operating system\" and related technologies are expected to be quickly integrated into existing platforms through patent licensing or joint development, and become the core components of next-generation AI systems, with a huge potential market size. We believe that with the help of industrial capital, these cutting-edge achievements will accelerate from the laboratory to industrial application and be transformed into real productivity.</p>\n<p>Finally, we warmly appeal to the cooperation and support of the industry. As the report said, these innovative technologies are still in the stage of large-scale transformation, and there is an urgent need for funds, resources and platforms to accelerate their implementation. The project team will uphold an open and cooperative attitude, give full play to the advantages of multidisciplinary interdisciplinarity, and work with investors and industry partners to improve product solutions and expand the application ecosystem. In the next 3-5 years, we plan to gradually establish the standard status of DIKWP brain-like basic software in China through demonstration application verification and large-scale promotion, and promote it to the international market to participate in the competition and cooperation of the global artificial intelligence underlying architecture.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to the future, an <strong>era of universal language and wisdom is coming. From smart factories to</strong> smart cities, from personal assistants to swarm intelligence, strong semantic understanding and autonomous decision-making are needed everywhere. We have reason to believe that the brain-inspired computing basic software platform based on the DIKWP artificial consciousness model will become one of the key foundation technologies leading this era. The paradigm of \"semantic intelligence\" it represents will enable China to seize the commanding heights in the new round of AI transformation and create a new world-leading industrial ecosystem. With the joint efforts of all parties, we look forward to this innovative achievement with independent IP taking root and bearing fruitful results, contributing to China's wisdom and creating historical opportunities for promoting artificial intelligence from perceptual intelligence to cognitive intelligence, and from tool-based AI to autonomous AI.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

However, today's AI systems are still deficient in these dimensions of social intelligence, especially in multi-agent interaction scenarios. For example, it will be the norm for multiple AIs to plan, cooperate, and even compete at the same time in real-world applications, but a lack of inference about the purpose of others, moral assessment of the consequences of behavior, and understanding and response to emotions can lead to conflict, distrust, and even security risks. At present, some researchers have developed multi-agent simulation platforms such as \"large-scale social simulators\" to deduce the impact of group decision-making and assist social governance through value modeling and digital twin technology. This indicates that multi-agent social-level intelligence is becoming an important direction for the development of artificial intelligence. Therefore, endowing artificial intelligence with brain-like social cognitive capabilities not only has great academic value, but also an important way to ensure the safety and controllability of complex AI systems and benefit society.</p>\n<p>Advances in brain science have provided inspiration for artificial intelligence: neuroscience research has shown that specific mechanisms in the human brain underpin higher-order social intelligence functions. For example, the ability of the Theory of Mind (ToM) enables humans to speculate about the mental state of others (beliefs, purposes), depending on the role of regions such as the prefrontal lobes of the brain; <strong>Empathy is related to physiological mechanisms such as the mirror neuron system, which allows us to perceive and share the emotions of others. More importantly,</strong> ToM and empathy together form the basis of human moral cognition—ToM provides cognitive understanding of others, empathy provides emotional drive, and the two synergistically shape moral judgments. These findings suggest that we can draw on the brain-like principle to construct an artificial social intelligence algorithm mechanism, so that AI can have human-like purpose recognition, ethical reasoning, and emotional understanding capabilities in a multi-agent environment.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of application, AI with social intelligence will greatly expand the application depth and trust of multi-agent systems. In terms of human-computer interaction, social intelligence makes agents more empathetic and ethical, which can be used to accompany robots, intelligent customer service, etc., to improve user satisfaction and acceptance. In multi-robot collaboration and even unmanned system clusters, the addition of purpose inference and moral constraints can reduce internal friction conflicts and ensure the safety and reliability of collaborative tasks. In key <strong>fields such as medical care and education, the introduction of AI's empathy and moral judgment capabilities is expected to promote doctor-patient trust and teacher-student interaction, forming a</strong> new paradigm of \"AI + human\" collaboration and efficiency. Overall, based on the major needs of the country, this project aims to break through the bottleneck of artificial intelligence social cognition, build brain-like social intelligence algorithms and systems, and promote the safe, ethical and sustainable development of multi-agent technology.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Project-objectives-and-key-issues\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Project-objectives-and-key-issues\" title=\"Project objectives and key issues\"></a><strong>Project objectives and key issues</strong></h1><p>The overall goal of this project is to build brain-inspired social reasoning capabilities through the DIKWP semantic system, and to develop brain-inspired social intelligence algorithms and prototype systems for multi-agent interaction. Specifically, the following three aspects of brain-like social intelligence capabilities are given to artificial intelligence, and on this basis, they are integrated and verified:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Purpose Modeling and Understanding: Develop the machine's \"Theory of Mind\" function to enable agents to infer the implicit goal and belief states of others from interactions, and support prediction of others' behavior and appropriate responses.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Moral reasoning and decision-making: The agent is given a mechanism for moral evaluation when making decisions, comprehensively considering the ethical norms and social consequences of behavior, and realizing the constraints on one's own behavior and the evaluation of others' behavior. So that AI decision-making is not only \"effective\" but also \"ethical\".</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Affective empathy and response: Enables agents to perceive and understand the emotional states of humans or other agents, appropriately produce empathetic responses, and incorporate this into interaction strategies to show human-like empathy and emotional care.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Key scientific questions that need to be addressed around these goals include:</p>\n<p>(<strong>1</strong>) How to establish a unified knowledge representation and computational framework that integrates data, knowledge, and high-level semantics such as \"Purpose\" to support complex reasoning in the social context?</p>\n<p>(<strong>2</strong>) How to simulate the reasoning mechanism in the brain that implies the purpose of others, and realize the purpose recognition and prediction of artificial intelligence?</p>\n<p>(<strong>3</strong>) How to formalize human moral norms into computable rules or models, and combine them with machine learning to make agents embed ethical constraints in self-directed learning?</p>\n<p>(<strong>4</strong>) How to simulate and measure the empathy ability of artificial intelligence so that it can respond appropriately to changes in the emotions of others and influence decision-making?</p>\n<p>(<strong>5</strong>) How to ensure that the above process is explainable and trustworthy to avoid becoming a \"black box\"? The solution of these problems will provide a theoretical and technical basis for injecting brain-like social intelligence into multi-agent systems, and it is also the core of the innovation of this project.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Theoretical-basis-and-innovation-points\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Theoretical-basis-and-innovation-points\" title=\"Theoretical basis and innovation points\"></a><strong>Theoretical basis and innovation points</strong></h1><p>In order to realize brain-like social intelligence, this project will draw on the previous research results of the application team in artificial consciousness and semantic intelligence, and propose an innovative framework that integrates multi-level semantic representation, elastic semantic network and self-explanatory mechanism. Its theoretical basis mainly includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>DIKWP Semantic Model: Prof. Yucong Duan's team proposed the DIKWP model, which extends the classic information processing pyramid DIKW (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) and introduces a new element of \"Purpose (Purpose)\". DIKWP uses a hierarchical semantic structure to describe the cognitive process of agents: from raw data, through information extraction and knowledge condensation to wisdom decision-making, and the top-level Purpose drives and oversees the lower-level processes. This extension enables the model to embody a goal-oriented cognitive flow and to represent the internal motivation and purposiveness of the agent.</strong> The DIKWP model provides unified semantic coordinates for cognitive computing and realizes the semantic link from perceptual data to high-level decision-making, which is the fundamental framework for this project to build social reasoning ability.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Mesh Semantic Elastic Network: Different from the static hierarchical model, DIKWP will be implemented as a mesh semantic network in this project</strong>, and each hierarchical element forms an elastic connection through two-way interaction. Professor Yucong Duan proposed that in the mesh DIKWP model, there are 25 interactive modules between the five layers of data, information, knowledge, wisdom and purpose, so as to realize the two-way flow and feedback of semantics. This semantic elastic network allows conceptual boundaries to dynamically adjust to the context, and semantic associations are flexible and robust (i.e., semantics elastically change with context). This mechanism helps agents deal with semantic uncertainty in complex social environments, such as the change of meaning of the same behavior in different contexts, the elasticity of concept extension, etc. The introduction of the Semantic Elastic Network will ensure that our agents can flexibly update their understanding of other people's states and environmental contexts in multi-agent interactions, and are not bound by rigid rules.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>ACPU architecture (artificial consciousness processing unit): In order to support the efficient operation and interpretability of the above semantic computing model, we introduce the artificial consciousness computing architecture proposed by Yucong Duan's team</strong>。 The architecture includes a dedicated Artificial Awareness Processing Unit (ACPU) and a supporting operating environment and language to achieve integrated software and hardware design. The core idea is to integrate the support of state of consciousness and semantic concepts on the basis of classical computer architecture, and break through the limitations of traditional systems in cognitive computing. Specifically, ACPU supports the semantic flow of the DIKWP model at the hardware level (such as setting up processing units and control flows such as data, knowledge, and purpose in the chip), making the execution of artificial consciousness algorithms more efficient and controllable. This architecture is expected to improve the real-time inference capabilities of our social intelligence systems and lay the foundation for the development of specialized chips in the future. More importantly, the ACPU architecture aims to make AI systems \"artificially aware\" such as explainable, trustworthy, and consistent behavior. This explainable AI philosophy permeates the design of our systems, ensuring that the algorithmic decision-making process is transparent and traceable.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Self-explanatory mechanism: In view of the high complexity and high risk of social intelligence decision-making, we have integrated a self-explainable mechanism into the architecture. Specifically, an interpretation module is set up inside the agent to perform metacognitive monitoring and causal chain extraction for key decisions, and generate human-understandable interpretation outputs. For example, when an agent makes a moral evaluation of another person's behavior or chooses a response, the system will simultaneously provide an explanation that clarifies the purpose assumptions, moral principle basis, and emotional considerations in its reasoning process. On the one hand, this self-explanatory ability improves the transparency and credibility of the system, and responds to the requirements of AI ethics for explainability. On the other hand, it also helps agents to engage in reflective learning</strong> and improve future performance by examining their own decision-making logic. This project will explore technologies such as generative language models to enrich the expression of explanations and make them easy for humans to understand, so as to build a truly \"<strong>understandable</strong>\" social agent.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, the theoretical innovation of this project is embodied in the combination of the DIKWP artificial consciousness model and the multi-agent social intelligence needs, and the creative introduction of purpose-driven semantic representation, mesh elastic semantic network and interpretable artificial consciousness architecture to form a <strong>new paradigm of \"comprehensive theory + technical framework</strong>\". This paradigm is different from traditional pure data-driven or symbolic AI methods, emphasizing multi-level semantic fusion and cognitive mechanism biomimicry, which is expected to provide breakthroughs for AI to achieve advanced social behavior.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Brain-inspired-social-intelligence-algorithm-framework-design\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Brain-inspired-social-intelligence-algorithm-framework-design\" title=\"Brain-inspired social intelligence algorithm framework design\"></a><strong>Brain-inspired social intelligence algorithm framework design</strong></h1><p>Based on the above theoretical basis, we design a brain-inspired social intelligence algorithm framework to endow agents with the ability to conduct social reasoning in human-computer/inter-machine interaction. The framework is shown in Figure 1 (omitted), using the DIKWP semantic system as the overall architecture: the bottom layer is the data layer (D) obtained by environmental awareness, which gradually rises to the information layer <strong>(I) of information processing and the knowledge layer (K) of knowledge abstraction</strong>, and forms the Wisdom layer (W) <strong>of comprehensive decision-making at the top</strong> level, and is composed of the top layer <strong>The Purpose layer (P) provides drive and regulation. In the framework, each layer is connected by a semantic network to support the two-way dynamic flow of cognitive processing: on the one hand, the high-level purpose and moral principles can constrain the bottom-level behavior choice from the top down; On the other hand, the underlying perception and interactive feedback update the cognitive state of the upper level from the bottom up. Focusing on the framework, we focus on designing the following core functional modules</strong>:</p>\n<h2 id=\"Purpose-Modeling-Mechanism-Brain-like-Theory-of-Mind\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Purpose-Modeling-Mechanism-Brain-like-Theory-of-Mind\" title='Purpose Modeling Mechanism (Brain-like \"Theory of Mind\")'></a><strong>Purpose Modeling Mechanism (Brain-like \"Theory of Mind\")</strong></h2><p><strong>The Purpose Modeling Module is designed to equip agents with the ability to understand and predict the behavior of other agents</strong>, which is equivalent to the theory of mind function of a machine. In the DIKWP framework, this module mainly involves <strong>the interaction between the knowledge layer and the purpose layer: the agent starts from the perceived behavior data of others, extracts key information, rises to the knowledge layer to form a representation of the state of others, and in the</strong> The Purpose layer generates assumptions about the goal/purpose of others. To achieve this, we will fuse a probabilistic graph model with deep learning techniques: construct a probability map of another person's mental state (including possible beliefs, wishes, purposes, etc.), and train a deep neural network to update the distribution of this graph from the observation sequence. Each agent maintains a mental model of the other body, which is constantly updated with interactions. It is worth noting that we introduce a hypothesis-testing reasoning process: the agent generates multiple hypotheses about the purpose of others based on current information, and tests the plausibility of these assumptions by predicting the next behavior of others, gradually converging to the best hypothesis. This process is similar to the repeated correction mechanism when humans speculate on the purpose of others, and it is also a manifestation of the brain-like characteristics.</p>\n<p>In terms of algorithm implementation, the method based on rules and Bayesian inference can be used to design algorithm judgment rules for typical scenarios (for example, a predefined purpose library can be matched by other people's action sequences). With the accumulation of data, reinforcement learning or meta-learning mechanisms are introduced, so that agents can learn more complex purpose inference strategies autonomously through trial-and-error interaction. We draw on Stanford's \"Hypothetical Minds\" framework, in which a dedicated ToM module generates hypotheses about other agents' strategies and goals, improving adaptability in multi-agent collaboration and adversarial scenarios. Experiments show that the performance of this kind of agent based on mental modeling is significantly better than that of traditional deep reinforcement learning agents in competition and cooperation environment. Inspired by this, the Purpose modeling module of this project will make full use of large models and knowledge graph technology to achieve highly generalized Purpose recognition and behavior prediction of others in a complex environment with multiple agents.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Mechanisms-of-Moral-Reasoning-Embedded-Ethical-Decision-making\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Mechanisms-of-Moral-Reasoning-Embedded-Ethical-Decision-making\" title=\"Mechanisms of Moral Reasoning (Embedded Ethical Decision-making)\"></a><strong>Mechanisms of Moral Reasoning (Embedded Ethical Decision-making)</strong></h2><p><strong>The moral reasoning module gives agents the ability to make ethical judgments when making decisions, ensuring that their actions are in line with the moral norms and values of human society. In the DIKWP architecture, moral reasoning mainly acts on the Wisdom layer (W):</strong> as an evaluation constraint mechanism for final decision-making, it evaluates and scores the moral value of alternative behavior schemes, and influences the goal setting of the Purpose layer (e.g., eliminating immoral goals). To construct this module, we will integrate symbolic logical reasoning and data-driven learning methods to form a blended ethical decision-making system.</p>\n<p>First, a formal moral knowledge base is established at the symbolic level. Refer to ethical theories (such as responsibility ethics, consequentialism, virtue ethics, etc.) to extract the principles and rules applicable to AI behavior. For example, classical ethical norms (the principle of non-harm, the principle of fairness, etc.) can be encoded as logical rules, or a system of rules for tolerance of non-compliance (defeasible rules) can be used to deal with conflict of principles in complex situations. Secondly, a value-aligned learning method is introduced at the learning level, so that agents can learn moral preferences from human feedback. Specifically, reverse reinforcement learning <strong>(IRL) can be used to summarize the implicit ethical norms from human behavior, or reinforcement learning training with human preference feedback can be used to make agents consider the reward and punishment of the moral dimension when optimizing multiple objectives. Previous reviews have shown that the current popular practice is often limited to pure rules or pure learning, and lacks an intermediate solution that is both adaptable and controllable. Therefore, the innovation of this project is to design a hybrid architecture at the top level</strong>: the agent not only refers to the built-in ethical rules when making decisions, but also dynamically adjusts the weight of moral preferences through learning, so as to achieve robust and explainable moral reasoning.</p>\n<p>In specific applications, the Moral Reasoning module will be used to assess the social impact of multi-agent action scenarios. For example, in the group decision-making of unmanned vehicles, the introduction of moral evaluation can avoid undesirable group behaviors such as vehicle rushing. In medical AI, embedding ethical judgments prevents decisions that violate medical ethics (e.g., excessive diagnosis and treatment or privacy breaches). We plan to design a series of moral dilemma scenarios (such as the famous tram problem) to test the agent's ability to make ethical decisions to ensure that it meets human moral expectations when weighing its own interests against the interests of others. At the same time, with the help of the method of moral judgment agency, an independent adjudication sub-module is used to monitor the agent's behavior and give ethical judgment from the perspective of a third party. The result of this ruling can be used to correct the decision-making of the main agent and enhance the security and credibility of the system architecture.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Affective-Empathy-Mechanism-Artificial-Empathy-Computation\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Affective-Empathy-Mechanism-Artificial-Empathy-Computation\" title=\"Affective Empathy Mechanism (Artificial Empathy Computation)\"></a><strong>Affective Empathy Mechanism (Artificial Empathy Computation)</strong></h2><p><strong>The Affective Empathy module enables agents to perceive the emotional states of others and generate corresponding emotional responses, simulating human empathy. In the DIKWP architecture, the empathy process involves the extraction of emotional cues from others at the information layer (I) and the representation of emotional semantics by the knowledge layer (K), and finally feedback to influence the decision-making of the Wisdom layer (e.g., adjusting the original plan due to empathy). Our implementation will draw on affective computing and cognitive psychology models to give agents the ability to infer emotions from multimodal information and regulate their own behavior to respond to the emotions of others.</strong></p>\n<p>First of all, in terms of emotion perception, we will use multimodal emotion recognition technology: combined with text semantic analysis, voice intonation features, facial expression recognition (during human-computer interaction) or other proxy behavior signals, to judge the category and intensity of others' emotions at the information layer. For purely virtual agent interaction situations, emotions can be inferred by deviations from their behavioral strategies (e.g., sudden conservatism may indicate fear). Secondly, in terms of emotional response, we design an empathy strategy for the agent: when the agent detects that the other person is in a certain emotional state, the agent simulates the corresponding emotional resonance through internal state regulation (for example, when the other person is depressed, he or she feels sympathy and comforts), and considers this emotion in decision-making (such as slowing down the pace of competition, providing help, etc.). This mechanism is similar to the phenomenon of members of a human team influencing each other's emotions to coordinate and cooperate.</p>\n<p>Algorithmically, we will construct an artificial empathy model that integrates cognitive empathy (understanding the reasons for others' emotions) and emotional empathy (empathizing with others' emotions). One possible solution is to use a fuzzy logic system to deal with the uncertainty of emotional information: for example, to take other people's emotions and situations as fuzzy inputs and deduce the appropriate level of response. Previous studies have suggested that integrating empathy into multi-agent decision-making can significantly improve the efficiency of team collaboration. Our system will verify this in a multi-agent collaboration task: the group of agents expected to have empathy mechanisms outperform cold rational agents in terms of communication costs, conflict resolution, and synergistic benefits. A study pointed out that the introduction of an empathy layer for autonomists to evaluate and respond to the state of others can provide a dynamic way of information sharing, which is especially beneficial for large heterogeneous agent teams to complete tasks efficiently. Based on this, an empathy algorithm is designed to enable agents to optimize the group decision-making process through the \"emotion perception-feedback\" loop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Semantic-fusion-vs-self-explanatory-integration\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Semantic-fusion-vs-self-explanatory-integration\" title=\"Semantic fusion vs. self-explanatory integration\"></a><strong>Semantic fusion vs. self-explanatory integration</strong></h2><p>The above three mechanisms, Purpose, Morality, and Empathy, do not exist in isolation, but need to be organically integrated and interacted within the semantic framework of DIKWP. We will build a semantic blackboard or shared knowledge graph as the center, and the agent's various cognitions of the environment and others (including others' purpose assumptions, moral evaluations, and emotional states) will be uniformly represented in the knowledge layer, which will be comprehensively considered by the wisdom layer when making decisions. For example, when the Purpose Reasoning module judges that a partner's purpose is \"asking for help\" and the empathy module detects that the partner is depressed, the moral reasoning module will assign a higher ethical value to \"help the partner\", and finally the Wisdom layer chooses to assist in action. This decision-making method of multi-dimensional factors is in line with the human social behavior model, and also gives full play to the advantages of the context association of the DIKWP model.</p>\n<p>At the same time, all key inference processes record their semantic inference links through the self-explanatory module. As soon as the agent makes an important decision or behaves abnormally, the system generates an explanatory report that states: \"<strong>Because the agent predicts that the other person's</strong> purpose is X, and according to the moral principle Y, and perceives its emotion Z, <strong>the agent chooses action Q</strong>.\" “。 This interpretation includes both purpose, morality, and emotion, as well as their specific impact on decision-making, enabling human supervisors to understand the logic behind AI behavior. The interpretation module will be reviewed by experts during the testing phase of the system to iteratively improve its clarity and accuracy, ensuring that it ultimately reaches a level that can be used for safety oversight and user communication.</p>\n<p>Through the above framework design, we will implement a brain-like agent system with deep semantic understanding (modeling others and situations through DIKWP), <strong>value orientation</strong> (embedding ethical norms), and emotional intelligence (empathy-driven coordination). It is capable of social reasoning and decision-making close to the human level in complex interactions of multiple agents, and interprets its own reasoning process in a way that is understandable to humans. This lays the architectural foundation for subsequent system implementation and application.</p>\n<h1 id=\"System-platform-construction-and-typical-application-scenarios\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#System-platform-construction-and-typical-application-scenarios\" title=\"System platform construction and typical application scenarios\"></a><strong>System platform construction and typical application scenarios</strong></h1><p>In order to verify and apply the above algorithm framework, this project will build a brain-like social intelligence system platform, including a simulation environment, algorithm software and demonstration application prototypes. The content of platform construction is divided into the following aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Multi-agent semantic interaction simulation platform: Develop a visual simulation platform that supports real-time interaction of multiple agents. The platform will be presented in the form of a virtual environment, which can simulate different scenarios such as social, medical, and education, and allow the embedding of the agent algorithm developed in this project. We will integrate a physics simulation engine and interactive interfaces to enable virtual agents to perceive changes in the environment, communicate with humans or other agents (verbal conversations or non-verbal signals), perform action tasks, and more. The platform will also have built-in semantic monitoring and visualization tools</strong> to display the changes in the internal state of each agent's DIKWP model in real time, such as the purpose reasoning process, moral evaluation values, emotional parameters, etc. This helps developers debug algorithms and visualizes the \"ideas\" and \"emotions\" of AI to domain experts. The simulation platform will serve as a testbed for the integration and verification of various technologies of the project, and will be scalable to continuously add new scenarios and new agent models.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>DIKWP multi-agent semantic interaction system: Develop system software to support the operation of DIKWP model, including core components such as semantic network management, central information blackboard, and interpreter. On the one hand, the system provides an internal cognitive computing framework for each agent</strong> (implementing the processing units and interaction logic of each layer of DIKWP), and on the other hand, manages the communication protocol and shared environment interaction between multiple agents. We will define a semantic communication language that allows agents to pass high-level semantic information between them (e.g., sharing part of knowledge, requesting assistance, etc.), beyond the limitations of traditional multi-agents exchanging simple signals. This semantic interaction mechanism will significantly improve the efficiency of group collaboration and the ability to solve complex tasks. In addition, the system also includes a safety sandbox module to restrain agent behavior in the simulation to avoid loss of control, and a logging module to completely record the decision trajectory and interpretation of the agent in each experiment, which is convenient for offline analysis and continuous improvement.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the above platform, we will select three typical application scenarios for technical verification, each of which corresponds to major practical needs and can fully reflect the value of brain-like social intelligence. The specific scenarios and demonstration schemes are as follows:</p>\n<h2 id=\"Scenario-1-Social-service-robots\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Scenario-1-Social-service-robots\" title=\"Scenario 1: Social service robots\"></a><strong>Scenario 1: Social service robots</strong></h2><p>Scenario description: Several intelligent service robots interact with human users in a semi-structured environment, for example, in the nursing home care scenario, the robots undertake tasks such as companionship and communication, reminding to take medication, and emergency calls, and multiple robots also need to work together to complete tasks such as handling. The human-machine ratio may be many-to-many, and the environment is unpredictable.</p>\n<p>Demands and challenges: Service robots need to deeply understand the needs and purposes of elderly users (e.g., whether the user's fall is an accident or attracting attention), abide by medical and nursing ethics (respect the user's privacy and dignity, do not read the user's personal belongings at will, etc.), and make appropriate comfort to the user's emotional changes (such as soft comfort when the user is frustrated). In the event of an emergency (someone falls), which robots are responsible for comforting and which ones are going to pick up the medical kit need to have moral priorities (saving people over daily chores) and purpose coordination. Traditional robots lack these social intelligences, making it difficult for them to cope with this complex scenario.</p>\n<p><strong>This project is to embed DIKWP social agents in each robot</strong>. When interacting with the elderly, the robot obtains user behavior and expression data through voice and visual perception, identifies the user's emotions (peace of mind/anxiety) at the internal information layer, and speculates on its current purpose (whether it needs help) at the knowledge layer. The Purpose layer, combined with the built-in care purpose drive (the robot has a care purpose), determines the next course of action. If a conflict situation is detected (e.g., two elderly people asking for help at the same time), the ethics module makes decisions based on the principles of risk and fairness: priority is given to those who are at high risk in an emergency, but also shows empathy by verbally reassuring the other person and asking them to wait. Multiple bots negotiate a division of labor through the platform's semantic communication: one bot sends a message \"I'm in charge of patient A, you're in charge of patient B\" with a moral assessment of both, ensuring that all requests for help are covered and resources are allocated fairly. During the whole process, the self-explanatory module records the decision-making basis of each robot, such as \"Because it is detected that elderly person A may have a fracture (Purpose = medical treatment is needed), follow the principle of emergency priority, I will go immediately; At the same time, inform the companion to take care of the elderly person B. This explanation can later be used by caregivers to review whether the robot's response is appropriate.</p>\n<p>Argument: Through simulation experiments and actual scenario tests, we expect that compared with traditional rule-based robots, robots that introduce social intelligence will significantly improve user satisfaction, emergency response success rate and other indicators, and there will be no ethical violations. User surveys are expected to show that older adults have a higher sense of trust in robots with emotional empathy and ethical principles, and are willing to accept their care. The scenario verification will prove that the technology of this project has practical value in real human-computer interaction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Scenario-2-Intelligent-medical-collaboration\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Scenario-2-Intelligent-medical-collaboration\" title=\"Scenario 2: Intelligent medical collaboration\"></a><strong>Scenario 2: Intelligent medical collaboration</strong></h2><p>Scenario description: In the hospital diagnosis and treatment scenario, AI diagnostic assistants and nursing robots are introduced to form a medical team with doctors and nurses. Multiple AI assistants need to work together to handle several patients, participate in decision-making throughout the entire process, from consultation and diagnosis to medication, while working closely with human care.</p>\n<p>Needs and challenges: Medical AI must strictly abide by medical ethics (such as informed consent, privacy protection, and avoiding decision-making bias), understand the purpose of doctors' diagnosis and treatment, and provide valuable references, rather than mechanically giving conclusions that conflict with people. At the same time, it is necessary to be sensitive to the patient's emotions: in the face of anxious patients, the AI should have soothing wording in answering questions; When the patient is in pain, the nursing robot should adjust the intensity of the movement and tone to express care. Multiple AI assistants also need to collaborate on resource scheduling and diagnosis and treatment plans to avoid giving conflicting recommendations and confusing doctors.</p>\n<p><strong>This project solution: Deploy the Purpose recognition module in the AI diagnostic assistant, which can infer the doctor's concerns from his questions and reactions, so as to provide auxiliary decision-making instead of dominating the situation. For example, when a doctor is doing ward rounds, the assistant presumes the doctor's initial diagnosis intention based on the doctor's examination sequence and expression, and searches the relevant cases and precautions in the knowledge base for the doctor's reference. The assistant analyzes the patient's language and facial emotions (empathy module) at the same time, and if the patient is nervous because of the worry, it advises the doctor to explain or suspend certain stimulating topics in a more understandable way. This reflects the positive moderating effect of AI on the doctor-patient relationship. Nursing robots, on the other hand, use built-in ethics (such as the \"Do No Harm Principle\") to ensure the safety and comfort of patients during handling or treatment, such as detecting painful expressions and immediately slowing down and soothing them. Multiple AIs share patient status semantics and resource allocation purposes through the platform</strong> , for example, two diagnostic AIs can inform each other of different assumptions about the same patient and agree on them, or automatically negotiate which one will prioritize new emergency patients (following the ethical guidelines of critical priority).</p>\n<p>Argument: We will test the solution in a simulated hospital environment and compare it with real doctor feedback. Expected results: Medical AI with the blessing of social intelligence can more accurately grasp the purpose of doctors, and the adoption rate of diagnostic suggestions will be increased; Emotional response to patients leads to improved patient satisfaction and compliance, and reduces medical disputes. Under the multi-AI collaboration, the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis and treatment will be better than that of a single machine or no collaboration, and there will be no violation of medical ethics. This validation will demonstrate the potential of our technology in a serious industry (healthcare) and can be used as a reference paradigm for future medical AI system development.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Scenario-3-Intelligent-education-interactive-system\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Scenario-3-Intelligent-education-interactive-system\" title=\"Scenario 3: Intelligent education interactive system\"></a><strong>Scenario 3: Intelligent education interactive system</strong></h2><p>Scenario description: An intelligent education platform that includes AI teacher assistants and several virtual student agents, as well as real student participation. AI teachers are responsible for explaining and tutoring, and student agents simulate different personalities and learning statuses to interact with real students. The whole system is like a hybrid virtual classroom.</p>\n<p>Needs and challenges: In the field of education, which emphasizes individualized teaching and personality development, AI teachers need to understand students' learning purposes (e.g., asking questions for further study or seeking help due to confusion), integrate moral education (e.g., honesty and trustworthiness, cooperative spirit) into teaching strategies, and respond to students' emotional changes (frustration or boredom) in a timely manner and adjust the teaching pace. When multiple students (real + virtual) exist at the same time, AI teachers should pay fair attention to everyone, be impartial, and create a good class atmosphere. This places high demands on the social intelligence of AI.</p>\n<p><strong>This project plan: build a virtual AI teacher image and run the DIKWP social intelligence model internally. In the teaching process, the teacher's AI infers the status of each student in real time through the students' facial expressions and answering questions: Purpose</strong>, identify which students are eager to challenge more difficult and which need basic explanation; <strong>In terms of ethics</strong>, when students are found to be cheating or conflicting, AI teachers implement pre-set ethical intervention strategies (such as emphasizing the importance of integrity or advocating the spirit of mutual assistance); <strong>In terms of emotion</strong>, the AI teacher will slow down the tone, give encouragement, and may adjust the teaching plan to reduce the difficulty when detecting that individual students show frustrated expressions due to repeated mistakes, so as to prevent them from losing confidence. Virtual student agents have different parameters (diligent, naughty, etc.) to test the adaptability of AI teachers. AI teachers need to coordinate the interaction between real and virtual students, such as when a naughty virtual student interjects and causes trouble, the AI teacher politely but firmly stops them, and takes the opportunity to guide the class to discuss the topic of discipline or respect for others, so as to achieve a subtle and silent moral education.</p>\n<p>Argument: By comparing the experimental class (with AI teachers) and the ordinary class, we will evaluate the learning effect and the change in students' moral character. It is expected that AI teachers will be able to significantly improve the degree of personalization of teaching, improve learning performance, and contribute to the aspect of invisible moral education (e.g., students are more willing to cooperate, and the cheating rate is reduced). In particular, we pay attention to whether AI teachers respond appropriately to unexpected situations (disputes, mistakes) in the classroom, and ensure that AI's moral judgments are in line with human teacher norms. If successful, the scenario will demonstrate the feasibility of brain-inspired social intelligence in the field of education, showing how AI teaching assistants can both teach and educate.</p>\n<p>The above three scenarios cover the representative fields of human-machine and machine-machine interaction, and verify the role of this project technology in improving the social adaptability and credibility of AI. These application demonstrations also lay the foundation for subsequent industrialization.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Three-year-research-plan-and-phases\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Three-year-research-plan-and-phases\" title=\"Three-year research plan and phases\"></a><strong>Three-year research plan and phases</strong></h1><p>The implementation period of the project is planned to be three years (2025.7-2028.6), and it <strong>will be carried out in three stages: basic theoretical breakthrough, key technology research, and system integration demonstration, and each stage will focus on tasks and milestone goals as follows</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 (Year 1, 2025.7–2026.6): Theoretical framework and prototype building</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Task 1: Improve the design of the DIKWP semantic model.

In view of the shortcomings of the prototype in the first year, a data-driven method was introduced to optimize the performance of each module: adversarial training and inverse reinforcement learning were used to improve the generalization of purpose reasoning, and human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) was introduced to optimize moral decision-making, so that the empathy response parameters were automatically adjusted by simulating user feedback. Expand the training data (including simulated interaction logs and public datasets) to improve the robustness of each algorithm. Output: Upgraded algorithm module, performance improvement report.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Task 5: Development of multi-agent collaboration mechanism. The extended simulation platform supports multi-agent parallel interaction and communication. Implement inter-agent semantic communication protocols and collaboration strategies, including</strong> purpose negotiation, task assignment, and conflict resolution. Ensure that the agent has some adversarial capability in a non-cooperative environment (e.g., in the event that an individual agent does not comply with the protocol). Output: multi-agent interaction module code, collaborative mechanism test report.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Task 6: System integration and verification of medium-complexity scenarios</strong>. The optimized Purpose, Morality, and Empathy modules are integrated into each agent to realize the social intelligence system of N agents. Two scenarios (e.g., social robotics and education) were selected for mesoscale verification: for example, 3 robots interacted with 3 simulated elderly people to complete the task; Or an AI teacher interacting with several students. Evaluate the stability and performance of the system in a multiplayer environment. Output: System integration version V2.0, scenario test data and analysis report.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Task 7: Self-explanatory and safety mechanism improvement. Develop decision-making process records and natural language interpretation generation components, collect interpretation cases in scenario validation, ask domain experts to evaluate the accuracy and comprehensibility of explanations, and iteratively improve the algorithm. At the same time, the security sandbox is improved to enforce the correction strategy for detected unethical or abnormal behaviors. Output: Interpret module code, interpret quality assessment report, security mechanism test report.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Milestone 2 (June 2027): The multi-agent DIKWP system is fully functional and exhibits significant social intelligence characteristics in typical scenarios: 80% of the Purpose recognition ≥accuracy, 75% of the ethical decision-making agreement rate with human experts≥≥ and 85% of the empathy response rate (according to the user questionnaire score). The success rate of multi-agent cooperative tasks is ≥30% higher than that of the baseline without social intelligence.

Background and significance\"></a><strong>1. Background and significance</strong></h1><p><strong>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):</strong> Autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in social communication, language development, and stereotyped repetitive behaviors. According to the latest statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the global incidence of autism has reached about 2.3% (i.e., 1 in 44 children). A large number of children with autism have severe impairments in social interaction, emotional communication, and cognitive development, and about 70% of individuals with autism are unable to live independently throughout their lives. Autism not only brings a heavy psychological and economic burden to the patient's family, but also puts great pressure on social and public resources. It is estimated that annual spending on special education, care and care related to autism will climb to $5.5 trillion by 2060. In view of the high incidence of autism and the resulting burden on families and society, countries have listed overcoming autism as a major public health and scientific and technological strategic need, and there is an urgent need to develop new technologies to improve the quality of life of people with autism.</p>\n<p><strong>National Strategic Needs and Scientific Research Frontiers:</strong> In China, the early screening, diagnosis and intervention of autism are also facing great challenges. At present, clinical practice mainly relies on empirical scale assessment and behavioral observation, with strong subjective factors, lagging diagnosis, and lack of professional resources in rural and underdeveloped areas, and many children miss the golden period of early intervention. With the advancement of major national projects such as \"brain science and brain-like research\", <strong>the mechanism research and the development of new diagnosis and treatment technologies for developmental disorders, especially autism, have been listed as one of the priority areas. The international trend of autism research shows that it is necessary to integrate multidisciplinary methods to tackle key problems in the whole chain from genetic molecules to neural circuits to behavioral cognition. Specifically, on the one hand,</strong> <strong>brain imaging and neuromodulation</strong> <strong>technologies have revealed that patients with autism have abnormal connections in brain regions related to social cognition, such as the dysfunction of social brain networks (including the medial prefrontal lobe, temporoparietal symphysis, amygdala, etc.) is closely related to social impairment. On the other hand, hundreds of genetic variants have been found to be associated with autism susceptibility, but a single gene often has limited contributions, and the genetic mechanism of autism is highly complex. Therefore, how to associate genes, neural circuits, and cognitive behaviors across scales has become an urgent scientific problem to be solved. In addition, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology provides new ideas for auxiliary diagnosis and behavioral intervention of autism. In recent years, a large number of studies have attempted to use machine learning models to identify autism markers from brain images or behavioral videos. In particular, multimodal deep learning fusion technology is being used to extract complex correlation features in order to improve diagnostic accuracy. However, most of the current AI diagnostic models are still limited to a single level of data-driven</strong>, lacking an explanation of the nature of cognitive deficits in autism, and belong to a typical \"black box\" model. Internationally, there is a growing need for explainable and controllable AI-powered diagnostic tools. To sum up, the development of a <strong>new theoretical and technical framework that can connect multiple levels of genes, brains and cognition is not only an international frontier trend, but also a strategic need at the national level.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Originality and theoretical value of the DIKWP model:</strong> In the face of the above challenges, Professor Duan Yucong proposed the DIKWP model with independent intellectual property rights, which provides a new paradigm for the cognitive modeling of complex intelligent systems. \"DIKWP\" stands for Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom-Purpose, which is based on the traditional DIKW (pyramid model: data, information, knowledge, wisdom) and adds an original \"intention/purpose\" layer. The model adopts a mesh interaction architecture, which breaks the limitation of linear hierarchy, so that the semantics of each level can be fed back and updated in both directions. The core idea of this design is that by explicitly introducing purposiveness into the cognitive system, machine intelligence can have a rudimentary form of \"self-awareness\", capable of self-monitoring, self-reflection, and regulation of cognitive processes. The DIKWP model is an academic milestone and is regarded as an innovative way to solve the \"black box\" problem of artificial intelligence and improve the interpretability and controllability of AI systems. \"The DIKWP model builds a common cognitive language for human institutions, so that every step of the AI decision can be traced, interpreted, and understood by humans. By embedding the key layer of 'purpose' into the model, we are not only making AI smarter, but also ensuring that it remains in service of human values and security needs.\" “。 At present, the model and its related artificial consciousness theory have obtained 114 domestic and foreign invention patents (including 15 PCT international patents). The DIKWP model has shown great potential in the fields of cognitive computing and artificial consciousness systems, such as building an interpretable cognitive operating system, and dismantling large model reasoning into five monitorable links: data, information, knowledge, wisdom, and intention, so as to ensure that each step of AI output can be traced. These achievements have attracted wide attention around the world, making DIKWP a new vane for AI explainability and security research. It can be seen that DIKWP represents the cutting-edge theory of independent innovation in China, and has the world's leading originality in intelligent cognitive modeling.</p>\n<p><strong>New significance of the DIKWP model for autism research:</strong> The introduction of the DIKWP model into the study of autism is expected to reconstruct and expand the traditional research path of autism, and provide a new perspective for revealing the mechanism of social cognitive deficits in autism. The core obstacle of people with autism is the perception and understanding of social information, that is, the inability to effectively extract data/information from other people's behaviors <strong>and rise to social knowledge</strong>and then infer the intentions and purposes of others (which is the lack of \"theoretical psychology\" (ToM) ability). This is highly consistent with the deficits of functions at all levels of the DIKWP model: children with autism often show abnormal perception of social stimuli (such as facial expressions and eye contact), and it is difficult to obtain correct information from sensory data in time (such as identifying emotional expressions); They also have barriers to semantic comprehension and situational reasoning (knowledge to intelligence), and are unable to integrate scattered information into knowledge or strategies for social situations; Most notably, they have difficulty guessing the intentions/purposes of others, i.e., deficiencies in social intelligence and mental understanding, which is the ability represented by \"Purpose\" at the top level of the DIKWP model. Therefore, the DIKWP model provides a systematic framework for analyzing why autistic patients have functional deviations at different cognitive levels: we can treat autism as a cross-level cognitive processing disorder coupled neural circuit abnormality, and use DIKWP to characterize this coupling relationship. This convergence of theories is expected to answer several key questions in autism research, such as: How are abnormalities in sensory input progressively amplified into high-level social cognitive deficits? How does damage to specific circuits of the brain, such as those responsible for facial recognition or empathy, affect the transformation of information into knowledge and intelligence? How does the lack of social motivation (lack of social intention) manifest itself at the brain and behavioral level? These are all scientific topics that DIKWP can focus on.</p>\n<p><strong>Importance of this project:</strong> Based on the above background, the theme of this project is \"Research on the Neural Mechanism and Gene Editing Therapy of Autism Integrating DIKWP Model**\", aiming to create a new research paradigm of autism guided by artificial consciousness. This will comprehensively enhance China's original innovation ability in the field of basic research and clinical intervention for autism, and open up a new path for the integration of brain science and artificial intelligence. The significance of the project is embodied in the following aspects:** (1) <strong>Theoretical innovation</strong>: Introduce the DIKWP artificial consciousness model into the study of the social cognitive mechanism of autism, fill the gap of cross-level integration theory, and enrich the application theory of artificial intelligence in brain diseases; (2) <strong>Technological breakthroughs</strong>: build a technical chain of \"perception-knowledge-expression\" to realize the closed-loop from the patient's perception layer (neural signals, behavioral data) to the knowledge layer (cognitive state modeling) to the expression layer (clinical decision-making, intervention plan), and improve the intelligent and accurate level of autism diagnosis and treatment; (3) <strong>Practical value</strong>: to develop interpretable multimodal AI-assisted diagnosis systems and novel gene editing treatment strategies to meet the urgent clinical needs for early objective diagnosis and effective intervention, and improve the prognosis and quality of life of children with autism; (4) <strong>Strategic effect</strong>: To create a research platform for artificial awareness of autism and a new paradigm of intelligent diagnosis and treatment, to help China produce a number of landmark achievements with international influence in the field of brain-intelligence intersection, to serve national strategies such as \"Healthy China 2030\", and to provide reference for the research of other neurodevelopmental diseases, which has significant social and economic benefits.</p>\n<p>To sum up, this project closely combines the national strategic needs, international frontier trends and the original theoretical advantages of Professor Duan Yucong's team in our university, and is expected to achieve a breakthrough in the field of autism mechanism and treatment, and promote China to enter the global leading ranks in the new generation of artificial intelligence + brain science integration research.</p>\n<h1 id=\"2-Research-objectives-and-overall-technical-roadmap\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-Research-objectives-and-overall-technical-roadmap\" title=\"2. Research objectives and overall technical roadmap\"></a><strong>2. Research objectives and overall technical roadmap</strong></h1><p><strong>Overall Objectives:</strong> The overall goal of this project is to construct a cross-level research framework that integrates the DIKWP model to comprehensively and deeply study the pathogenesis and potential treatment pathways of autism from neural circuits, cognitive processes to interventions. By introducing the hierarchical cognitive architecture of the DIKWP model, we hope to elucidate the coupling relationship between core brain circuit abnormalities and information-knowledge processing process disorders in patients with autism**, develop a new multimodal diagnosis technology based on artificial consciousness, and explore the feasibility of gene editing in autism intervention. Specifically, the project seeks to achieve the following key objectives:**</p>\n<p><strong>Objective 1: To uncover the \"perception-cognition\" coupling law of the neural mechanism of autism. <strong>The DIKWP model was used to model the abnormal connection of multiple brain regions in patients with autism, analyze how impaired sensory data</strong>/information processing leads to defects in the formation of high-level knowledge/wisdom, and elucidate the neural circuit basis of social cognitive disorders in autism. The focus is to find the correspondence between abnormalities in the brain's core circuits</strong> (e.g., social brain networks, mirror neuron systems, etc.) and cognitive deficits (e.g., emotional perception, language comprehension, intentional reasoning disorders).</p>\n<p><strong>Objective 2: Develop a multimodal AI diagnosis system</strong> **based on DIKWP artificial consciousness. **Design an artificial intelligence diagnostic model that integrates the hierarchical semantics of \"data-information-knowledge-intelligence-intention\", and integrates multimodal information such as clinical assessment, behavioral video, brain imaging and genetic data. Realize the early automatic identification of autism, make the diagnosis process transparent and explainable, and trace the basis of AI decision-making, so as to improve the accuracy and credibility of diagnosis and make up for the shortcomings of traditional manual assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>Goal 3: To explore new targets and strategies for gene editing therapy for autism. <strong>Based on the in-depth understanding of the cognitive circuit of autism and the simulation and prediction of the artificial consciousness model, the possible key genetic</strong>/molecular targets</strong> were screened out using <strong>CRISPR/Cas9</strong>and other gene editing technologies have been validated in cells and animal models. To evaluate the effect of correcting these genetic defects on neural circuit activity and behavioral phenotypes to provide a potential underlying treatment for autism. Particular attention is paid to molecules that regulate the flow of information at various layers of the DIKWP model, such as signaling pathways that affect synaptic plasticity (data/information processing level) or social motivation and cognitive flexibility (intelligence/intention level).</p>\n<p>**Goal 4: To build an integrated platform for autism assessment and intervention driven by artificial awareness. **The above research results are integrated and applied to clinical practice, and an intelligent system including AI diagnosis, cognitive function assessment and personalized intervention recommendations is built. The system was deployed in actual medical and rehabilitation scenarios to evaluate cognitive abnormalities and monitor the effect of intervention in children with autism, and verify its effectiveness and practicability. Finally, a new paradigm of artificial intelligence diagnosis and treatment of autism that can be promoted will be formed, laying the foundation for its application nationwide in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Overall technical route:</strong> In order to achieve the above goals, this project adopts the <em>overall technical route of \"traditional path + DIKWP empowerment</em>\", that is, the classic \"three links\" in autism research**: neural circuit mechanism**, <strong>AI-assisted diagnosis</strong>, and <strong>gene therapy exploration</strong>——The DIKWP model is introduced as a guiding framework throughout the whole process, and a \"perception-knowledge-expression\" connected technology chain from basic mechanism to clinical transformation is established. Figure 1 (omitted) illustrates the overall scheme of the project.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we divide our work into four levels that are connected to each other: (1) <strong>Perception layer (data-information layer):</strong> focus on the collection of physiological and behavioral data of patients with autism, including brain imaging, EEG, gene sequencing, cognitive testing, and social behavior video. Through signal processing and feature extraction, massive raw data is transformed into meaningful information representations, such as brain functional connectivity matrices, behavioral coding indicators, mutant gene lists, etc. (2) <strong>Knowledge layer (knowledge-wisdom layer):</strong> Based on the DIKWP cognitive architecture, the aforementioned information is fused and high-level semantic modeling is carried out to construct a knowledge graph or cognitive computing model that reflects the cognitive state of autism. Here, we use artificial consciousness algorithms to further abstract information into knowledge (e.g., identify specific deficit patterns in the patient's emotion recognition, language comprehension, etc.), and make inferences at the intelligence layer (e.g., synthesize multiple defects to infer the overall diagnostic conclusion). The two-way feedback properties of the DIKWP model will also be used to simulate cognitive adjustment processes within patients, such as predicting how high-level cognition adjusts when underlying sensory input changes. (3) <strong>Expression layer (intent/application layer):</strong> This is the output link of the technology chain, which involves applying the results of cognitive models to the expression of diagnostic decisions and intervention strategies. On the one hand, the developed AI diagnostic system will give an interpretable diagnosis report, including various layers of basis (data anomalies, information characteristics, knowledge reasoning, intelligent decision-making, and potential intention analysis) for clinicians to refer to for decision-making. On the other hand, in terms of intervention, this layer will output potential therapeutic targets and suggestions for individuals (for example, the abnormality of a certain gene function has a significant impact on their ability to reason about their intentions, it is recommended to consider corresponding drugs/gene therapies), and then act on the upper layer research as feedback to verify the model prediction. Through the close connection of these three layers, we have formed a closed-loop research route: from perceptual acquisition of data, to cognitive modeling at the knowledge layer, to the application of expression results, and in turn to test and optimize the model.</p>\n<p>It is worth emphasizing that the DIKWP model is not simply attached to the above processes, but is deeply integrated into each link, leading the research ideas and technical realization: in the study of neural mechanisms, it helps us design experimental paradigms across brain regions and functional levels; In the AI model, it is directly used as the architecture blueprint to determine the division and interaction of algorithm modules. In genetic and clinical applications, it guides us to screen targets and design evaluation indicators from the perspective of cognitive function. Therefore, DIKWP provides a unified semantic coordinate system and logical thread to ensure that each module has its own focus but is interconnected, and ultimately serves the overall goal of revealing and intervening in autism.</p>\n<p><strong>Innovative approaches versus traditional research:</strong> Traditional approaches to autism research tend to work in silos—neuroscientists focus on brain abnormalities, AI experts develop diagnostic tools, and geneticists search for genes, but these efforts lack a unified framework. In contrast, the technical route after the introduction of the DIKWP model in this project has three innovative features: one is hierarchical connectivity, we use the three stages of perception-knowledge-expression to connect the basic and clinical, so that abnormal brain activity can explain its behavioral consequences through the cognitive model, and can be directly used to guide the selection of intervention targets. The second is model-driven, the DIKWP model provides an embedded purposeful agent architecture, so that AI diagnosis is no longer an empirical pattern classification, but an active intelligence with human-like cognitive processes, sustainable learning and self-optimization. The third is closed-loop validation, in which gene editing experiments provide validation feedback for model prediction, and the model can be adaptively adjusted according to the experimental results (such as modifying the knowledge graph), forming a combination of data-driven and mechanism-driven cycles. This new paradigm will greatly improve the explanatory power and relevance of research: for every brain connectivity abnormality found, we can immediately assess how it disrupts the flow of information; For each proposed intervention, we can predict its impact on cognitive circuitry through the model. This ensures that the results are both theoretical and practical.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the overall technical route of this project is guided by the DIKWP artificial consciousness model, and runs through all links of \"mechanism research-diagnostic model-treatment exploration-clinical validation\", forming an interdisciplinary cross-integration, evidence-based iterative optimization model. This route is closely related to the pain points of autism research, and will provide solid support for breaking through the bottleneck of autism cognitive mechanism and intervention.</p>\n<h1 id=\"3-Research-content-and-key-modules\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-Research-content-and-key-modules\" title=\"3. Research content and key modules\"></a><strong>3. Research content and key modules</strong></h1><p>Focusing on the above goals and technical routes, this project has set up four research content modules, which correspond to different levels of autism research. In each module, we will integrate the ideas and methods of the DIKWP model to form several key technological breakthroughs. The modules and their main research contents are as follows:</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-1-Modeling-of-autism-neural-mechanisms-perceptual-layer-information-knowledge-mapping\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-1-Modeling-of-autism-neural-mechanisms-perceptual-layer-information-knowledge-mapping\" title=\"3.1 Modeling of autism neural mechanisms (perceptual layer &amp; information-knowledge mapping)\"></a><strong>3.1 Modeling of autism neural mechanisms (perceptual layer &amp; information-knowledge mapping)</strong></h2><p><strong>Overview:</strong> This module focuses on the modeling of brain structure and functional abnormalities in autism, and aims to reconstruct the mapping relationship between multi-brain region connectivity and cognitive deficits in combination with the DIKWP model. We will systematically collect multimodal brain data from patients with autism and typical developmental populations, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (<strong>fMRI),</strong> <strong>resting-state EEG/MEG</strong>, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), etc., to quantify brain network topological differences and information transfer efficiency. At the same time, the DIKWP model is introduced to link the data of these neural \"perception layers\" with higher-level \"knowledge/intelligence\" functions to explain how specific brain circuit abnormalities lead to cognitive impairment.</p>\n<p><strong>Key scientific questions:</strong> The neural mechanism of autism can be summarized as the loss of information between the underlying processing processes such as sensation, attention, memory, and emotion, and the high-level functions such as social cognition. We will focus on the following scientific questions:</p>\n<p>*(1) How does abnormal functional connectivity in multiple brain regions affect information processing? *Autism research has shown that long-term brain connections tend to be weakened and local connections may be too strong, the so-called \"brain malconnection\" theory. We intend to examine the patterns of impaired information flow transmission between different regions in social cognition-related networks (e.g., default mode network (DMN) and social cognitive network, and how this impairment corresponds to the failure of social information integration. From the perspective of DIKWP, we hypothesize that autistic people may not be able to effectively transmit key signals to higher-order regions due to abnormal sensory filtering or attentional selection mechanisms at the \"data → information\" level, resulting in incomplete representation at the subsequent \"knowledge\" level. For example, fMRI was used to construct a whole-brain functional connectivity map, and the information mediation degree of each node was measured in combination with Graph theory, so as to find the information convergence hub that was significantly reduced in the autism group, so as to locate the key loops that led to the interruption of information flow.</p>\n<p>*(2) How are cognitive deficits represented in brain networks? *Cognitive deficits in autism include social perception (facial expressions and eye perception), <strong>emotion recognition</strong>, <strong>language comprehension, and executive function</strong>(planning, flexibility) and other aspects. We will design a series of cognitive tasks (such as facial emotion recognition tasks, virtual social interaction tasks, etc.) combined with fMRI to observe the differences in brain activation and changes in network collaboration patterns in patients with autism when completing these tasks. With the DIKWP model, we will map different task requirements to cognitive levels: for example, face emotion recognition involves more processing of \"information → knowledge\" (from visual features to semantic emotional concepts), while intentional reasoning tasks involve more processing of \"knowledge → intelligence/intention\" (inferring the purpose of others from known cues). Comparing the similarities and differences between the brain activity pathways of autism and control groups under these tasks can reveal the dysfunction of autism at specific DIKWP levels. For example, if the prefrontal-temporoparietal node synergy is significantly reduced in the autistic group when reasoning about the intentions of others, this will confirm the \"intelligence/intention\" layer processing disorder and can be related to the degree of theoretical psychological deficits assessed by clinical assessment.</p>\n<p>*and (3) multi-scale unified characterization of neural circuit abnormalities. *Abnormalities in the brain can be described at multiple scales (molecular/cellular, local circuits, whole-brain networks). We plan to construct a multi-scale brain <strong>connection-cognitive map</strong>: the upper nodes represent cognitive functional units (such as emotion recognition module and language comprehension module), the lower nodes represent anatomical structures (brain regions and neural circuits), and the two layers are connected by functional mapping (quantitative calculation of mapping strength based on experimental data). This two-layer map is similar to the hierarchy of the DIKWP model, and can be regarded as the implementation of the DIKWP framework in the neural dimension, where the lower-level biological network realizes the upper-layer cognitive function. By comparing the topological differences in autism and control profiles, we will identify autism-specific key connectivity deletions or abnormal connectivity increases. For example, if it is found that the functional node of \"eye contact perception\" in the autism atlas is weakly connected with the subordinate occipital visual cortex node, it indicates that the transmission of visual perception to social cognition is impaired (the disconnection between the perceptual layer and the knowledge layer). This map can also be used in conjunction with the genetic module to indicate which autism risk genes each edge may be subject to (detailed in Section 3.3) to provide guidance for subsequent interventions.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Methods and Technical Roadmap:</strong> In order to achieve the above goals, this module will comprehensively use a variety of brain imaging analysis and computational modeling techniques</p>\n<p>In terms of data acquisition, we cooperated with clinical hospitals to recruit a large sample of autistic children and matched healthy controls, and collected high temporal resolution (EEG/MEG) and high spatial resolution (fMRI, DTI) data, as well as neuropsychological evaluation results. Data acquisition for children with autism will focus on reducing motor artifacts and improving task cooperation, such as using a gamified fMRI task paradigm to improve child cooperation.</p>\n<p>In terms of signal analysis, functional connection analysis, <strong>independent component analysis (ICA),</strong> spectrum <strong>analysis and other methods were used to extract the neural features of each modality. For example, the resting state and task state functional connectivity matrices were extracted from fMRI, the EEG power spectrum and phase coupling indexes were extracted from EEG, and the white matter fiber bundle connection map was reconstructed from DTI.</strong></p>\n<p>In terms of DIKWP integration, a cognitive graph construction algorithm was developed: each subject was represented as a multi-layer network by combining brain connectivity features and cognitive test/task performance. Among them, the <strong>underlying network nodes are brain regions and pathways (according to anatomical or functional distinctions, such as visual, auditory, social brain regions, etc.), and the upper network nodes are cognitive function units (defined according to test items, such as emotion recognition, working memory, language comprehension, etc.). The upper and lower layers are connected by edges, and the weights are represented by the contribution of the brain region to the corresponding cognitive function (learning from the data can be achieved through machine learning regression models or structural equation models).</strong></p>\n<p>Group comparison and model discovery: The cognitive graphs of the autism group and the control group were compared, the differences were quantified by graph theory indicators (clustering coefficient, between-centrality, etc.), and the community detection algorithm was used to find abnormal connection clusters. It is expected to find a decoupling of specific modules in the autism group, such as loose connections within the social cognitive module, or weak connections between the sensory-cognitive layers.</p>\n<p>DIKWP simulation verification: A computer simulation model (such as a neural network model) is constructed based on the obtained graphs to simulate the transmission process of information from the sensory layer through the knowledge layer to the decision-making layer. The simulation model of autistic people was simulated by intervention (such as strengthening a virtual connection or introducing noise at a specific node) to observe the impact on the output behavior, and theoretically verified the causal relationship of how a certain circuit abnormality leads to cognitive deficits. Such simulations provide a hypothetical basis for subsequent genetic or neuromodulation experiments.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Results:</strong> This module will produce a series of high-resolution brain network maps and cognitive mapping models on the neural mechanisms of autism. It is expected to theoretically put forward new evidence for the hypothesis of \"autism information processing circuit loss\", and find several key neural pathways, whose dysfunction directly leads to the blockage of the transformation of information into knowledge in the DIKWP hierarchy. In terms of data, the world's first multi-scale brain connection-cognitive database for autism integrating the concept of DIKWP was constructed to realize the full observation and description of the autism brain network. In terms of methodology, a new method of integrating brain network and knowledge graph has been developed, which sets a model for the study of cross-level brain disease mechanisms. The results of this module will not only serve the follow-up AI diagnosis and gene intervention module (providing key features and targets), but will also be published in the form of papers to enhance China's international influence in the field of cognitive neuroscience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-2-Multimodal-AI-assisted-diagnosis-Knowledge-Layer-Intelligence-Purpose-Artificial-Consciousness-Diagnosis-Network\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-2-Multimodal-AI-assisted-diagnosis-Knowledge-Layer-Intelligence-Purpose-Artificial-Consciousness-Diagnosis-Network\" title=\"3.2 Multimodal AI-assisted diagnosis (Knowledge Layer &amp; Intelligence-Purpose Artificial Consciousness Diagnosis Network)\"></a><strong>3.2 Multimodal AI-assisted diagnosis (Knowledge Layer &amp; Intelligence-Purpose Artificial Consciousness Diagnosis Network)</strong></h2><p><strong>Overview:</strong> This module focuses on the construction of a multimodal artificial intelligence autism diagnosis system, making full use of the information-knowledge-intelligence hierarchical structure of the DIKWP model, and developing an artificial consciousness diagnosis network with stronger interpretability and flexible adaptability. The system will integrate the patient's multi-source data (including clinical questionnaires, behavioral videos, voice patterns, eye movements, EEG/fMRI features, genetic information, etc.), and automatically determine whether an individual belongs to the autism spectrum and give a basis for diagnosis through hierarchical feature extraction and cognitive reasoning. This module seeks to break through the bottleneck of existing AI diagnosis, so that model decision-making is no longer an incomprehensible black box, but can simulate human cognitive processes, so that doctors and parents can be convinced of their conclusions.</p>\n<p><strong>Key innovations and difficulties:</strong> The difficulty of multimodal AI diagnosis lies in the fact that different types of data have different scales, non-linear correlations, and limited and heterogeneous sample data. The innovation of this module lies in the introduction of the DIKWP artificial consciousness architecture, which disassembles the diagnostic process into step-by-step reasoning similar to human cognition: from the perception of raw data, to the understanding of intermediate semantic information, to high-level knowledge and intelligent decision-making, and finally to the calibration results combined with diagnostic intent. Specific innovations include:</p>\n<p><strong>(1) Hierarchical feature extraction and semantic mapping:</strong> We will design a multi-level deep learning model, and the first layer will process the raw data of each modality to realize the underlying feature extraction (corresponding to the data/information layer of DIKWP). For example, convolutional neural networks extract micro-expression features in facial videos, speech models extract speech tone features, and graph neural networks process brain connection matrix features. The second-layer model maps these extracted information features to intermediate semantic representations, such as fusing video and audio features to judge the quality of social interactions, and correlating EEG features to cognitive states (attention levels, mood swings, etc.). This layer is equivalent to the knowledge layer construction of DIKWP, we will refer to the knowledge graph or expert experience, assign interpretable semantic labels to the middle nodes of the model (such as \"low frequency of eye contact\", \"single intonation\", etc.), and track which original features contribute the most to these intermediate conclusions through attention mechanism or saliency analysis techniques to enhance interpretability.</p>\n<p><strong>(2) Artificial Consciousness Decision-making Network:</strong> At the senior level, we will build an artificial consciousness decision-making module with metacognitive capabilities. This module is equivalent to the intelligence and purpose layer of the DIKWP model, which is responsible for synthesizing various intermediate semantic evidence, making diagnostic inferences, and conducting self-assessment and adjustment. We will draw on the \"dual circulation\" architecture proposed by Professor Duan Yucong: that is, in addition to the basic cognitive process (feature → discrimination), a metacognitive cycle is added. The basic process outputs a preliminary diagnosis (e.g., autism score), and the metacognitive loop monitors whether this output is consistent with the purpose built into the system. The \"purpose\" here refers to the human expert diagnostic criteria and social value that the model internalizes at the time of training: for example, avoiding over-diagnosis or missing a diagnosis. By checking the credibility of each step in the inference chain (data→ information→ knowledge → decision-making), the metacognitive module can trigger self-adjustment mechanisms if a step is found to be highly uncertain or unfit for purpose (e.g., a key sign is diagnosed without being explained): for example, requesting more data, adjusting the weight of a feature, or suggesting a referral to an expert for re-evaluation by giving an \"uncertain\" conclusion. This mechanism simulates the reflection process in human diagnosis, making AI systems more robust and safe. Our model will use reinforcement learning or generative adversarial training to allow the metacognitive module to learn to avoid bias while maintaining accurate diagnosis, and truly realize \"intelligent self-knowledge\".</p>\n<p><strong>(3) Interpretable presentation of diagnostic results: The final output of the</strong> system is not only a simple \"positive/negative\" judgment, but also a detailed interpretable report. We will design a natural language generation module that transforms the reasoning process inside the model into a human-readable report. The report may include: primary data characteristics (e.g., \"the child spent only 30% of the normal mean fixation on the face\"), intermediate inferences (\"this suggests a significant lack of social attention\"), a comprehensive analysis (\"combined with the monotony of the voice and repetitive behavior, indicating a social communication disorder\"), as well as confidence and possible sources of error. The report also provides recommendations for next steps (e.g., \"Genetic testing is recommended to check for Fragile X syndrome\" or \"Social training is recommended\") that are rooted in the model's \"intent\" layer knowledge base (trained from expert experience). Through this intelligent assistant-like interpretation report, doctors are able to understand the AI decision-making logic and adjust the diagnostic strategy accordingly. Parents can also get clear feedback on what their child's problems are and why, and improve acceptance of the diagnosis. The introduction of explainability will greatly promote the reliable application of AI diagnosis in clinical scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Methods and Implementation Steps: The</strong> implementation of this module will go through three stages: model design, training validation, and clinical testing</p>\n<p><em>Model design:</em> Based on repeated discussions with clinical experts, the list of modalities and features that need to be integrated into the diagnostic system is determined, and the model module structure is divided based on DIKWP. Based on the results of module 3.1 mentioned above, the neural features (such as specific brain network connectivity indicators) and cognitive and behavioral features that are most valuable for diagnosis were extracted and included in the model input. Then, a modular design method is used to build a multi-branch neural network: each data mode corresponds to a network branch to extract low-level features, and then perform feature fusion and semantic mapping in the middle layer. In order to add a metacognitive unit to the high-level decision-making part, a mechanism needs to be designed to measure the deviation between the decision and the purpose, and we consider using a probabilistic graph model or a Bayesian network to model the inference chain to calculate the uncertainty.</p>\n<p><em>Model training:</em> Leverage large-scale data for model training and tuning. The data sources include clinical data collected by the project itself, as well as open data obtained in cooperation with domestic and foreign autism databases. In the training process, in order to solve the problems of multimodal fusion and small shots, we will introduce strategies such as transfer learning and federated learning: for example, each branch network is pre-trained on the relevant tasks of large samples to master the preliminary feature extraction ability, and then the joint training model is fine-tuned on the data of this project. At the same time, we should pay attention to interpretable regularization, and add to the loss function to encourage the accurate prediction of interpretable semantics by the middle layer of the model (such as predicting clinical scale scores at the same time). The model structure is continuously improved by using the data annotated by experts to verify whether the interpretation of the model output is in line with medical knowledge (e.g., checking whether the area of interest of the Attention mechanism is a face).</p>\n<p><em>Model Validation and Clinical Testing:</em> In offline validation, we will use multiple evaluation indicators: <strong>diagnostic accuracy</strong> (including sensitivity and specificity), <strong>model stability</strong> (performance in different data cases), and <strong>interpretability</strong> scores (Clinical experts are invited to score according to the report) and so on, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the model. This was then piloted in a real-world clinical setting: in collaboration with the autism diagnosis centers of partner hospitals, our AI systems were embedded in their diagnostic processes. Based on the routine assessment, the doctor refers to the AI report to record the consistency of the important findings provided by the AI with the final diagnosis, and whether the AI helped the doctor find clues that were overlooked. Through prospective trials of a certain scale of cases, the utility and reliability of the system in the real environment were verified, and feedback from doctors was collected to iteratively improve the model.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Results:</strong> The direct result of this module will be a multimodal diagnostic AI system for autism with independent intellectual property rights (presented in the form of software), and its performance is expected to exceed the level reported in existing studies. In terms of technical indicators, it is expected that the diagnostic accuracy rate can reach more than 90% in the test set we collect, which is significantly higher than that of traditional methods. In particular, early screening of young children under 2 years of age is expected to increase sensitivity by at least 20% compared with current questionnaire methods. More importantly, we have improved the explainability of the quantitative display system: for example, the AI report has been proved to be more than 80% consistent with human professional understanding through expert scoring, which is significantly better than the black box model without the DIKWP architecture. This achievement will be published in the form of a paper or invention patent, which will establish our leading position in the field of AI-assisted autism diagnosis and promote the standardized application of AI in the field of mental health.</p>\n<p>In addition, as an application demonstration of artificial consciousness theory, the system will verify the effectiveness of the DIKWP model in practical complex tasks, which has important academic value. The diagnostic reports and intermediate analysis data generated by the system will also be fed back into the basic research module to help us better understand the characteristic patterns and underlying mechanisms of autism. In conclusion, this module will produce a set of practical and advanced intelligent diagnostic tools, which will provide the possibility for the early detection and intervention of autism, and alleviate the dilemma of insufficient clinical diagnosis resources to a certain extent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-3-Gene-Editing-and-Therapeutic-Validation-Intelligence-Layer-Gene-Loop-Cognitive-Feedback\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-3-Gene-Editing-and-Therapeutic-Validation-Intelligence-Layer-Gene-Loop-Cognitive-Feedback\" title=\"3.3 Gene Editing and Therapeutic Validation (Intelligence Layer &amp;; Gene-Loop-Cognitive Feedback)\"></a><strong>3.3 Gene Editing and Therapeutic Validation (Intelligence Layer &amp;; Gene-Loop-Cognitive Feedback)</strong></h2><p><strong>Overview:</strong> This module looks at the molecular and genetic aspects of autism and aims to explore the feasibility of using gene editing technology as an intervention. Based on the aforementioned studies of neural mechanisms and cognitive models, we will identify key genes/molecules that are highly associated with core deficits in autismand verify its causal effects through experiments at the cellular and animal levels. Furthermore, cutting-edge gene editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 were used to repair or regulate these genes to see if they could reverse the related neural circuit abnormalities and behavioral phenotypes. This module will transform the mechanistic cognition obtained from the artificial consciousness model into potential treatment strategies, realize the closed loop from theoretical prediction to experimental verification, and promote the extension of autism intervention methods from behavioral training to biomedical level.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Genetics studies of autism have identified hundreds of risk genes and several monogenic syndromes (e.g., Rett syndrome/MECP2, <strong>fragile X syndrome</strong>/FMR1, <strong>tuberous sclerosis</strong>). /TSC1/2, etc.). Most of these genes are involved in key pathways such as synaptic development, neural connectivity, and gene expression regulation, suggesting that autism is largely a synaptic disease or brain junction disease. With the maturity of gene editing technology, the treatment of brain diseases with single gene defects is emerging, such as gene therapy for ASD-associated Angelman syndrome (UBE3A gene inactivation). Therefore, it is reasonable to explore: for those genes that are highly related to social deficits in autism, can they be edited to correct the symptoms to alleviate the symptoms? The unique role of the DIKWP model here is to provide a basis for screening and interpretation: the model can reveal how certain genes disrupt information processing by affecting neural circuits. For example, if the model predicts that the loss of function of a synaptic protein gene (e.g., SHANK3) will result in \"inability to upload information from the perceptual layer to the knowledge layer\" (e.g., due to decreased neural signaling efficiency), then SHANK3 becomes an attractive target for intervention. Correspondingly, we will focus on genes that play a key role in the DIKWP process (e.g., molecular pathways involved in social memory, motivational drive: oxytocin, 5-HT; or genes involved in the balance of neural excitation/inhibition: SCN2A, GABA receptors, etc.).</p>\n<p><strong>Main research steps and contents:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(1) Screening candidate gene targets:</strong> Utilize the results of existing large-scale gene association studies and whole-exome/whole-genome sequencing data from our own samples to create a list of genes that are significantly associated with the autism phenotype (e.g., the top 50 genes with the highest autism risk scores). Combining the findings of modules 3.1 and 3.2, we mapped these genes to cognitive maps and brain networks to look for links where they may influence. For example, if a gene is highly expressed in the prefrontal lobe and is involved in synaptic plasticity, it is speculated that it affects the flexible decision-making function of the \"knowledge-wisdom\" layer. If a gene affects cerebellar development, it may be linked to sensory-motor coordination, which has an impact on the processing of \"data → information\". We will validate these inferences through literature review and bioinformatics analysis (gene function annotation, pathway enrichment analysis). Finally, a small number of key genes were selected as intervention candidates, and the following types were preferred: (1) <strong>single-gene mutations were clear</strong>: such as SHANK3 (Phelan-McDermid syndrome) or MECP2 (Rett), whose mutations lead to autism-like manifestations, and substitution/repair can theoretically play a role; (2) <strong>High-frequency risk genes</strong>: such as CHD8, SCN2A, etc., which have been repeatedly verified by multiple studies; (3) <strong>Druggable/editable targets</strong>: gene products are enzymes or receptors, which can be regulated by pharmacological means or gene editing methods, such as mTOR pathway genes, OXTR (oxytocin receptor), etc.</p>\n<p><strong>(2) Cell-level functional validation</strong>: For the key genes screened, we will first verify their effects on neuronal function and DIKWP cognitive processes in an in vitro model. On the one hand, the <strong>2D culture model of brain-like organoids or neurons obtained from the differentiation of patient-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) was used to record the abnormalities of the cells carrying candidate gene mutations, such as synaptic release, growth cone movement, and network electrical activity. On the other hand, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing is used to perform correction or knockout experiments at the cellular level: for example, the patient's mutated gene is corrected to a normal sequence to observe whether normal neuronal function is restored; or introduce the mutation into healthy control cells to see if the autism-related abnormalities are reproduced. Calcium imaging, patch-clamp, electrophysiological array and other techniques were used to measure the differences in neural activity patterns before and after editing. For example, CRISPR activation of normal allele expression in mouse neurons has been studied to compensate for the loss of function of SCN2A monoallelic inactivation. Similarly, we expect to see editing corrections of key genes that enhance neuronal excitability or synaptic maturation, thereby partially restoring</strong> the normal rhythm of \"data/information\" processing, laying the groundwork for further validation in animals.</p>\n<p><strong>(3) Gene therapy trials in animal models:</strong> Based on the positive results of cell validation, we will select appropriate animal models for higher-level therapy evaluation. For each candidate gene, there is usually a corresponding genetically engineered model mouse in the literature (e.g., Shank3 knockout mice exhibit social deficits; CNTNAP2 knock rats have autistic behavior, etc.). We will introduce these mouse models and confirm that their phenotypes are consistent with our expectations (e.g., decreased social interactions, increased repetitive behaviors, etc.) through behavioral testing. Subsequently, gene editing therapy strategies are designed to intervene in model mice, such as using AAV viral vectors to deliver the CRISPR system to specific regions of the brain to knock out genes that inhibit overactivity, or activate silencing alleles. Attention needs to be paid to controlling the specificity and safety of editing, and we will select validated high-fidelity Cas9 and suitable gRNA to avoid off-target effects. After the intervention, the mice were evaluated for improvement in core behaviors (time spent on social interaction, ultrasound vocal communication, number of stereotyped movements), as well as changes in brain electrophysiology and connectome. For example, if gene therapy is administered to Shank3-deficient mice, we expect to observe enhanced hippocampus-prefrontal synaptic transmission, increased social interest, etc. We also plan to use chemogenetics**/optogenetics to temporarily modulate the corresponding circuits to verify that the behavioral changes are indeed caused by the restoration of gene function—which is equivalent to a validation of the DIKWP model: when the data-information transfer of a certain loop is restored**, the corresponding cognitive function should be restored. If the results of animal experiments show that gene editing can significantly improve the symptoms of the model, it will lay the foundation for clinical human gene therapy in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>(4) DIKWP model feedback and mechanism interpretation:</strong> After obtaining the experimental data, we will use the DIKWP model to interpret the results before and after the intervention. For example, in animal experiments, we can collect brain functional imaging and behavioral data from mice before and after gene therapy, build corresponding cognitive maps, and compare changes in information flow indicators. If it is found that some key information flows (e.g., sensory input to the social cognition module) are restored, then this is consistent with the prediction of the DIKWP model, which strengthens the correctness of the model; Conversely, if there are unforeseen outcomes, it can prompt us to revise the model's hypotheses about the mechanism of action of the gene. In this way, the model and experiment are mutually validated and improved, and finally a more complete understanding of the biological mechanism of autism is formed. For example, we may propose that \"gene X fails to effectively translate social information into knowledge-layer representations in the autistic brain by influencing the strength of the connection between Y and Z in the brain; Gene therapy enhances Y-Z connections, repairs information flow, and improves social behavior\", a new mechanistic insight that is both a triumph for the DIKWP model and a significant contribution to the understanding of autism pathology.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Result:</strong> This module will achieve the following outcomes:</p>\n<p><strong>Scientific discovery level</strong>: identify 1-2 molecular pathways that have a decisive impact on social cognitive impairment in autism, and verify their causal effects through gene editing. For example, we are expected to show that \"<strong>restoring the function of the gene SHANK3 can reverse some social deficits in autism</strong>\" or \"<strong>inhibiting the overactive mTOR pathway can improve repetitive behaviors in autism models</strong>\", these findings will be published in high-level journals and attract academic attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Technological breakthrough</strong>: forming a gene editing intervention paradigm for autism. While gene therapy is currently focused on monogenic genetic diseases, our work will be expanded to the complex disease autism to be the first to provide proof-of-concept data. Relevant technical achievements (such as AAV-CRISPR vector construction methods for specific genes, mouse behavior improvement data) can be patented, laying the foundation for future industrialization.</p>\n<p><strong>Theoretical model level</strong>: Through the combination of experiment and model, the coverage of the DIKWP artificial consciousness model on the biological level is greatly enriched. We will update the parameters of the model to quantitatively simulate the influence of genes on cognitive processes, and form a \"gene-brain-cognition\" trinity model of autism mechanism. The model itself is an innovation that can be used as a digital twin to test the effects of various intervention strategies in a virtual environment and accelerate the development process.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the results of this module will mark a key step in our exploration of autism treatment, expanding from relying solely on behavioral/educational interventions to biomedical correction, providing hope for a fundamental cure for autism. At the same time, the new theories and technologies generated by the project will also have a demonstration effect on the research and treatment of other neurodevelopmental disorders (intellectual disability, attention deficit, etc.).</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-4-Clinical-Research-and-System-Convergence-Purpose-Layer-Platform-Integration-Application-Demonstration\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-4-Clinical-Research-and-System-Convergence-Purpose-Layer-Platform-Integration-Application-Demonstration\" title=\"3.4 Clinical Research and System Convergence (Purpose Layer &amp; Platform Integration &amp; Application Demonstration)\"></a><strong>3.4 Clinical Research and System Convergence (Purpose Layer &amp; Platform Integration &amp; Application Demonstration)</strong></h2><p><strong>Overview:</strong> This module aims to integrate and apply the results of the above studies to the actual clinical setting, construct an artificial awareness-driven autism assessment and intervention system, and verify its effectiveness and generalizability through clinical trials. Specifically, the AI diagnostic system developed in 3.2 will be connected to the existing diagnosis and treatment process in the hospital, and clinicians will be trained to use and evaluate its diagnostic performance improvement, the potential therapeutic targets and intervention methods screened in 3.3 will be integrated into the comprehensive clinical autism intervention plan to explore a new model of personalized treatment, and the artificial awareness research platform for autism will be established to integrate data, models and applications, so as to realize the long-term sharing and update iteration of project results. Eventually, this module will output a set of practical clinical solutions and platforms, paving the way for the promotion and transformation of results.</p>\n<p><strong>Main Research and Work Tasks:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(1) Clinical deployment and verification of the intelligent diagnosis system: The</strong> child psychology department/rehabilitation department of the cooperative hospital was selected as a pilot, and the multimodal AI diagnosis system completed by module 3.2 was deployed to the real clinic environment. First, medical staff were trained to master the use of the system, including data collection (such as entering children's behavior videos, importing EEG results, etc.), AI analysis triggering, report interpretation, etc. Then, when receiving new patients in the outpatient clinic, an AI system is introduced to participate in the evaluation: the system analyzes the patient's data and gives predictions and reports on the possibility of autism, and then the clinician makes a comprehensive judgment together with the routine diagnosis. We will collect data from all children who come to the clinic over a period of time, and compare the joint diagnosis conclusions of AI+ doctors with the conclusions of traditional doctors only and the results of follow-up visits, and calculate the auxiliary value of AI. For example, whether AI improves the detection rate of mild autism and reduces missed and misdiagnosed cases. In controversial cases, an independent expert assessment is organized to determine the reasonableness of the AI recommendations. In addition to diagnostic accuracy, physicians' satisfaction and compliance with the system (through questionnaires) are also evaluated, the user-friendliness of the system is understood, and the interpretation report helps clinical decision-making. If it is found that some modules of the system are not suitable for clinical practice (such as data acquisition takes too long or the report is too professional and difficult to understand), feedback to the R&amp;D team for optimization and improvement in time. After the success of the pilot, develop a standardized clinical application process and user manual to prepare for a large-scale rollout.</p>\n<p><strong>(2) Application of artificial consciousness assessment in rehabilitation training:</strong> An important aspect of autism treatment is rehabilitation training, such as social skills training, sensory integration training, etc. We plan to embed the artificial consciousness assessment module into the rehabilitation scene to monitor and evaluate the changes in children's cognitive status in real time, so as to achieve personalized intervention. Specifically, a cognitive assessment assistance system is developed: cameras and wearable devices are used to record the child's performance in the training session (such as facial expressions, heart rate, attention span), and the AI model analyzes the data in real time to determine the child's current mood and concentration level, as well as the level of understanding of the training instructions. This information is fed back to the therapist instantly, for example, when the system prompts \"the child may feel frustrated and has decreased concentration at the moment\", and the therapist can adjust the strategy accordingly (adding encouragement or taking a break for a while). In addition, based on data over time, the system can plot training progress curves, such as the trend of social eye contact frequency with training, which provides a quantitative basis for evaluating efficacy. In order to verify this function, we will select a certain number of trained children in cooperative rehabilitation institutions, half of them will be randomly assigned to use AI-assisted, and the other half will be trained as usual, and the difference in training effect will be compared. For example, the use of AI-assisted groups is expected to have a greater increase in social skills scale scores and a possible shortened training period. Such results will demonstrate that artificial awareness techniques can not only assess the problem, but also improve the intervention itself, thus highlighting the comprehensive value of the project system.</p>\n<p><strong>(3) Individualized intervention plan and multidisciplinary consultation: The</strong> best intervention for autism often needs to be individualized and multidisciplinary. This module will use our platform to suggest individualized interventions. After diagnosis, the system generates a comprehensive report based on each child's unique cognitive and neurological characteristics (e.g., weak language comprehension, good motor coordination, presence of OXTR gene variants, etc.), listing priority areas of intervention and options, such as: \"Social communication training (improves eye contact); Oxytocin nasal spray was used to assist social motivation (due to low OXTR expression); sensory integration training (alleviating hyperacusis), etc.\" A multidisciplinary consultation (psychiatrist, rehabilitation therapist, genetic counselor, etc.) is then organized to develop a specific treatment plan based on the recommendations and discuss with the parents. In follow-up follow-up, the patient's progress data will continue to be entered into the system to update their understanding of the patient's status, and if an intervention is not effective, the system can also prompt adjustment of the plan. Through this closed loop, we explore the role of AI-assisted decision-making in personalized medicine for autism. The evaluation indicators can be parent questionnaire satisfaction, changes in children's core symptoms after intervention (such as improvement in social quotient assessment), etc. We expect that individualized approaches will achieve better outcomes and parental acceptance than traditional \"one-size-fits-all\" approaches. This will open up a new horizon for AI in decision support for autism treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>(4) Construction of autism artificial consciousness research platform:</strong> For long-term consideration, we will integrate the big data collected and the developed model algorithms throughout the project to build an open research platform. The platform includes: data layer (a database that stores brain imaging, genetic, behavioral multimodal data and follow-up information, and pays attention to patient privacy protection), model layer (an algorithm library that implements DIKWP models, which can be used to simulate different scenarios), and an interface layer (which provides a friendly web interface and API interface for researchers and clinicians to query and use). The platform initially serves the project team to manage the analysis process in a unified manner and accelerate the output of results. In the later stage of the project, we plan to gradually open up to a wider range of teams: invite domestic teams interested in autism research to join, share data resources and some models (with ethical permission), and regularly update the platform functions (such as adding analysis tools and visualization modules). At the same time, we will cooperate with relevant government departments or industry associations to strive to incorporate our platform into the industry infrastructure as part of the national autism big data center or intelligent diagnosis and treatment demonstration platform. This will greatly enhance the impact and vitality of the results of the project, so that it can continue to play a role after the end of the project, and promote new research and applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Results:</strong> Driven by this module, we hope to achieve the \"last mile\" leap from laboratory results to clinical practice. Expected specific accomplishments include:</p>\n<p><strong>A set of empirical clinical diagnosis and treatment processes</strong>: autism assessment standard process integrating AI diagnosis, artificial consciousness-assisted rehabilitation training standards, multidisciplinary consultation and decision support guidelines, etc. These will be summarized as clinical guidance manuals, which may be submitted to the National Health Commission for trial on a larger scale, laying the groundwork for the development of industry standards.</p>\n<p><strong>Autism Artificial Intelligence Diagnosis and Treatment Platform (Software System):</strong> Software that integrates diagnosis, evaluation, intervention and recommendation functions, operates stably in pilot hospitals and institutions, and has scalability. By the end of the project, we plan to make it ready for rollout by reaching Technology Maturity Level 7 (demonstrated and validated in the relevant environment). Key modules of the platform, such as cognitive evaluation engine, AI diagnosis plug-in, data management system, etc., can be considered for registration as software copyrights or patents.</p>\n<p><strong>Clinical Data and Translational Evidence</strong>: The results of rigorously designed clinical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our systems in improving diagnostic accuracy, reducing mean age at diagnosis, improving training efficacy, and high physician and patient satisfaction. This evidence will be published in the form of a paper and will be used to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our technology to regulatory authorities, and to expedite approval and adoption.</p>\n<p><strong>Talent team and discipline development</strong>: During the implementation of the project, we have cultivated a group of compound talents who understand both artificial intelligence and brain science and clinical practice, including postdoctoral fellows and young doctors. This team will become the backbone of the research and service in the interdisciplinary field of \"AI + autism\" in the future, and also lay the foundation for related emerging disciplines (such as digital psychiatry and artificial intelligence medicine).</p>\n<p>Overall, this module will ensure that the innovations of this project are truly rooted and translated into productivity for the benefit of patients and society. We not only provide <strong>\"visible</strong>\" new technologies, but also provide <strong>\"well-used</strong>\" new paradigms, so that artificial intelligence and artificial consciousness theory can more closely serve clinical needs and realize the transformation of science and technology into real productivity.</p>\n<h1 id=\"4-Feasibility-analysis\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-Feasibility-analysis\" title=\"4. Feasibility analysis\"></a><strong>4. Feasibility analysis</strong></h1><p>The project is carried out by an interdisciplinary team led by Professor Duan Yucong, who has outstanding strengths in artificial intelligence, cognitive modeling, brain science and clinical medicine, which provides a solid foundation for the smooth implementation of the project. The following analyzes the feasibility of the project from the aspects of team foundation, technical conditions, and cooperation environment:</p>\n<p><strong>Comprehensive strength of the team:</strong> First of all, the project leader, Professor Duan Yucong, is the proposer of the DIKWP artificial consciousness theory, and has a world-leading academic position in the field of cognitive computing and artificial intelligence basic theory. As the first inventor, he has been granted 114 invention patents, covering many cutting-edge directions such as large model training, artificial consciousness construction, and cognitive operating systems. This means that the team has a large number of independent intellectual property rights and key technologies in the design of artificial intelligence algorithms and cognitive systems, and will not be controlled by others. In terms of brain science, the core members of the team include young researchers with a background in computational neuroscience and cognitive neuroimaging, who have presided over projects such as brain network analysis and brain-computer interface, and are familiar with the research methods of brain diseases. At the same time, there are also front-line clinical child psychiatrists and rehabilitation treatment experts, who have been engaged in the diagnosis and treatment of autism for a long time and have rich case resources and experience. Such a closely integrated lineup of \"industry, academia, research and medicine\" ensures the seamless connection of professional knowledge in all aspects of the project. For example, AI experts and clinicians can work together to develop feature sets when designing AI diagnostic models, and neuroscientists and AI experts can collaborate to incorporate biological patterns into the model when interpreting brain imaging results. The team also has rich experience in cooperation in the past, and has established a good communication and project management mechanism, with clear responsibilities and efficient cooperation for each sub-project. Therefore, from the perspective of staffing and organizational management, we are ideally positioned to take on this complex and cross-cutting topic.</p>\n<p><strong>Preliminary Research Basis:</strong> The team has carried out important preliminary work in related fields, providing preliminary results and technical reserves to verify the feasibility of the project:</p>\n<p>In terms of AI cognitive models, we have developed a prototype system of DIKWP models, which deconstructs the reasoning process of large language models into five links: data, information, knowledge, intelligence, and intent, and monitors them. This proves that the DIKWP model can be embedded in the actual AI system and output interpretable results. This technology can be directly migrated to the design of the AI diagnostic module used in this project.</p>\n<p>In terms of autism recognition algorithms, the team members recently published a paper in an international journal on the fusion of multi-perspective behavioral features to identify autism, and the proposed model has achieved leading accuracy on public datasets (such as using graph neural networks to fuse facial expressions and eye movements to achieve an accuracy rate of more than 85%). This shows that the team has a deep grasp of the difficulties and key points of AI diagnosis of autism, and has the ability to develop more complex models.</p>\n<p>In terms of brain imaging and genetic research, we have preliminary fMRI data of children with autism, and conducted some network analysis, and found that the phenomena of autism such as reduced default network connection and sensory network overconnection are consistent with the literature. At the same time, we participated in the whole exome sequencing study of autism in China and found several risk gene variants unique to the Chinese population. These preliminary data support the hypothesis of the project study (e.g., autism does have abnormal brain connectivity and genetic basis) on the one hand, and on the other hand, provide data and experience for follow-up research, reducing uncertainty.</p>\n<p>In addition, we have established cooperative relationships with well-known autism research institutions in China (such as the Autism Research Center of Peking University Sixth Hospital) and rehabilitation institutions, so that more samples can be obtained and joint research can be carried out. These collaboration channels ensure the source of cases and data required for the implementation of the project, and facilitate the replication of results.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical conditions and platform: The</strong> experimental conditions required for this project have been basically met in the unit where the team is located and the cooperative unit.</p>\n<p><strong>Laboratory equipment:</strong> Hainan University and cooperative hospitals have 3T magnetic resonance imaging instrument, 64-lead and above high-density EEG system, biological signal recorder, gene sequencing platform, high-performance computing server and other key equipment, which can meet the needs of brain imaging collection, genetic analysis and AI model training. Among them, the GPU cluster configured by the School of Computer Science (with a total computing power of hundreds of TeraFLOPS per second) will be dedicated to the training and simulation of large-scale deep learning models for this project.</p>\n<p><strong>Data resources:</strong> In addition to self-collection, we can also use authorized multi-center autism databases, including ABIDE brain imaging database, SFARI gene bank and other international resources, as well as behavioral video data accumulated by multiple rehabilitation institutions in China. These valuable data assets provide a broad foundation for model training and validation. We will also continue to gather more data in the construction of the platform to form a virtuous circle.</p>\n<p><strong>Core algorithms and tools:</strong> The team has mastered a number of self-developed software tools, such as cognitive graph construction software, brain network analysis package, federated learning framework, etc., which can be directly used in the development of this project. In addition, the team is proficient in using common AI and brain science tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and SPM/fNIRS to speed up development. What's even more rare is that we have a code implementation and use license for DIKWP-related patents, which means that we can use these cutting-edge algorithm components in our projects without any barriers, and it is difficult for other teams to replicate this capability in a short period of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Clinical trial conditions:</strong> The partner hospital has passed the ethics approval, allowing us to introduce AI-assisted diagnosis and collect relevant data in the clinical environment. The hospital also said that it will open up its information system interface to facilitate our access to data, which solves the practical obstacles to the implementation of the AI system. In addition, in terms of gene editing animal experiments, the animal center of Hainan University is equipped with SPF-level animal rooms, microinjection, behavioral tests and other conditions, and our team members also have rich experience in mouse operation to ensure that the experiments are carried out safely and compliantly.</p>\n<p><strong>Project Risks and Countermeasures:</strong> Although the project is ambitious, we have fully considered the potential technical and implementation risks, and formulated a plan:</p>\n<p>Data quality and sample size risk: Autism is heterogeneous and has high individual differences, which may make it difficult to train and generalize models. In this regard, we augmented the samples through multi-center and multi-modal data collection, and used data augmentation and domain adaptation techniques to improve the robustness of the model. At the same time, statistical experts are invited to control the experimental design to ensure that there is sufficient statistical power to detect the expected effect.</p>\n<p>Interdisciplinary communication risks: AI engineers and clinicians have different understandings of problems, which can lead to communication barriers. In this regard, we regularly organize cross-cutting seminars and personnel exchange visits to allow members from different backgrounds to train each other on basic knowledge, establish unified terminology, and set up cross-topic leaders in project management to coordinate communication and ensure that the requirements are aligned.</p>\n<p>Gene editing ethics and safety risks: Gene interventions are clinically strictly limited, we only explore at the cell and animal stages, all experiments adhere to ethical norms, and biosafety assessments are conducted in advance. We also pay attention to the international discussion of gene therapy for autism, and actively communicate with ethics experts to ensure that the study is within the acceptable range and is ready for possible clinical trials in the future.</p>\n<p>Risks of technical implementation difficulties: for example, metacognitive artificial awareness modules may be difficult to debug, and the clinical adaptability of AI systems. In this regard, we have established milestones (see the next section) to ensure early verification of key technologies, and adjust the plan in time if the technical route is found to be unsuccessful. For example, if the metacognitive module is not effective, we can simplify it to the purpose verification of heuristic rules, which reduces the difficulty but still achieves some functions.</p>\n<p>Based on the above analysis, it can be seen that the project is fully prepared in terms of personnel, finance, and materials, and there are countermeasures for key risks. We are confident that we will achieve the research objectives within the established timeline and flexibly adjust as needed in the process to ensure the success of the project and the high-quality results.</p>\n<h1 id=\"5-Milestones-and-milestones\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#5-Milestones-and-milestones\" title=\"5.

Among them, milestones 1-3 are to lay the foundation for the follow-up of the project, milestones 4-5 mark that the project has entered the stage of tackling key problems and produce important scientific research results, and milestones 6-8 focus on transformation and application and closing summary. The setting of these milestones not only ensures the timely breakthrough of key technologies (such as AI systems and gene validation), but also ensures the implementation of application verification (such as clinical trials and platform operation), so as to achieve the goal of paying equal attention to scientific exploration and practical value creation.</p>\n<p>Through the checks on the phased results, we are confident that the set goals of the project will be fully achieved. The results of each stage will also be used as a quantitative assessment point for the progress of the project, so that the fund management department can keep abreast of the project progress and give guidance to ensure the high-quality completion of the project.</p>\n<h1 id=\"6-Achievement-form-and-assessment-indicators\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#6-Achievement-form-and-assessment-indicators\" title=\"6. Achievement form and assessment indicators\"></a><strong>6. Achievement form and assessment indicators</strong></h1><p>The expected outputs of this project will take a variety of forms, covering multiple levels such as theoretical methods, technical platforms and application demonstrations. In order to scientifically evaluate the effectiveness of the project, we have added a number of innovative indicators on the basis of the traditional assessment indicators and the characteristics of the project.

Assessment indicators: 1 invention patent ≥, such as \"XXXX gene splicing therapy method for improving social behavior of autism\", and entered the substantive examination. Although it is difficult to be clinically implemented in the short term, it is novel and feasible as a reserve technology.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Platform and Application Results:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Autism Artificial Awareness Research and Diagnosis and Treatment Platform: An</strong> integrated platform that includes a database, analysis system, and user interface. Assessment indicators: the platform has complete functional modules, and there are no major failures after pilot operation; The number of cases included in the platform ≥ N cases (e.g., 200 cases ≥), including multimodal data and follow-up information; The number of platform users (number of investigator or doctor accounts) ≥M. An important part of the platform, such as the cognitive assessment engine, is recognized through third-party assessments.</p>\n<p><strong>Demonstration application and clinical report:</strong> Realize the demonstration application of AI-assisted diagnosis in partner hospitals.

Assessment indicators: Lead/participate in the formulation of 1 group standard or guideline ≥, such as \"Technical Guidelines for Intelligent Diagnosis and Assessment of Autism in China\", and submit it to the society/association for discussion. If it can be approved for release within the project period, it will be considered overfulfilled.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Talent Development and Team Building:</strong></p>\n<p>Cultivating a number of cross-border talents. Assessment indicators: <strong>≥ x dissertations of doctoral/master's degree dissertations</strong> are completed on the basis of the results of this project; 5 project team members made presentations at international conferences≥ Some team members have been selected into the high-level talent plan or won relevant scientific and technological awards. Team cohesion and continuous research ability have been enhanced, and a stable interdisciplinary research direction has been formed.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Public Perception and Social Impact:</strong></p>\n<p>This project will raise public awareness of autism and artificial intelligence through popular science and media outreach. Assessment indicators: 5 ≥ popular science lectures**/trainings**; Mainstream media reported on the progress of the project ≥ 3 times; At the end of the project, the public (especially families with autism) had significantly increased their acceptance of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment (before and after through a questionnaire).</p>\n<p>Among the above indicators, there are quantitative indicators (number of papers, accuracy improvement, etc.) to ensure objective measurement, and qualitative indicators (expert satisfaction, standard setting, etc.) to reflect the long-term value of the project. <strong>Particular emphasis was placed on two new indicators:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Artificial consciousness subsystem construction indicators:</strong> Requires the successful development of the DIKWP artificial consciousness module for the diagnosis of autism, which will verify the existence in the form of patented software or technical reports. Its performance is quantified by explanatory and controllability indicators, such as the length of the decision-making traceability chain, the success rate of self-regulation of anomaly detection, etc., which will be refined during the development process.</p>\n<p><strong>Quantitative indicators of DIKWP cognitive engine for diagnosis improvement: Compared</strong> with the models with or without DIKWP framework, the differences in diagnostic accuracy, false positive and false negative rate, and model correction ability were measured. For example, we will report that \"after the introduction of DIKWP, the model increased the recall rate for mild cases by X% and reduced the misjudgments for confounding diseases such as ADHD by Y%\". Another quantification is the correctness of interpretation: the proportion of key conclusions in AI reports that are consistent with those of physicians, which is expected to be significantly higher than that of models without DIKWP.</p>\n<p>Through these indicator systems, we can comprehensively evaluate the scientific and technological output and application value of the project. We will regularly check our progress against indicators, identify deviations and adjust our priorities to ensure that the final deliverables are of high quality and stand up to scrutiny. For example, if the output of the paper does not meet expectations at a certain stage, we will strengthen the data analysis and writing organization; If the diagnostic accuracy is not significantly improved, the model design can be troubled or the amount of data will be increased. The assessment indicators are both a constraint and a motivation, prompting the team to maintain high standards, ultimately achieve the expected goals of the project, and even achieve gains that exceed expectations.</p>\n<h1 id=\"7-Campaigns-and-conversion-paths\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#7-Campaigns-and-conversion-paths\" title=\"7. Campaigns and conversion paths\"></a><strong>7. Campaigns and conversion paths</strong></h1><p>The results of this project have broad application prospects and industrial transformation value. We have formulated a clear promotion plan and path to ensure that after the completion of the project, these new technologies and paradigms can quickly move from scientific research to clinical and market, and produce tangible social and economic benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Establish a research platform for artificial awareness of autism and promote continuous innovation:</strong> One of the results of the project is the research platform for artificial awareness of autism (see module 3.4 for details), which is the basis for future promotion. At the end of the project, we will set up a \"<strong>Research Center for Artificial Intelligence and Consciousness for Autism\" at Hainan University or a partner institution</strong>, and continue to operate on this platform. The center will integrate research, clinical, and industry, and continuously update data and algorithms, so that the platform will become a resource shared by autism researchers and doctors across the country. We plan to apply for the platform to be included in the management of the national or provincial science and technology infrastructure platform to obtain policy and financial support. In the long term, the platform can also be expanded to include modules on other developmental disabilities (e.g., ADHD, language delays) to become a comprehensive AI research infrastructure for child developmental disabilities. Through the openness and scalability of the platform, it attracts more teams to join, continuously incubates new research topics and technology applications, and forms a virtuous circle of new qualitative productivity platform.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Model as a service deployment to accelerate clinical popularization:</strong> After successful clinical validation, we will package the AI diagnostic model and cognitive assessment system and deploy it to the cloud to provide software-as-a-service (<strong>). SaaS). Hospitals or rehabilitation facilities do not need local complex equipment, and can simply upload patient data through a secure interface to obtain AI analysis results. This greatly lowers the threshold for the use of technology, which is conducive to the promotion of medical and rehabilitation units at all levels across the country. We will work with healthcare IT companies to integrate the service into their existing electronic medical records or diagnosis and treatment systems and into the physician workflow</strong>. For example, we worked with a major children's hospital information system provider to embed our AI assessment into the electronic record interface of the autism clinic so that doctors can call up the analysis with one click. For grassroots or remote areas, we also plan to develop mobile apps or portable terminals so that grassroots doctors or parents can also access initial screening and guidance. Through the deployment of cloud services and apps, we expect to achieve autism diagnosis and treatment centers in major provinces across the country within 3 years after the end of the project, so that more than 1,000 doctors can use our system, and <strong>more than 10,000 children will benefit from it.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3. Industry standardization and certification promotion:</strong> We are well aware that medical AI products must obtain industry standards and regulatory certifications for widespread application. To this end, we will actively participate in the development of relevant standards (such as the draft guidelines/standards mentioned in the aforementioned indicators). When the project is completed, we strive to make \"AI-assisted autism diagnosis\" <strong>written into national or industry standards. In terms of supervision, we will apply to the State Food and Drug Administration for approval of AI medical devices on the basis of clinical trial data, and strive to become the first approved AI diagnostic software for autism in China. At the same time, we will promote the inclusion of our assessment indicators in the diagnosis and treatment of autism, such as suggesting that AI objective assessment be used as an auxiliary diagnosis basis. These efforts will lay the foundation for market access and regulated use. Once we have obtained certification and standard endorsement, our technology will be more easily procured and adopted by medical institutions around the world, accelerating the speed of adoption.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4. Commercialization and industrial implementation:</strong> Although this project is led by scientific research, we attach great importance to the industrialization potential of the results. The patent pool of Professor Duan Yucong's team has built an intellectual property moat in the field of AI cognition and artificial awareness. Relying on this, we will explore the establishment of technology start-ups or joint existing enterprises for industrial transformation. Specific paths include: negotiating cooperation or technology licensing with large medical device/medical AI companies, and expanding AI diagnostic systems as their product lines; Cooperate with genetic testing companies to develop a package of solutions for autism, including genetic testing + AI assessment + consulting services; Seeking venture capital investment, the company established a start-up company to focus on the development of children's intelligent diagnosis and treatment platform. If the conditions are ripe, the core members of our team can start a business part-time to ensure that the core technology does not leak out. With the abundant patents that Professor Duan has obtained, we have a strong advantage in the negotiation to attract corporate investment and move forward together. Once industrialized, the company's profit model can be software licensing, subscription services, supporting hardware sales, etc. It is conservatively estimated that there are millions of children with autism and related disorders in China, and no less than 100,000 new diagnostic needs are added every year, and the market demand for intelligent diagnosis and treatment systems is huge. On a per-case basis, the potential market size is billions of dollars per year. At the same time, the results of genetic interventions also have patent value, which can be licensed to pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies to promote drug or gene therapy research and development. Overall, the commercial prospects of the project results are broad, and we will carefully plan the patent and commercial layout to truly transform the scientific research results into productivity and emerging industries.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Social impact and policy support:</strong> To drive transformation, we will also start with the social and policy aspects to create a positive environment. On the one hand, we will convey the value of our technology to decision-makers through industry conferences and media reports, and strive to incorporate \"artificial intelligence + autism\" into relevant policies (such as digital health projects, rehabilitation support programs for disabled children, etc.). On the other hand, we should actively carry out science popularization to improve the public's acceptance of AI diagnosis and treatment and reduce possible misunderstandings and resistance. We will also maintain high standards in ethics and safety to earn trust with practical results. Through close contact with the government and associations, we hope to promote demonstration projects, such as the pilot of \"AI early screening for autism\" in a province, where the government will purchase services to provide screening for high-risk children. This can not only quickly expand the impact, but also reflect the public good value of technology.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Expand to related fields: The</strong> artificial consciousness cognitive framework and intelligent diagnosis and treatment platform built by the project results are not limited to autism as a disorder. After success, we plan to replicate the experience to other neuropsychiatric diseases, such as ADHD in children, depression, Alzheimer's disease, etc., all of which have the problem of relying on subjective diagnosis and lacking objective indicators, and can also introduce the DIKWP model for improvement. We are already exploring collaboration with the Alzheimer's Diagnosis and Treatment Center to use artificial awareness assessment for mild cognitive impairment screening, for example. If this expansion goes well, our technology platform and company product line will be richer, so as to obtain greater social and economic benefits.

Background and significance of the project\"></a><strong>1. Background and significance of the project</strong></h1><p>**(1) Population aging and Alzheimer's disease challenges. **With the acceleration of the global population ageing, dementia diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) have become a serious public health problem. There are currently more than 55 million people with dementia worldwide, with about 10 million new cases each year (WHO, 2023), of which Alzheimer's disease is the main type. AD is characterized by progressive deterioration of memory and cognitive function, which not only seriously affects the quality of life of patients, but also places a heavy burden on families and the healthcare system. More worryingly, late diagnosis or misdiagnosis often occurs in clinical practice. Therefore, how to achieve early assessment (identify mild cognitive impairment or early AD before the onset of obvious dementia symptoms), <strong>continuously monitor the process of cognitive decline, and implement effective interventions to delay the course of the disease have become urgent problems in the academic and clinical fields.</strong></p>\n<p>**and (2) the limitations of traditional cognitive screening and intervention models. **At present, clinical assessment of cognitive decline mainly relies on scales such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), but these tools can usually only provide cross-sectional and coarse-grained cognitive function assessments, and have limited sensitivity to slight changes in the early stage of AD. For example, MoCA has a sensitivity of only about 74% for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at commonly used cut-off scores. At the same time, the results of cognitive screening are easily affected by education level and subjective state, and there is a certain bias. In addition, the traditional model tends to follow a passive chain of \"symptom onset – medical visit – symptomatic treatment\". Patients are usually detected and intervened after a significant decline in function, at which point the optimal window for intervention may have been lost. In terms of intervention, standardized cognitive training or drug therapy was mostly used in the past, and there was a lack of real-time adaptation and adjustment for individuals. For example, fixed-difficulty memory exercises or general-purpose drug regimens cannot dynamically adapt to the patient's daily fluctuations in state and specific deficit structures. This passive, static model is difficult to meet the active, continuous, and individualized management needs of chronic progressive diseases such as AD.</p>\n<p><strong>and (3) the introduction of new opportunities for artificial intelligence and</strong> **brain-computer interfaces. **In recent years, the emergence of artificial intelligence technology has brought new hope for the early detection and intervention of cognitive impairment. For example, <strong>brain-computer interface technologies such as electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared brain imaging (fNIRS) can provide objective indicators of neural activity in the brain and have been shown to be helpful in the early detection of biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. Studies have shown that EEG brain wave analysis can be used to distinguish healthy elderly from MCI/AD patients, as a valuable early diagnosis tool, and can be integrated into a multimodal diagnostic system. As a means of monitoring blood oxygen changes in the cerebral cortex, fNIRS has the advantages of being safe, portable, and relatively inexpensive. It has been experimentally demonstrated that combining cognitive training with cognitive training to provide real-time feedback on brain activity (i.e., neurofeedback</strong>) is expected to improve cognitive functions such as working memory in elderly MCI populations. In addition, <strong>advanced AI algorithms such as large models (LLMs) have shown potential in medical text analysis and cognitive state prediction. For example, studies have used large language models to analyze electronic medical record clinical notes to detect early signs of cognitive decline. The results show that LLM has good performance in identifying narrative cues in patients with early MCI, which complements traditional machine learning. On the other hand, virtual reality (VR) cognitive training can improve the participation and training effect of elderly patients through immersive interactive tasks. Experiments have proved that VR cognitive training can significantly improve the overall cognitive function of the elderly with mild cognitive impairment</strong>, especially in memory, attention, and executive function. These advances suggest that the combination of multimodal biological signal acquisition, intelligent model analysis, and immersive training is expected to build a closed-loop \"monitoring-intervention-remonitoring\" system to achieve active management of cognitive decline.</p>\n<p>**(4) There is an urgent need for a unified model of cognitive degradation mechanism. **However, at present, most of the above-mentioned new technologies are applied independently of each other, and there is a lack of a unified framework to effectively integrate them, so there are obvious structural defects and processing bottlenecks. For example: (1) Brain-computer interfaces provide rich data, but how to transform massive and heterogeneous sensor data into meaningful \"information\" and \"knowledge\", and interpret them in combination with patients' specific cognitive tasks? Existing systems often stay at signal classification or simple indicator calculations, and lack an overall understanding of the cognitive state of the brain. (2) The large model has strong pattern recognition and knowledge expression capabilities, but its reasoning process is a \"black box\", <strong>without explicit purpose driven</strong>, and it also lacks the ability to directly process real-time physiological data. Large models can be hallucinogenic or biased, and there is no guarantee that the output will always meet medical safety requirements. (3) Cognitive screening and VR training are fighting separately: screening provides diagnosis but not continuity, and training provides intervention but insufficient feedback. The lack of closed-loop linkage between the two makes it difficult for training to dynamically optimize for the problems found in screening, and screening cannot evaluate the real-time effect of training. <strong>Information silos lead to opaque decision-making and are difficult to correct in time. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a new theoretical framework that can understand and simulate the whole process of \"cognitive decline-intervention perception\" from the system level</strong>, and integrate data collection, information processing, knowledge reasoning, intelligent decision-making, and purpose driving to create an adaptive intelligent closed-loop system.</p>\n<p>**(5) The introduction and advantages of the DIKWP artificial consciousness model. **In response to the above challenges, the team of Professor Duan Yucong of Hainan University proposed the DIKWP artificial consciousness model, which provides a new framework for understanding and coping with cognitive deterioration in the elderly. DIKWP is a new cognitive model based on the classical DIKW (pyramid) model with a \"Purpose/Intention\" layer. The core idea is to divide the cognitive process of the agent into <strong>five levels: Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom-Purpose, and closely couple each layer through a network structure to achieve two-way feedback and iterative update</strong>。 In other words, DIKWP believes that intelligent systems must not only be able to extract information, form knowledge, and make intelligent decisions from data, but must also be driven and calibrated by higher-level intent. This is similar to how the human brain works: the brain processes information through neural networks, but human behavior and decisions are often driven by goals, motivations, and values. <strong>From the perspective of artificial consciousness, DIKWP provides a unified cognitive language and structure</strong> that can map every step of the machine's reasoning to a human-understandable semantic process. This brings three major advantages to the modeling of complex DM-intervention systems:</p>\n<p><strong>Global goal orientation:</strong> The introduction of the purpose layer ensures that the system is always operating around established cognitive health goals. For example, taking \"delaying the decline of patients' memory\" as the top-level purpose can guide the data collection and intervention decision-making at the lower level to serve this goal, so as to avoid the output of the AI model and ensure value alignment and security.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-layer semantic integration:</strong> The DIKWP model establishes a clear semantic interface at each layer, so that the low-level data can be mapped to the high-level knowledge and intent. Rather than being separated, the layers form a dynamic loop through bidirectional semantic communication. This means that the physiological data captured by the sensor (such as brain waves) not only supports the judgment of cognitive state (information → knowledge) upward, but also the understanding and goal of the situation at the upper level will also affect the interpretation and attention of the data (intention→ intelligence→...). → data) to overcome the rigidity of traditional one-way processes. <strong>The flow of data-information-knowledge-intelligence-purpose constitutes a closed-loop system, which makes the system have human-like self-adjustment capabilities.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Consciousness Characteristics:</strong> DIKWP is essentially a simulation of the mechanisms of human consciousness. Through the combination of information processing and intention-driven, it simulates functions and characteristics similar to human consciousness in artificial systems. For example, the system not only passively responds to input data, but also has \"subjective intent\" like a human, actively choosing which information to focus on, what knowledge to use to reason, and reflecting and adjusting its own decisions. This gives the system autonomy and adaptability, which is particularly suitable for coping with highly individualized and dynamic changes in the cognitive state of the elderly.</p>\n<p>In summary, the artificial consciousness system based on the DIKWP model is expected to break the limitations of traditional methods and build an intelligent closed-loop framework based on data, supported by knowledge, and centered on intent. It can transform the multimodal data collected by the brain-computer interface into a deep understanding of the patient's cognitive state, and continuously optimize the intervention strategy driven by artificial consciousness, achieving a major leap in the modeling of the \"cognitive decline-intervention perception\" system. This has important theoretical significance and application value for improving the early assessment and intervention effect of Alzheimer's disease and reducing the social burden.</p>\n<h1 id=\"2-A-review-of-the-current-status-of-research-at-home-and-abroad\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-A-review-of-the-current-status-of-research-at-home-and-abroad\" title=\"2. A review of the current status of research at home and abroad\"></a><strong>2. A review of the current status of research at home and abroad</strong></h1><p>Focusing on the theme of this project, this section reviews the current research status at home and abroad from four aspects: brain-computer interface, large model, cognitive screening and <strong>virtual reality cognitive training</strong>, analyzes the structural defects and bottlenecks of existing methods, and clarifies the new breakthroughs provided by the DIKWP artificial consciousness model.</p>\n<p><strong>2.1 Brain-computer interface and multimodal cognitive assessment:</strong> Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has attracted extensive attention in the detection of cognitive impairment in recent years. Among them, <strong>the non-invasive means represented by electroencephalography (EEG) are regarded as promising tools for early detection of Alzheimer's disease due to their low cost and high temporal resolution. Foreign studies have shown that the power and network connection indicators of some frequency bands of EEG are significantly different from those of healthy elderly patients with MCI and early AD, which can be used as biomarkers to assist diagnosis. For example, Ahmed et al. found that the accuracy of EEG algorithms combining time-frequency analysis and machine learning for AD diagnosis was significantly higher than that of random. Some scholars in China have used the complex network characteristics of EEG to predict the transformation trend of MCI to AD, and have achieved preliminary results. At the same time, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is emerging, which reflects neural activity by monitoring local blood oxygen changes in the cortex. Compared with EEG, fNIRS is more anti-interference and portable and easy to use, especially suitable for cognitive research in the elderly population. Some cutting-edge work has tried to use fNIRS for working memory training feedback in MCI patients: a study conducted by Lee et al. allowed elderly people with MCI to receive cognitive training in a VR environment, and at the same time used fNIRS to measure their prefrontal lobe activation and real-time feedback, and the results showed that the training group had a significant improvement in the executive function test compared with the control group. This suggests that incorporating neurofeedback into cognitive training can help enhance efficacy. Overall, brain-computer interfaces provide a new way to objectively quantify cognitive state. However, there are still processing bottlenecks in their application</strong>: <strong>first</strong>, EEG and fNIRS data are high-dimensional and noisy, which vary significantly between different individuals and environments, and traditional data-driven methods are susceptible to overfitting and noise. <strong>Second</strong>, a single modality is often not enough to fully reflect the cognitive process, and multimodal data fusion is required, but this brings complexity to the algorithm and computation, and the optimal strategy for EEG-fNIRS-behavioral multimodal fusion is still inconclusive. <strong>Third</strong>, the existing systems mostly focus on offline analysis and diagnosis, and lack real-time interpretation and feedback mechanisms. For example, an EEG classification model may give results such as \"MCI risk\", but cannot explain exactly which cognitive functions are impaired and what interventions should be taken. It can be seen that a structured framework is needed in the field of brain-computer interface to associate low-level signal processing with high-level cognitive meaning, open up the \"sensory-cognitive\" chain, and integrate it with intervention methods in a closed loop.</p>\n<p><strong>2.2 Large models and intelligent diagnosis:</strong> After making breakthroughs in the field of natural language processing, large-scale pre-trained models (such as LLMs such as GPT) have been gradually introduced into the medical and health field. In the study of cognitive impairment, there are two main types of applications of large models: first, <strong>textual/linguistic analysis</strong>. Cognitive impairment is often accompanied by subtle changes in language ability, and researchers use pre-trained language models to analyze written or spoken text to detect signs of cognitive decline. For example, a study at Massachusetts General Hospital in the United States evaluated the performance of LLMs such as GPT-4 in identifying clues to cognitive decline in clinical notes in electronic health records (EHRs). By analyzing the fragments of physician records close to several years before the diagnosis of MCI, it was found that LLM was able to infer the cognitive state of patients from the few words that describe their daily life and memory through prompt learning, which complemented traditional neural network models. This suggests that LLMs have the ability to warn of cognitive problems in advance from unstructured text. Second, <strong>multimodal data fusion</strong>. Some scholars have explored the combination of LLM with brain imaging and genetic data to achieve cross-modal AD risk prediction. For example, a South Korean study using an LLM architecture that fused neuropsychological testing and MRI metrics to predict the risk of conversions to AD within two years in patients with MCI was reported to be significantly more accurate. The advantage of large models is that they have a wide range of knowledge coverage and strong reasoning ability, and are expected to act as an \"expert system\" or assistant in the cognitive field. However, its application also faces structural drawbacks: <strong>First</strong>, large models are inherently lacking in transparency and explainability, especially in medical contexts, where black-box decision-making is difficult to win the trust of doctors and patients. <strong>Second</strong>, generic large models may not be suitable for medical expertise, and direct use in diagnosis may lead to absurd conclusions (i.e., \"hallucinations\") or bias in the face of special populations. <strong>Thirdly</strong>, the current LLM mainly processes offline data and lacks an interface with real-time sensing data. There is also a lack of an active feedback mechanism to adjust the reasoning process according to the goal. In short, large models are still in the exploratory stage in the application of cognitive impairment, and they need to be combined with domain knowledge and feedback control to play a greater role.</p>\n<p><strong>2.3 Cognitive screening and digital assessment:</strong> Traditional cognitive screening methods, such as MMSE, MoCA and other scales, have been used for decades, and have been verified by large samples to form scoring categories and clinical decision-making criteria. In recent years, digital technology has gradually been recognized at home and abroad to improve the sensitivity and convenience of screening, and a variety of digital cognitive assessment schemes have emerged. For example, use a smartphone app to complete a cognitive test and upload the results for remote assessment. Through the computerized cognitive battery, the response time of the subject is captured under meticulous timing. Numerical representations were even extracted from data on the subject's daily life (e.g., voice, keyboard typing patterns) to predict cognitive risk. However, <strong>the current review shows that these new methods still do not fundamentally change the fragmented and static nature of screening: most digital screenings simply use electronic scales, are tested infrequently (usually every few months</strong>/years), and the outcome measures are still limited to continuously monitor subtle changes in the cognitive curve. At the same time, there is a disconnect between screening and intervention: there is a lack of targeted follow-up after the assessment, often requiring a referral to a physician or alternative training. This means that the role of screening is to \"find problems\" rather than \"solve them\". Some studies at home and abroad have tried the closed-loop <strong>screening-training model. For example, a start-up company in the United States has developed a game-based cognitive test, and if it detects a user's attention loss, it immediately recommends a corresponding brain training game to exercise attention. There are also teams in China that are exploring the combination of \"mini program self-test + music therapy</strong>/cognitive game\". However, most of these attempts stay in the logic of the application layer, lack of unified theoretical guidance, and the effect evaluation is not sufficient. Bottlenecks include: How can digital screening results be reliably mapped to clinical cognitive function? How to control the learning effect and subject motivation of multiple repeated tests? How can you choose an individualized intervention based on screening results rather than a \"one-size-fits-all\"? These problems show that the traditional screening paradigm alone cannot meet the needs of refined management, and a more intelligent evaluation system and intervention system need to be deeply integrated.</p>\n<p><strong>2.4 Virtual Reality and Cognitive Function Training:</strong> VR technology has attracted attention in the field of cognitive function rehabilitation due to its immersive and interactive advantages. Many studies have confirmed that VR cognitive training is more interesting and engaging than plane cognitive exercises, and can improve training compliance in elderly patients. Teams from abroad, such as South Korea and Canada, have developed VR games suitable for the elderly with MCI to practice memory, navigation, classification and other abilities, and have seen some improvement in standard cognitive tests after short-term intervention. Some scholars in China have also developed a \"VR+somatosensory\" cognitive rehabilitation system, which allows patients to complete daily tasks (such as supermarket shopping, bus rides) through virtual scenes to train their executive function and spatial memory. Some senior living communities in Beijing have piloted the introduction of VR memory training games into elderly care activities. These efforts have shown that VR is superior to traditional paper-and-pencil training in terms of ecological validity—patients are more likely to migrate to real-life situations with improved exposure to realistic situations. However, there are common structural defects in current VR cognitive training: First, there is insufficient personalization. Most VR training content is fixed, and it is difficult to dynamically adjust according to the cognitive weaknesses and progress speed of different patients. Although some systems provide difficulty selection, they often need to be adjusted by human judgment and lack intelligent adaptability. The second is the lack of physiological and cerebral feedback. The training process mainly collects the completion of behaviors, and there is no way to know the brain load and attention of patients during training. If the training task is too easy or too difficult, the system cannot sense and adjust the strategy in time. Third, the effect evaluation lags behind. The effect is usually evaluated by cognitive tests after the completion of the first phase of training, and this post-hoc evaluation cannot guide real-time optimization in the process. It can be seen that in order to achieve the maximum benefit, VR training needs to be combined with real-time monitoring and evaluation systems to form a closed loop of \"stimulus-response-evaluation-improvement\". This is precisely where the bottleneck of the current research lies, and it is also where this project intends to break through.</p>\n<p><strong>2.5 Comprehensive analysis of existing research methods:</strong> In summary, a large number of achievements have been made in the field of cognitive impairment detection and intervention at home and abroad, but in general, most of the studies are still limited to a single level or a one-way process: either focusing on signal acquisition and pattern recognition (data/information layerEither emphasizing the means of intervention and effect evaluation (wisdom level practice), there is a lack of a holistic view throughout. For example, a review pointed out that the current use of artificial intelligence in dementia care requires a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches. The DIKWP artificial consciousness model is proposed to fill this theoretical gap. It connects data, information, knowledge, wisdom and purpose from the perspective of systems theory and consciousness, which can be regarded as a paradigm shift in the application of artificial intelligence in cognitive impairment. As Professor Duan Yucong pointed out, \"By embedding the key layer of 'purpose' inside the model, we can not only make AI smarter, but also ensure that it always serves human values and safety needs.\" This means that the DIKWP model provides a new theoretical breakthrough: academically, it constructs a unified five-layer semantic architecture, integrating perception, cognition, decision-making, and goals that were previously separated; In terms of application, it provides an innovative way to solve the \"black box\" problem of the current large model, the interpretation problem of BCI, and the personalized problem of intervention. It is foreseeable that the application of the DIKWP artificial consciousness model to the early assessment and intervention of Alzheimer's disease is expected to form a new generation of intelligent diagnosis and treatment system and lead the breakthrough and development of this interdisciplinary field.</p>\n<h1 id=\"3-Research-objectives-and-research-content\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-Research-objectives-and-research-content\" title=\"3. Research objectives and research content\"></a><strong>3. Research objectives and research content</strong></h1><p>The overall goal of this project is to <strong>build an intelligent assessment, monitoring and intervention system for Alzheimer's disease (AD) driven by artificial consciousness based on the DIKWP model</strong>。 The system can perceive the cognitive state of patients at multiple levels, integrate the knowledge of large models for intelligent reasoning, formulate and adjust intervention strategies under the framework of artificial consciousness, and realize the comprehensive assessment, continuous monitoring and personalized intervention closed-loop of early AD population. In order to achieve this goal, the project will refine the research content into five modules according to the five-layer structure of DIKWP, and form a systematic research route from the \"data layer\" to the bottom layer and the \"purpose layer\" as the top layer. The research content and sub-objectives of each layer are as follows:</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-1-Data-Layer-Multimodal-Data-Acquisition-and-Signal-Flow-Design\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-1-Data-Layer-Multimodal-Data-Acquisition-and-Signal-Flow-Design\" title=\"3.1 Data Layer: Multimodal Data Acquisition and Signal Flow Design\"></a><strong>3.1 Data Layer: Multimodal Data Acquisition and Signal Flow Design</strong></h2><p><strong>Sub-objectives:</strong> Build a collection system covering cognitively relevant multimodal signals, formulate data stream processing specifications, and provide reliable and rich raw data input for the upper layer.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Contents:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Multimodal physiological and behavioral data collection: The</strong> data layer focuses on the capture of the patient's objective state of existence, which is equivalent to the \"senses\" of the artificial consciousness system. This project will integrate a variety of sensing channels, including: (1) Electroencephalography (<strong>EEG):</strong> Recording the electrical activity of the brain using high-density wearable EEG devices, focusing on EEG rhythms related to memory and attention (e.g., theta waves, α wave power) and functional connectivity indicators to reflect the functional status of neural networks. (2) Functional near-infrared (<strong>fNIRS):</strong> A portable fNIRS device is used to monitor the hemodynamic changes in brain regions such as the frontal lobe to evaluate the cerebral blood flow response under cognitive load such as executive function and working memory. The combination of the fNIRS signal with the EEG allows for complementary characterization of neural activity (one reflecting electrical signals and one reflecting blood oxygen). (3) Eye tracker: Infrared eye tracking collects information such as the subject's fixation point and pupil diameter. Eye movement features (e.g., fixation duration, saccade path) in cognitive tasks are a direct reflection of attention and information processing efficiency, and can assist in identifying early attention disorders. (4) Physiology and behavior: integrated heart rate variability (HRV) sensors, somatosensory accelerometers, etc., to record indicators related to cognitive status such as emotional agitation and slow movements. The whole system is optimized in terms of age-friendliness, such as the use of all-in-one wearable devices and wireless synchronous data collection, to ensure the naturalness and continuity of data acquisition.</p>\n<p><strong>Synchronous design of task scenarios and data:</strong> In order to give meaning to the collected data, this project will design a series of standardized cognitive task scenarios for subjects to perform multimodal data collection when completing tasks. Tasks include: memory (e.g., word list recall), attention (e.g., target stimulus monitoring), executive function (e.g., n-back working memory task), etc. These tasks can be presented in a computer or VR environment and the difficulty is automatically adjusted according to the subject's ability. The project will establish a time synchronization mechanism to accurately align task events (stimulus presentation, participant responses) with EEG, fNIRS, eye movement and other signals to generate annotated multimodal time series data. For example, in the n-back task, the time point of each stimulus and the time of the subject's key press will be recorded and associated with the corresponding brain signal fragment for subsequent analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Signal Pre-Processing &amp; Flow Control:</strong> Develop a unified data stream processing pipeline that includes: signal denoising (filtering, independent component analysis de-artifact), artifact removal (e.g., blinking, head movement artifact detection), data normalization, segmentation, and feature extraction. The project will develop online signal quality monitoring and pre-processing algorithms based on real-time processing requirements to ensure the reliability and stability of the data received by the upper layer. At the same time, the flow path of data within the system is planned: for example, EEG and fNIRS data are preprocessed and feature extracted on local edge computing devices, and then uploaded to a central server; Eye tracking and behavioral data is fed directly into the information layer module. Each data stream adopts <strong>the publish-subscribe mechanism, and dynamically adjusts the sampling rate and upload frequency according to the requirements issued by the purpose layer (for example, when the system purpose focuses on memory detection, increase the data sampling density of the channels related to the memory task). This kind of flow control realizes the response of the data layer to the purpose of the upper layer, so that the perception has a certain \"selectivity\", and reduces the transmission and processing load of irrelevant data.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Multi-modal data fusion interface:</strong> At the backend of the data layer, a multi-modal data fusion interface is established to align and store different types of data at the same time, so as to prepare for further processing in the information layer. For example, event-related potentials from EEG can be combined with fixation sequences of eye movements to form semantic-rich recordings (e.g., 0.3 seconds after stimulus X is presented, the subject produces a P300 wave and fixation is biased to the left). This interface also supports simple multimodal anomaly detection: if a sudden drop in data quality in one modality (e.g., electrode drop-off, signal loss) is found, it can notify the upper layer in time or trigger an alternate solution (e.g., temporarily relying more on other modalities). Through the above measures, the data layer will provide a comprehensive and robust perception foundation for the system, laying the foundation for intelligent processing at subsequent levels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-2-Information-layer-task-driven-and-perceptual-structure-docking-mechanism\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-2-Information-layer-task-driven-and-perceptual-structure-docking-mechanism\" title=\"3.2 Information layer: task-driven and perceptual structure docking mechanism\"></a><strong>3.2 Information layer: task-driven and perceptual structure docking mechanism</strong></h2><p><strong>Sub-objective:</strong> Transform the collected underlying data into meaningful information representations, and realize the initial perception of the subject's state and task-related semantic extraction.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Contents:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Signal Feature Extraction and Pattern Recognition: The</strong> information layer focuses on \"interpretation of data\", which is equivalent to processing and refining the original data into information units. This project will develop feature extraction algorithms and pattern recognition models for each modality at this layer, including: extracting spectral energy, relative power, coherence, event-related potential amplitude and other information from EEG that can indicate the stage of cognitive processes; Some features of the oxyhemoglobin curve extracted from fNIRS (e.g., the average rate of increase during the task period) indicate the level of activation of brain regions; Indicators such as average fixation duration and saccades were extracted from eye tracking data to reflect attention allocation; and task performance indicators such as reaction time and accuracy were extracted from behavioral records. These features will be fused with data, e.g. by concatenating simultaneous EEG and fNIRS features into a multimodal feature vector. Machine learning/deep learning models are then applied to perform pattern recognition on these features. Thanks to task annotation, the model can be trained as a classifier or regressor, such as to determine whether the current participant is normal or slightly impaired, or to estimate the current task load level. In particular, the project will develop real-time state detection algorithms, such as a cognitive load index based on EEG theta wave power, and an attentional fluctuation index based on saccade frequency, so that the system can have a quantitative understanding of the current cognitive state of the participant.</p>\n<p><strong>Task semantics and perceptual structure docking: The</strong> information layer not only processes data patterns, but also understands their meaning in combination with task contexts. To this end, we introduce task semantic modeling: establish a semantic description for each cognitive task, including the task goal (e.g., \"memorize the words that appear in the list\"), the step flow, the correct answer criteria, and so on. These descriptions constitute the \"information structure\" definition of the task. When the system is running, the information layer will connect the task structure with the perceptual data: for example, when a participant is detected to answer a question incorrectly in a memory task and the EEG theta rhythm is significantly increased, it can be interpreted as \"memory retrieval failure under high cognitive load\". This docking requires rules or simple inference mechanisms that map perceived patterns to task-specific semantic information. In this project**, ontology or knowledge graph is considered to represent the task structure and possible participant states. By linking \"task-action-physiological response-possible cognitive state\" in the knowledge graph, the semantic annotation of information is realized. For example, nodes represent \"memory tasks\", \"wrong answers\", \"theta wave rises\", etc., and connected edges represent logical relationships, such as \"θ rises** <em>and</em> <strong>errors -&gt; possible difficulties: insufficient working memory\". Based on this, the information layer outputs semantically rich perceptual information</strong>, such as \"the current working memory load is high, errors occur, and the memory ability is limited\".</p>\n<p><strong>Multimodal information fusion and visualization: The</strong> comprehensive presentation of multi-source information is another function of the information layer. On the one hand, the fusion algorithm is used to carry out confidence weighting or logic rule synthesis on the detection results from different modalities to obtain the overall judgment of the participant's state. For example, if an EEG indicates a decrease in attention and frequent blinking of the eye movement corroborates fatigue, the combined output is \"low attention and possibly fatigue\". On the other hand, the information layer is responsible for making machine-interpreted information available to the intelligence layer, doctors, or patients in interpretable form. This involves information visualization and report generation techniques. We will develop real-time dashboards that display key metrics such as real-time cognitive load curves, attention index light graphs, and task performance summaries. At the same time, the information layer can generate a summary report after the task is completed, for example: \"The average accuracy rate of the user in the memory task is 80%, which is 1 standard deviation lower than the norm; During this period, the theta wave was significantly elevated, suggesting that short-term memory storage is difficult.\" This information can be used for internal decision-making in the system and can also be used by experts for reference and validation.</p>\n<p><strong>Two-way interaction between the information layer and the data layer: The</strong> processing results of the information layer can in turn guide the data layer to tune and collect. For example, when the information layer detects \"poor signal quality\" or \"uncertain state\", it can request the data layer to increase the sampling rate or enable backup sensing (e.g., more reliance on fNIRS when there are many EEG artifacts). For another example, if the information layer identifies that the participant has difficulty responding to a certain type of stimulus, it can inform the data layer to focus on recording relevant data in the next task. Through this two-way interaction, <strong>a perceptual-interpretation cycle is formed</strong>: the data layer provides materials, and the information layer feeds back the needs, so that the low-level perception and high-level information extraction adapt to each other, and gradually improve the sensitivity of the system to the environment and the subject. This mechanism embodies the coupling of perception and cognition in the artificial consciousness system to ensure that information acquisition is consistent with the task goal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-3-Knowledge-layer-large-model-knowledge-fusion-and-personalized-cognitive-reasoning-module\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-3-Knowledge-layer-large-model-knowledge-fusion-and-personalized-cognitive-reasoning-module\" title=\"3.3 Knowledge layer: large model knowledge fusion and personalized cognitive reasoning module\"></a><strong>3.3 Knowledge layer: large model knowledge fusion and personalized cognitive reasoning module</strong></h2><p><strong>Sub-objective: To</strong> build a cognitive reasoning module that integrates large-scale pre-trained models and domain knowledge, which can absorb general medical knowledge and individual characteristics, and achieve in-depth understanding and prediction of subject status.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Contents:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>General Medical Knowledge Base and Ontology Construction: The</strong> knowledge layer is the systematic brain \"memory\" that carries a lot of background knowledge about Alzheimer's disease and cognitive science. The project will first build an Alzheimer's disease knowledge base, including disease mechanisms, cognitive function architecture, assessment scale knowledge, interventions, etc. Information sources can be existing knowledge graphs (e.g., AD-related concepts in UMLS), medical guidelines, and scientific literature. This part of knowledge is organized in the form of ontology and knowledge graph, and the key nodes such as \"hippocampus-memory\", \"acetylcholine-neurotransmitter\", \"cognitive training-plasticity\", etc., include cause and effect, association, subordination, etc. This provides an expert semantic network for interpreting the state of the system and planning interventions.</p>\n<p><strong>Large model knowledge fusion:</strong> On this basis, large pre-trained models (<strong>LLMs) are introduced to enrich the inference ability of the knowledge layer. LLM has been trained in a large number of corpora, contains a wide range of language and common sense, and has a good understanding of texts such as descriptions of cognitive impairment and medical history. In the project, we will use a large Chinese model such as GPT-4 or Chinese based (medical specific models need to be considered) and adapt it to the domain</strong>. This is done by prompting learning or fine-tuning to enable the model to: (1) answer questions about AD and cognitive function based on the knowledge base (e.g., \"What brain regions may be caused by decreased function of sustained attention?\"). “）； (2) provide interpretation of multimodal information for specific patients (e.g., generate an analysis report based on input cognitive test results + EEG characteristics); and (3) assisted decision support (listing optional interventions for a certain cognitive impairment, etc.). In order to avoid the illusion of large models, the knowledge layer will adopt the Retrieval Enhanced Generation (RAG) framework: that is, before the LLM generates inference, the relevant fragments are retrieved from the knowledge base as contextual hints to ensure that the model answers are based on authoritative knowledge. For example, when a model is needed to evaluate a patient's status, it first searches the knowledge base for \"MCI definitions\" and \"cognitive training methods\", and then provides the LLM with the patient's information for comprehensive responses. Through this deep integration, the knowledge layer is equivalent to an <strong>intelligent assistant that \"has massive medical knowledge and can understand the context</strong>\", which greatly enhances the reasoning depth of the system.</p>\n<p><strong>Personalized cognitive model and digital twin: The</strong> knowledge layer not only contains general knowledge, but also gradually accumulates specific knowledge for each individual, so as to form a \"personalized cognitive model\". The project will build a \"<strong>cognitive digital twin\" for each participant</strong>: a subgraph of individual knowledge maintained at the knowledge layer, recording the person's background and previous interactions. Such as family genetic history, education level, baseline cognitive assessment results, performance curves for each training session, response to different interventions, etc. This information is constantly updated, giving the system a more and more complete picture of the individual. Based on this, the knowledge layer can invoke different inference paths for the same task and different people. For example, for an elderly person with visual impairment, the system \"knows\" that their visual perception test results are chronically low, which reduces the importance of visual test results in reasoning and reminds the intelligence layer to consider visual compensation (which is a knowledge adjustment for individuals with different attributes). In addition, digital twins can be used to simulate predictions: the system can internally adjust certain parameters to estimate how a person's cognitive indicators would change if an intervention was taken, in order to assess the potential for intervention. This is similar to a doctor's prediction of a patient's likely progress based on past experience, except that the knowledge layer is based on cumulative data and large model reasoning. This personalized cognitive reasoning module will give the system a \"growing understanding of you\" for each person, realizing true individualized intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong>Inference and Interpretation Mechanism: The</strong> knowledge layer will implement an inference engine, which will comprehensively use ontology rules and large models for cognitive state assessment and reasoning of intervention suggestions. Reasoning styles include deductive (e.g., rule-based: if short-term memory test scores drop and theta waves increase significantly, \"working memory declines\"), inductive (based on past data, someone's pattern is similar to cases where previous interventions worked), and analogy (large models make recommendations based on similar textual cases). It is important that the reasoning process of the knowledge layer is transparent and explainable to the upper layer. To do this, we will record the chain of inference, especially when the LLM participates, capturing the intermediate thought steps. For example, before LLM can draw conclusions, we ask them to list the causes and rationale, which will be translated into structured explanations (e.g., \"Based on a 20% persistent decline in memory scores and a 50% increase in EEGθ waves above baseline in the last 3 months, combined with the findings from literature X, it is determined that memory deterioration is rapid, possibly due to hippocampal degeneration\"). These explanations serve as knowledge evidence to provide reference for decision-making at the intelligence layer, and also improve the credibility of the system. Through perfect knowledge fusion and reasoning, the knowledge layer will play the role of a smart brain in the whole system, providing a solid basis for complex cognitive judgment and strategy formulation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-4-Intelligence-layer-feedback-adjustment-and-strategy-evaluation-system-based-on-artificial-consciousness\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-4-Intelligence-layer-feedback-adjustment-and-strategy-evaluation-system-based-on-artificial-consciousness\" title=\"3.4 Intelligence layer: feedback adjustment and strategy evaluation system based on artificial consciousness\"></a><strong>3.4 Intelligence layer: feedback adjustment and strategy evaluation system based on artificial consciousness</strong></h2><p><strong>Sub-goal: To</strong> realize the \"smart\" functional module of the artificial consciousness system, which is responsible for integrating knowledge for decision-making, dynamically adjusting intervention strategies, and evaluating the effect, and continuously optimizing in the closed loop.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Contents:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Comprehensive assessment and decision-making of cognitive state: The</strong> intelligence layer is equivalent to the decision-making center in the artificial consciousness system. It receives an assessment of an individual's current cognitive state and long-term trends, as well as recommendations for potential intervention options, and then makes intelligent decisions based on this—i.e., the selection of appropriate action strategies. Specifically, this project will develop a comprehensive cognitive state assessment model at the wisdom layer: synthesize multi-dimensional information from the knowledge layer (memory ability rating, attention ability rating, emotional state, etc.) to generate a quantitative representation of the patient's overall state (such as a cognitive health index of 0-100), and judge the current major problems (such as \"short-term memory is significantly lower than the population average\", \"depression may affect cognition\"). On this basis, the intelligent layer calls the policy library to select the intervention action. The strategy library includes a variety of possible measures, such as: adjusting the difficulty of the training (increasing/decreasing the difficulty of the task), changing the type of training (memory-&gt; attention), increasing rest or motivation, suggesting medication counseling or referrals, etc. Decision-making at the intelligence level uses certain optimization criteria, such as the expectation of maximizing cognitive improvement or multi-objective balance (both improving memory and not lowering mood). It can be modeled as a multi-armed gambling machine or a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem, and reinforcement learning can be used to learn the optimal strategy from the interaction history. Examples of decisions made by the intelligence layer include: \"In view of the user's recent slow progress and increased fatigue on memory tasks, it was decided to reduce the frequency of memory tasks and add fun games to increase engagement\"; \"After this training, the attention index was still low, and it was decided to trigger an EEG neurofeedback training to enhance attention\", etc. Through the wisdom layer, the system transforms knowledge into practical action, realizing the leap from \"knowledge\" to \"action\".</p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Consciousness Feedback Modulation Mechanism: The</strong> intelligence layer is unique in that it does not enforce fixed rules, but has the ability to self-feedback and regulate—an important representation of artificial consciousness. We will introduce a \"dual loop\" architecture, that is, in addition to the basic perception-decision loop described above, add a metacognitive loop. Metacognitive cycles are initiated by the intelligence layer to monitor and regulate the effects of the basic cycles. For example, the intelligence layer continuously monitors the implementation of intervention strategies: if the desired improvement is not achieved, or if there is a negative impact (such as user abandonment due to increased training difficulty), the metacognitive module of the intelligence layer will identify this bias. It then reflects on the adequacy of the basis for the decision, whether there are any omissions in the knowledge reasoning, and may retrieve more information or update the model parameters through the knowledge layer. Then, the intelligence layer adjusts the decision-making strategy in the future to avoid the recurrence of similar problems. This cycle of self-monitoring-reflection-regulation allows the system to gradually improve. To put it simply, the intelligence layer is not only concerned about the effect of current decisions on patients, but also evaluates the quality of their own decisions and continuously learns and improves. In terms of technical implementation, the metacognitive module can record the data of each decision and its consequences, use machine learning methods to find out the pattern of decision errors, and refer to it in subsequent decisions (such as increasing penalties). Through this feedback adjustment, the system has a certain ability to \"introspect\", just as humans will reflect on their own judgment and do better next time.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategy evaluation and effect prediction:</strong> In order to achieve a true closed loop, the intelligence layer needs to evaluate its effect after each round of intervention and feed back the results to the data layer and the knowledge layer to form a complete loop. The project will develop an effect evaluation model at the intelligence layer: on a short-term scale, the immediate effect will be evaluated based on the data during the training process (such as changes in task performance and trends in physiological indicators), such as whether the attention index increases after an attention training, and whether the heart rate decreases indicates an increase in concentration. On the medium to long-term scale, periodic assessments (e.g., weekly MoCA tests or memory tests) are used to verify whether the overall cognitive trend is improving. For example, if the system decides to focus on memory training for a month, the memory score is reassessed after one month to see if there is a statistically significant improvement. The intelligence layer compares these evaluation results with the original expected goals and outputs a score of the strategy effect. If a strategy works less than expected, the intelligence layer will mark the strategy as less suitable under similar conditions, and will tend to choose other options in the future (which is also part of metacognitive moderation). Conversely, if the effect is outstanding, the strategy pattern is reinforced. At the same time, the intelligence layer can use the knowledge layer to make predictions about the potential effect to assist decision-making. For example, knowledge-based simulations show that continuing the current training regimen for two months improves memory by 5%, while switching to another regimen may improve memory by 8% with increased fatigue. Then the wisdom layer evaluates the pros and cons accordingly and may choose to adjust. In the continuous evaluation-prediction cycle, the system realizes adaptive optimization: towards the predetermined cognitive improvement goal, the path is dynamically adjusted to approach the goal as quickly and stably as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Safety Monitoring and Ethical Constraints: The</strong> decision-making of the intelligent layer is always monitored by the safety and ethics module to ensure that the behavior of the artificial consciousness system is in line with medical ethics and the interests of patients. This module includes pre-set rules of restraint (e.g., not to cause excessive stress to training, not to give medical diagnosis or medication advice without going to a doctor), and values (e.g., prioritizing patient dignity and privacy). When the intelligence layer makes a policy such as \"increase training intensity\", the security module will review whether the security threshold (such as the total training time limit per day) is exceeded. If violated, execution will be rejected and adjustments will be prompted. In terms of ethics, the intelligence layer needs to maintain empathy and respect when interacting with patients, such as refraining from the use of cognitive comments and not hurting patients' self-esteem. This can be achieved through ethical knowledge in the knowledge base and tone control in LLMs. The safety and ethics module is equivalent to the \"superego\" of the system, providing value orientation in the closed loop of artificial consciousness and ensuring that the application of technology in medical care does not deviate from the right track.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-5-Purpose-layer-cognitive-goal-guidance-and-individual-state-reconstruction-mechanism\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-5-Purpose-layer-cognitive-goal-guidance-and-individual-state-reconstruction-mechanism\" title=\"3.5 Purpose layer: cognitive goal guidance and individual state reconstruction mechanism\"></a><strong>3.5 Purpose layer: cognitive goal guidance and individual state reconstruction mechanism</strong></h2><p><strong>Sub-objectives:</strong> To achieve the \"intention\" function at the top level of the system, set clear cognitive rehabilitation goals, dominate the overall strategic direction, and provide goal reference for the lower levels by reconstructing individual states.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Contents:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cognitive Rehabilitation Goal Setting: The</strong> purpose layer is responsible for determining the ultimate purpose of the system's operation. Based on the experience of clinical experts and the needs of patients, this project will set several levels of goals at the purpose level: the overall goal is to \"delay the progression of Alzheimer's disease and maintain and improve the cognitive function of patients\". This overarching goal can be broken down into a number of specific, quantifiable sub-goals, such as \"no more than 5% decline in memory score in one year\" or \"improvement in daily living ability score of 3 points\". Shorter-term goals such as: \"This month's main attack will increase the attention span to more than 5 minutes\". These goals range from hard indicators such as cognitive test scale scores to soft indicators such as \"improvement in patients' subjective well-being\". The purpose layer uses this as an evaluation criterion to guide the work of each layer towards the goal. For example, when the overall goal is memory-focused, the intelligence layer will tilt the choice of memory tasks when weighing multi-task training. These goals are scientifically based on the program team and can be individualized to the patient (e.g., the goal is to regain work capacity in young patients with MCI and the goal is to maintain daily independence in older patients). Intentions can be updated as conditions change, but remain clear over a period of time, providing a steady direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Individual state of consciousness reconstruction:</strong> Another key function of the intentional layer is to <strong>reconstruct and model the overall conscious/cognitive state of the individual</strong>. This \"reconstruction\" refers to the formation of a high-level abstraction of the patient's current cognitive and psychological state within the system, almost similar to the internal simulation of the patient's \"mind\" by the system. This can be seen as a \"subjective projection\" of artificial consciousness to the user. The implementation method is to extract several core state variables on the basis of the output of the integrated intelligence layer and the digital twin of the knowledge layer, such as: \"cognitive vitality\" (reflecting the overall cognitive health), \"learning motivation\", \"emotional stability\", \"behavior compliance\", etc. The purpose layer scores or describes these high-level states by analyzing all recent data and decision results. For example, after a series of tasks, the system may reconstruct the following: \"Current user cognitive vitality = medium (down 2 points from the previous month), learning motivation = low, emotion = good, adherence = high\". This reconstructed state helps the system understand that the user may have been slacking off recently and needs to be motivated by more interesting tasks; The mood is good, and the challenge can be appropriately increased, etc. In the reconstruction process, with the help of LLM's ability to summarize and summarize multi-modal information, the complex data is sublimated into high-level semantics. The purpose layer regularly updates this internal state model, allowing the system to form an evolving mental portrait of the user.</p>\n<p><strong>Global Intent-Driven Coordination:</strong> With clear goals and a high-level understanding of the user, the purpose layer acts like the \"commander\" of the system, signaling the global drive to the lower layers. This drive is manifested in the following aspects: (1) Task priority allocation: according to the current intent, decide the type of task and data to focus on next. For example, if the goal is to improve attention, the instruction information layer and the intelligence layer will devote more resources to the evaluation and training of attention-related tasks, and the data layer can also enhance the relevant data collection according to the instructions. (2) Resource and parameter control: The purpose layer can macroscopically adjust some parameters of the system, such as the total training time and the maximum number of tasks per day, to coordinate them with the goal. If the user is showing fatigue and the purpose is to persist for a long time, the purpose layer may give instructions to \"reduce the time per training session but increase the frequency\". (3) Emergency purpose handling: If the knowledge layer finds some emergency situation (such as a sharp deterioration of cognitive ability or the risk of emotional collapse), the purpose layer can instantly raise the priority of the corresponding target and trigger an emergency strategy (such as immediately notifying the clinician to intervene). Together, the purpose layer uses these means to twist the parts of the system together to ensure that all decisions are made around the end goal.</p>\n<p><strong>Human-machine collaboration and subjectivity maintenance: It</strong> is worth emphasizing that the purpose layer should also fully consider the patient's own wishes and human-computer collaboration when setting goals. That is, the purpose of the artificial consciousness system needs to be in line with the purpose of the person. To this end, the project will involve patients and their families in the goal-setting process (e.g., interviews to get the features they care about most) and design an interface to let patients understand the goals of the system and recommendations for adjustments. If the patient rejects a training or goal, the system needs to make compromises. This prevents the AI from forcibly pursuing certain metrics and ignoring human feelings. Finally, through intent-level coordination, the unity of machine intelligence and human purpose is realized: the ultimate purpose of the system is to help patients achieve their desired state of health. In this process, patients gradually benefit from the system and feedback their own subjective experience, forming a positive cycle of human-centeredness.</p>\n<p>Through the layer-by-layer research and integration of the above five-layer modules, this project will theoretically build the structure of the DIKWP artificial consciousness-driven cognitive <strong>assessment-intervention system. At each layer, we not only carry out methodological innovation, but also pay attention to the interface and collaboration between the upper and lower layers to ensure the integrity and closed-loop nature of the entire system architecture. On this basis, we will further elaborate on how each module connects and forms a closed-loop driving logic in the technical roadmap section, as well as the main innovation points of the project.</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"4-The-technical-route-and-innovation-points\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-The-technical-route-and-innovation-points\" title=\"4. The technical route and innovation points\"></a><strong>4. The technical route and innovation points</strong></h1><p>This project takes the five-layer structure of DIKWP artificial consciousness as the core engine, builds a complete technical route according to the chain of \"data→ information→ knowledge→ wisdom → intention\", and realizes layer-by-layer feedback through two-way coupling, forming a closed-loop driving logic from data to intent. Figure 1 (omitted) illustrates the overall architecture and information flow direction of the project system: the underlying sensors collect multimodal data, which is converted into task-related information through pattern recognition at the information layer, the knowledge layer integrates domain knowledge for advanced reasoning, the intelligence layer makes intervention decisions and evaluates the effect accordingly, and the top purpose layer provides goal guidance and global coordination. At the same time, there is bottom-up information transmission and top-down control feedback between each layer, and the interaction between the two layers constitutes a network coupling relationship. This multi-layered cyclic system breaks through the traditional linear input-processing-output model, making the system human-like flexible and adaptable.</p>\n<p><strong>The technical route is described in steps as follows:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Data acquisition and preprocessing (corresponding to the data layer):</strong> In the real application scenario, elderly subjects wear equipment such as EEG and fNIRS to enter the virtual reality or computer cognitive training environment. The system first collects multi-modal data according to the predetermined scheme, and performs preprocessing and feature extraction in real time. This step solves the problem of \"objective perception\" and provides a rich and reliable source material. The innovation lies in the closed-loop data acquisition of multimodal fusion: we have designed a mechanism to dynamically adjust sampling and sensing according to the needs of the task, so that the perception process is no longer passive, but driven by high-level needs, reflecting a certain \"attention\" allocation function (the preliminary feature of artificial consciousness).</p>\n<p><strong>Pattern Recognition and Information Generation (corresponding to the information layer): The</strong> acquired data stream is fed into the information layer for pattern recognition. Through machine learning models and task semantic rules, the system maps low-level signal patterns into meaningful information (metrics, events). This stage is equivalent to mimicking the process of interpreting sensory signals in the human cerebral cortex. The innovation of the technical route lies in task-driven information extraction: instead of looking at the signal in isolation, it refines the information in combination with the current task situation. For example, the same theta wave enhancement has different meanings in the memory task and attention task, and the system can distinguish and assign corresponding semantics. This contextual awareness makes the information layer output more useful to the upper layer.</p>\n<p><strong>Intelligent reasoning and knowledge fusion (corresponding to the knowledge layer):</strong> The information layer output is submitted to the knowledge layer along with historical data and a series of background knowledge. The knowledge layer uses large models and knowledge graphs to conduct comprehensive reasoning on the current state of subjects, form a diagnostic assessment of cognitive function and analysis of potential causes, and retrieve appropriate intervention knowledge. This step is equivalent to an AI \"expert\" analyzing the data and making recommendations. The innovations include: <em>(a)</em> <strong>deep integration of large model + knowledge graph</strong>: we let LLM reason under knowledge constraints to ensure the accuracy and relevance of answers; <em>(b)</em> <strong>Individual digital twins</strong>: The knowledge layer not only has general medical knowledge, but also individual-specific models, so that the reasoning can truly be differentiated from person to person. This gives the system a greater degree of customization than traditional expert systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Decision-making and strategy execution (corresponding to the wisdom layer):</strong> Based on the judgment and suggestions provided by the knowledge layer, the intelligence layer optimizes the decision and selects the best intervention strategy. The policy is then sent to the underlying level for execution (e.g., controlling the difficulty of the VR situation, switching tasks, etc.) to intervene on the user. At the same time, the intelligent layer monitors the execution process and evaluates the immediate effect. This link closes the \"sense-decision-act\" loop, allowing the system to have an impact on the environment. The innovations are reflected in: <em>(a)</em> <strong>closed-loop decision-making</strong>: Different from the traditional open-loop system, we introduce reinforcement learning and other mechanisms to allow AI to continuously update strategies according to the implementation effect, so as to achieve adaptive evolution of decision-making; <em>(b)</em> <strong>Metacognitive feedback</strong>: The intelligence layer evaluates the effectiveness of its own decisions, and requests more information from the knowledge layer or adjusts the model parameters if necessary. This is equivalent to the self-reflection of artificial consciousness, so that the system can gradually optimize the quality of decision-making.</p>\n<p><strong>Objective management and global governance (corresponding to the purpose layer):</strong> The highest level of intent, the purpose layer, continuously monitors whether the entire system is operating towards the set goals. If deviations are detected, such as cognitive function not improving or even worsening, the purpose layer will change the targeting strategy (e.g., extend the project time, adjust the main target area) and notify the levels to reconfigure. At the same time, the purpose layer communicates with users/clinical experts about target modifications to ensure that system goals meet human expectations. The innovation at this level is to clearly implant the human goal orientation into the AI system, so as to form a closed loop that is guided by the goal and runs through the top and bottom. Traditional AI systems usually do not have an internal target concept, but the DIKWP system achieves this through the purpose layer, so that the processing of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom all revolves around the target service. This is a unique advantage of the artificial consciousness model.</p>\n<p>In the process of realizing the above technical routes, this project will focus on the following innovations:</p>\n<p><strong>(Innovation point 1) The first application of artificial consciousness closed-loop architecture in the medical field:</strong> This project will take the lead in applying the DIKWP artificial consciousness model to Alzheimer's disease assessment and intervention scenarios, and build a <strong>full-link closed-loop system of perception-cognition-decision-intention. This architecture breaks through the current one-way process-based model of medical AI and realizes the self-regulation and evolution of the system. In particular, the introduction of the dual-cycle structure</strong> (cognitive cycle + metacognitive cycle) has made the system initially have a prototype of self-consciousness. This is a groundbreaking exploration in the world, heralding the leap from automation to autonomous intelligence in intelligent medical systems.</p>\n<p><strong>(Innovation point 2) Intelligent semantic fusion of multi-source heterogeneous data:</strong> The project creatively integrates brain signals, physiological data and cognitive task semantics, and contextualizes pattern recognition by the information layer. This kind of fusion is different from general multimodal fusion, which is not only the superposition of the data level, but also gives meaning to the data at the semantic level, which greatly improves the explanatory and decision-making relevance. For example, the system can explain \"why this mission failed\" by combining the EEG and the task requirements to provide a cause analysis, rather than just outputting a failure label. This intelligent semantic fusion greatly improves AI's ability to understand complex clinical phenomena.</p>\n<p><strong>(Innovation point 3) Personalized cognitive reasoning driven by large models:</strong> We introduce large models (such as GPT) as one of the core inference engines at the knowledge layer, and overcome its black box and hallucination problems through knowledge injection and structured prompts. More importantly, the project introduces the concept of digital twins, allowing the large model to be \"customized thinking\" for each user. At present, there are few studies on the use of LLMs for tracking and reasoning of individuals' continuous cognitive states, and our solution allows LLMs to truly become \"AI confidants\" of patients, accumulating over time to understand their characteristics and provide tailored suggestions. This is a major advance in the management of cognitive impairment by AI, making it possible to humanize artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong>(Innovation point 4) Interpretable and controllable cognitive operating system prototype:</strong> The project is committed to realizing the concept of \"embedding DIKWP into AI to form a semantic operating system\" proposed by Professor Duan Yucong. In our system, every step of the process, from data to intent, has a clear meaning and can be traced back. By monitoring the inference link of the LLM at the intelligence layer and defining a five-layer semantic mapping at the knowledge layer, we have created a human-friendly cognitive operation platform that allows doctors and researchers to see how AI draws conclusions and decisions step by step. This kind of white-box AI is particularly important in medical care, which directly solves the \"black box\" problem of deep learning and improves the reliability of the system. Technically, this is also a highlight of the artificial consciousness system: man and machine share the same cognitive language and logic.</p>\n<p><strong>(Innovation point 5) Novel adaptive control strategy in the field of cognitive intervention:</strong> This project combines reinforcement learning with artificial consciousness to create a goal-driven cognitive intervention control method. In the past, cognitive training mostly used fixed protocols or simple performance-based adjustments, and lacked systematic optimization. The intent-based reinforcement learning we implement at the intelligence layer enables the system to explore the best intervention path through trial and error, while ensuring that it does not deviate from the rehabilitation goals set by humans. This self-optimized intervention strategy is proposed for the first time in the field of AD rehabilitation, and is expected to significantly improve the intervention effect and efficiency. For example, the system may find that for a certain type of patient, \"short-frequency multiple\" training is more effective than \"long-term concentration\", and it will automatically tend to the former. This is similar to adaptive control in AI physical control, but it is applied to a complex system such as human cognition, which is a cross-domain innovation.</p>\n<p><strong>(Innovation point 6) Artificial intelligence ethics and human-oriented integration practice:</strong> While pursuing technological breakthroughs, this project focuses on integrating ethical considerations into technical solutions. We ensure that AI decision-making is always centered on the interests of patients through the value constraints of the purpose layer and the safety supervision of the intelligence layer. In the system design, patients and experts are involved in goal setting to achieve human-machine collaboration. These explorations set the benchmark for responsible innovation in the application of AI in healthcare. In particular, on the frontier of artificial consciousness participation in decision-making, we have formulated clear ethical norms to make AI not only intelligent but also kind, and promote the implementation of AI ethical governance in specific medical products.</p>\n<p>Through the implementation of the above technical routes and the realization of innovation points, this project is expected to promote the deep integration of artificial consciousness theory and brain health in academics, establish a new paradigm of intelligent cognitive impairment intervention system in technology, and provide breakthrough tools for early intervention of Alzheimer's disease in application. Next, we will introduce the project team and basic conditions to prove that we have the strength and resources to complete the above research.</p>\n<h1 id=\"5-Project-team-and-basic-conditions\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#5-Project-team-and-basic-conditions\" title=\"5.

Prof. Yucong Duan is the originator of the DIKWP artificial consciousness model and an international leader in the field. <strong>Professor Duan Yucong is currently a Corresponding Member of the National Academy of Artificial Intelligence of the United States, a Foreign Academician of the National Academy of Sciences of Serbia, an Academician of the International Academy of Advanced Technology and Engineering, and the Chairman of the World Association of Artificial Consciousness.</strong> In terms of the basic theory of artificial intelligence, Professor Duan has long been committed to the research of cognitive computing and semantic technology, and was shortlisted in the top 2% of the world's top scientists in 2022. He took the lead in proposing \"intent/purpose\" as the core of AI architecture, and established a mesh DIKWP model to achieve two-way feedback and iterative update of semantics at all layers. This theory is an international milestone and has become a new way to solve the problem of black box and AI interpretability of large models. As the first inventor, Professor Duan has been granted 114 invention patents, including 15 PCT international patents, covering many cutting-edge fields such as large model training, artificial consciousness construction, cognitive operating system, AI governance, and privacy security. These patents form a complete intellectual property portfolio of the DIKWP technology system. For example, his patent proposes a \"dual circulation\" artificial consciousness architecture and introduces metacognitive self-monitoring, which is regarded as an important way to give AI initial self-awareness. In addition, a number of patents embed the DIKWP model into the LLM inference process to create an interpretable semantic operating system. and innovative solutions for multimodal semantic graph coupling and LLM hallucination prevention and control. These technical achievements have laid a solid foundation for this project. Professor Duan has recently presided over and participated in a number of national projects, published dozens of papers in top international journals, and participated in the development of 2 IEEE international standards for financial knowledge graph and 4 industry knowledge graph standards. Other core members of the team include: cognitive neuroscience experts, who are good at the application of EEG/imaging technology in cognitive aging; Medical informatics expert, responsible for fine-tuning the field of medical knowledge graph and LLM; Software engineering expert, responsible for system integration and platform development, etc. This combination of disciplines ensures that the team can collaborate efficiently across the entire chain, from artificial consciousness theory to algorithm development to medical applications.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Accumulation of technology in artificial consciousness modeling: The</strong> team has conducted in-depth research and achievements in the theory and practice of the DIKWP artificial consciousness model. In addition to theoretical papers and patents, we have developed prototype systems of the DIKWP architecture and successfully validated the application possibilities in medical and other fields. For example, the team built the world's first artificial consciousness prototype system, applied DIKWP to human-computer interaction in gout diagnosis and treatment, and realized the intelligent Q&amp;A and solution suggestions of physician assistant AI on patients' symptoms. In this prototype, the data layer perceives the patient's symptom data, the knowledge layer invokes the medical knowledge base, the wisdom layer gives the diagnosis and treatment plan, and the purpose layer ensures that the AI decision-making complies with medical standards. The whole process fully reflects the synergy of all levels of artificial consciousness and achieves good results. This provides valuable lessons for us to extend similar architectures to Alzheimer's disease scenarios. In addition, the team also explored the application of the DIKWP model in the fields of traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis and treatment, industrial control, etc. For example, we simulated the whole process of diagnosis and treatment of cold-pharyngitis-bronchitis in TCM based on DIKWP, and proved that the artificial consciousness system can handle complex multi-stage decision-making. These cross-domain cases show the universality and portability of the DIKWP model, and also exercise the team's ability to model different knowledge systems.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Knowledge structure generation and semantic technology advantages: The</strong> team has strong strength in the direction of knowledge graph and semantic computing. Professor Duan Yucong also serves as the vice president of Hainan Invention Association, and leads the team to build knowledge graphs and ontologies in various vertical fields. For example, the international standard project for financial knowledge graphs in which we participated involved involved the construction of huge semantic networks and inference methods, which cultivated our ability to deal with complex knowledge structures. In terms of medical knowledge, our members have participated in the construction project of the TCM encephalopathy knowledge base of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and are familiar with medical ontology and clinical semantic data. In addition, the \"semantic mathematics\" method developed by the team can mathematically express the conceptual relationships in the knowledge graph and support computational reasoning. These technical reserves will contribute to the construction of the Alzheimer's disease knowledge base and cognitive ontology in this project, as well as the realization of the combination of knowledge and large models. In particular, the RDXS relational definition semantic model (a unified semantic framework proposed by Professor Duan) can map incomplete and inconsistent information to the DIKWP graph to achieve multi-source knowledge fusion. This is helpful for dealing with the complexities of real-world medical data.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Experience in the development of cognitive regulation systems:</strong> The team also has relevant foundations in cognitive training systems and human-computer interaction. Our engineering team has developed the \"Brain Health Training\" APP, which includes attention training games and memory training tasks, etc., and has first-hand experience of user interface friendliness and motivation mechanisms for the elderly. The team has also cooperated with local hospitals in Hainan to carry out small-scale experiments on cognitive intervention for MCI patients, and is familiar with cognitive assessment methods (such as MoCA, RBANS scales) and statistical analysis methods of intervention effects. This will help us to carry out system validation and performance evaluation in this project. The team is equipped with talents with biomedical engineering background, with experience in near-infrared brain imaging equipment and 64-conduction EEG acquisition system, which can successfully build the data acquisition hardware environment of this project. At the same time, we have young PhDs involved in VR development, who can design targeted VR task scenarios based on the principles of cognitive science to ensure that the intervention content is both scientifically effective and interesting and practical. In addition, the team has established contacts with many hospitals and elderly care institutions in China, and can recruit volunteers for early AD population to carry out systematic testing in the later stage of the project. These resources and preliminary work provide the necessary conditions to support the implementation of the project.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Infrastructure and supporting conditions:</strong> The team provides a good scientific research environment and conditions for the project. Relying on the laboratory platform of the School of Computer Science, we have high-performance computing servers (GPU clusters) for large model fine-tuning and deep learning training. There is a dedicated cognitive neuroscience lab for EEG/behavioral experiments, equipped with an electromagnetic shielded room to improve signal quality. The university library and e-resources provide access to a wealth of medical and AI literature, which facilitates our cross-cutting research. The team also received special financial support from the Hainan Provincial Department of Science and Technology, which can be used to purchase the required software and hardware (such as portable fNIRS cameras, VR headsets, psychological experiment software, etc.). In addition, the team has established a clinical research center with a local tertiary hospital, which can facilitate translational medical research. We plan to set up a clinical trial site in the geriatric department of the hospital in the middle of the project to verify the actual effect of the developed system, and this process will be strongly supported by the cooperation channel between the university and the hospital.</p>\n<p>In summary, the project team has outstanding advantages and rich accumulation in artificial consciousness modeling, knowledge graph, intelligent system research and development, etc. We not only have top-notch theoretical guidance, but also a solid engineering and clinical foundation, and we have a tacit understanding of cross-disciplinary integration. The school and relevant units provided the necessary venues, equipment and financial conditions. All these will ensure the smooth development of the research work of this project and provide a strong guarantee for the achievement of the expected goals.</p>\n<h1 id=\"6-Expected-results-and-transformation-paths\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#6-Expected-results-and-transformation-paths\" title=\"6. Expected results and transformation paths\"></a><strong>6. Expected results and transformation paths</strong></h1><p>This project aims to generate significant scientific outputs and practical value. The expected results include theoretical innovation achievements, technology implementation achievements and application demonstration achievements, and on this basis, a clear path for the transformation and promotion of achievements will be formulated to help the national smart medical care and aging health.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Theoretical innovations:</strong> At the scientific level, this project will refine and verify the applicability of DIKWP artificial consciousness theory in the field of cognitive impairment assessment intervention, and is expected to form high-level academic papers and monographs. For example, we will summarize the methods used by artificial consciousness systems to model early cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease and publish them in top journals of artificial intelligence or neural engineering, filling the research gap in the application of artificial consciousness in digital health. We also plan to refine the conceptual framework of \"cognitive closed-loop intervention\" and form industry reports or monographs to provide theoretical reference for future smart elderly care and cognitive impairment intervention. In addition, through the project research, new interdisciplinary topics (such as \"artificial consciousness + digital neuromedicine\") may be expanded, and these theoretical explorations will consolidate China's leading position in the field of basic theories of artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Technical Achievement:</strong> At the engineering level, this project will deliver a prototype system of artificial consciousness for early assessment, monitoring and intervention of Alzheimer's disease. The system includes: multi-modal data acquisition hardware suite (EEG cap, fNIRS armband, eye tracker, VR glasses, etc.), back-end intelligent analysis and decision-making software platform, and user interface application. We will apply for software copyrights and invention patents for the system, and it is expected to form a patent group covering core innovations such as the cognitive evaluation method based on DIKWP, the adaptive method of training tasks driven by artificial awareness, and the operating system architecture of medical artificial consciousness. These independent intellectual property rights will lay the foundation for industrialization. In terms of specific technical indicators, the system should achieve the expected effects of increasing the accuracy of the subject's cognitive state assessment by more than 20% <strong>(compared with the traditional scale) and reducing the rate of cognitive function decline by more than 30% after intervention (compared with the non-intervention group). We will also open up some non-sensitive modules as SDK interfaces, so that they can be connected with other medical systems, so as to form a standardized technology platform</strong>. The platform is expected to pass medical device certification (such as national Class II medical devices), paving the way for subsequent large-scale deployment.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Application demonstration results:</strong> In terms of application, we strive to complete a certain range of demonstration applications within the project period. Firstly, a trial system was deployed in the geriatric cognitive impairment clinic of the cooperative hospital, and dozens of MCI/early AD patients were evaluated and trained to verify the effectiveness and safety of the system. The clinical data and case reports generated will be used as examples of project outcomes. Secondly, it will be piloted in the community elderly care service center to provide cognitive screening and home training services for the elderly in the community in the portable device + cloud platform model. It is expected to establish at least 2 community demonstration sites, covering the elderly population of 100 people, and explore a new model of integrating artificial awareness and cognitive intervention into grassroots public health. We will summarize the demonstration experience, formulate service processes and management specifications, and provide replicable templates for subsequent promotion. In addition, the application demonstration will also accumulate user feedback for us, which can be used to optimize the human-computer interaction and personalized functions of the system, so that the results are more closely related to the actual needs.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Standardization system output:</strong> In view of the cutting-edge nature of this project, we will actively participate in the formulation of relevant national/industry standards and upgrade the project results to standardization. With the support of the Professional Committee of Elderly Health Standards of the National Health Commission, we will promote the establishment of the industry standard project of \"Technical Requirements for Digital Assessment and Intervention System of Cognitive Function\", <strong>prepare draft standards and submit them for review. The content covers the performance indicators of multimodal evaluation equipment, data interface formats, and the interpretability requirements of AI algorithm results. We also plan to advocate with domestic experts to develop</strong> a \"Specification for the Evaluation of Artificial Awareness Medical System\" <strong>to provide a basis for the evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of similar systems. Through standardized output, it is ensured that the project results can be applied in a larger range in a standardized and safe manner, and lead the direction of industrial development.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>5. Industrialization Promotion Plan:</strong> After the completion of the project, we will accelerate the industrialization under the industry-university-research cooperation mechanism. Relying on the policy of Hainan Free Trade Port, it is planned to establish a high-tech start-up company or cooperate with existing medical AI companies to focus on the productization and market development of this project. The 114 related authorized patents and new patents in this project will be used as the company's core intellectual property rights. In the short term, the company will refine the prototype system and create commercial versions of the product, including both medical and home versions. The medical version is aimed at hospitals and rehabilitation centers, and the key function is to assist doctors in screening and diagnosing and formulating rehabilitation plans; The Home Edition is aimed at community and individual users, emphasizing ease of use and recreation. We will actively apply for medical device registration, and it is expected that it will take 1-2 years to complete the registration approval and obtain legal sales qualifications. Then, through the demonstration in the tertiary hospitals, it will be expanded to the national geriatric hospitals, and at the same time, it will strive to enter the appropriate technology directory of primary health institutions. In terms of marketing, we will seek the support of insurance institutions and the government to purchase services, and include the system in the scope of chronic disease management to reduce the burden on individuals. It is expected that within 3-5 years, the large-scale application of the product can be realized, serving millions of elderly families, and bringing good social and economic benefits to the enterprise.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Smart healthcare integration and long-term vision:</strong> In the long run, the results of this project can be integrated as an important part of the smart healthcare system. We will connect with the regional national health information platform to connect the system and electronic health record data to achieve more comprehensive health management for the elderly. For example, the results of cognitive assessment can be uploaded to the health record for the doctor's reference. Or combine wearable device data to realize the linkage monitoring of cognition and physical health. This will promote the integration of cognitive health into the overall framework of smart healthcare. At the same time, we plan to build a cloud-based artificial awareness cognitive service platform, so that grassroots health centers and nursing homes can obtain professional cognitive assessment and training solutions without the need for complex equipment, and only call our AI services through the cloud platform, so as to improve the ability of grassroots services and promote health equity. Looking forward to the future, if the artificial consciousness system is successful in AD intervention, its model can also be extended to other chronic disease management, such as Parkinson's rehabilitation, depression psychological intervention, etc., to achieve a set of artificial consciousness system, a pattern applicable to multiple scenarios. It can be seen that this project is not only a special research on AD, but also a cutting-edge exploration of artificial intelligence-enabled medical care, and the concepts and technologies formed will inject new vitality and direction into smart medical care and smart elderly care.</p>\n<p>In summary, this project is expected to produce fruitful research results, which will not only enable the publication of high-level papers, obtain independent intellectual property rights, but also create a practical application of artificial consciousness cognitive intervention system. Driven by national policies and market demand, these achievements will be rapidly transformed and implemented through standardization and industrialization, bringing tangible benefits to Alzheimer's disease patients and the elderly, and at the same time promoting the innovation and development of China's artificial intelligence and medical device industry, which has great social significance and economic value. We are confident and capable of successfully completing various tasks within the project cycle and delivering an excellent answer sheet for the national key R&amp;D plan.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

Based on the DIKWP model (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom-Purpose) and artificial consciousness theory proposed by Professor Duan Yucong, the project integrates neurobiology, multi-omics, big data analysis and social psychology methods to explore the multi-scale mechanisms of mental disorders from the cellular and molecular level to the information processing and consciousness level. The main research contents include: drawing disease-specific cell maps and neural circuit structures in brain regions, and deducing the mechanism of lesion regional information processing defects and consciousness disturbance based on the DIKWP model; Elucidate the abnormal pathogenic pathways of mental disorders, and use the evidence of effective clinical drugs to reversely verify the relationship between the etiological mechanism of the disease and the hypothesis of \"information control failure\" in artificial consciousness. To explore the objective biomarkers of early diagnosis of mental disorders, and to establish a prediction index system based on the three-level pathway of cognition-information-structure. To study the role of social stress and psychological intervention in the occurrence and development of diseases, and to explore the linkage mechanism between social stress and the \"environmental mapping layer\" in the evolution of artificial consciousness. and exploring a new comprehensive treatment model that combines pharmacotherapy with psychosocial interventions. The project will be designed in accordance with the specifications of national scientific research projects, and adopt multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary technical routes and innovative methods. The expected outputs include revealing the key pathogenic circuits and abnormal patterns of information processing in mental disorders, proposing new etiological hypotheses and diagnostic indicators from the perspective of artificial consciousness, and developing new models and intervention strategies for comprehensive treatment. The results of this study will help deepen the understanding of the nature of mental disorders, promote more effective early diagnosis and individualized treatment plans, and provide a scientific basis for improving the prognosis and quality of life of patients.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Basis-for-the-project\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Basis-for-the-project\" title=\"Basis for the project\"></a><strong>Basis for the project</strong></h1><h2 id=\"1-Current-status-and-research-challenges-of-mental-disorders\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#1-Current-status-and-research-challenges-of-mental-disorders\" title=\"1. Current status and research challenges of mental disorders\"></a><strong>1. Current status and research challenges of mental disorders</strong></h2><p>Depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia are major mental disorders with high prevalence and disability worldwide. Depression alone is estimated by the World Health Organization to affect about 280 million people and is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, bipolar disorder affected about 40 million people in 2019, and schizophrenia affects about 24 million people. These diseases usually occur in young adults and have the characteristics of prolonged recurrence, which brings a heavy burden to the patient's family and society. Although there are some pharmacological and psychotherapeutic approaches for these disorders, the efficacy is limited, and many patients struggle to achieve complete remission or recovery. As an example, about one-third of patients with depression do not respond significantly to initial antidepressant therapy, and the recurrence rate of treatment-resistant depression is as high as 75%. Patients with bipolar disorder have a poor long-term prognosis and significant functional impairment; The life expectancy of patients with schizophrenia is shortened by 10-20 years compared with ordinary people, which seriously affects the quality of life. Obviously, the <strong>existing treatment methods cannot fully solve the global public health problem of mental disorders</strong>, and it is urgent to deepen the understanding of disease mechanisms through basic research, so as to develop new diagnosis and treatment strategies.</p>\n<p>For a long time, the pathogenic mechanism of mental disorders has been thought to involve the interaction of complex biological, psychological, and social factors. At present, the academic community still has insufficient understanding of these diseases, and there are many key scientific questions to be answered. For example: Do different mental disorders have a common neurobiological basis? Why do these disorders cause abnormalities in cognitive function and mental status? What specific areas of the brain, cell types, and circuits are affected in disease? How does environmental stress induce or exacerbate the disease biologically? Research on these issues is not only of great scientific importance, but also a basis for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. However, due to the high complexity of the human brain and the high diversity of psychiatric disorders, it has been difficult to fully unravel the cross-level mechanisms from cellular molecules to system behavior. In recent years, with the rapid development of neuroscience and omics technology, we have the opportunity to deeply characterize the disease brain at the single-cell and circuit level, bringing revolutionary breakthroughs to the study of mental disorders.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-The-development-of-multi-scale-brain-science-and-technology-provides-new-opportunities-for-mechanistic-research\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-The-development-of-multi-scale-brain-science-and-technology-provides-new-opportunities-for-mechanistic-research\" title=\"2. The development of multi-scale brain science and technology provides new opportunities for mechanistic research\"></a><strong>2. The development of multi-scale brain science and technology provides new opportunities for mechanistic research</strong></h2><p><strong>Cell mapping and circuit elucidation in brain regions</strong>: With the help of single-cell transcriptome sequencing, large-scale brain tissue imaging, and connectome mapping, researchers have begun to construct cell types and circuit connectivity maps of the human brain. This lays the foundation for understanding the microscopic changes in the brain in psychiatric disorders. Recently, a large study analyzed more than a million human brain cells, mapped the distribution of 107 cell subtypes in 42 brain regions, and associated specific cell types with diseases such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. For example, Nature Neuroscience published results that show that risk genes for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression are enriched in specific neuronal populations, such as somatic inhibitory interneurons (<strong>SST-positive cells),</strong> <strong>excitatory neurons in the posterior cingulate cortex, and medium-sized spinous projection neurons in the amygdala. This suggests that there may be different \"clusters of diseased cells\" and \"abnormal circuit nodes\" in the brain in different diseases. At the same time, at the brain network level, functional magnetic resonance imaging</strong> (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) studies have revealed that patients with mental disorders often have abnormal brain functional network connectivity. For example, in patients with schizophrenia, the Default Mode Network (DMN) has both weakened and increased connections to other brain networks, and this disconnection may be an important cause of symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and confusion. Patients with depression often present with hyperactivity of DMN (associated with introverted contemplation) and a low cognitive control network, resulting in negative emotional rumination and attentional bias towards negative information. <strong>These findings suggest that advanced multi-scale brain science and technology can be used to deeply characterize cell-circuit-network abnormalities related to mental illness, which lays a research foundation for this project.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Abnormal information processing and alteration of consciousness</strong>: Mental disorders are not only anatomical and biochemical changes in the brain, but also manifest as abnormalities in information processing function and state of consciousness. For example, patients often have cognitive symptoms such as inability to concentrate, oversensitivity or sluggishness, impaired thinking and association, and impaired control of volitional behavior. A growing body of research has identified these as defects in the brain's information processing process. Some scholars have proposed that schizophrenia can be regarded as a \"consciousness disorder\", partly due to the disconnection between unconscious information processing and conscious cognition, which makes it difficult for patients to filter sensory input and automatically process daily information, and has to make up for it with conscious efforts, resulting in abnormal experiences. Experimental evidence shows that patients with schizophrenia have early sensory gating disorder and attentional filtering deficits, and are unable to inhibit irrelevant stimuli, resulting in perceptual overload and cognitive fragmentation. Similarly, patients with major depressive disorder exhibit an attentional bias and cognitive rigidity towards negative emotional information, which can be seen as the brain's inability to properly screen and control the flow of information—positive information is not effectively transmitted to high-level cognition, and negative information is over-amplified. In the manic episode stage of bipolar disorder, it is common to have rushing thoughts, excessive motivation, and weakened impulse control, which can be understood as an imbalance in the regulation of information and motivation at the higher control level. These phenomena coincide with the \"information control failure\" hypothesis: that is, the occurrence of mental disorders is likely to stem from the dysfunction of the brain's key information processing/control circuits, resulting in deviations or loss of control of the cognitive system's filtering, integration, and interpretation of internal and external information. This project intends to use this as a starting point to characterize the manifestation of this information flow disorder in diseases with the help of the consciousness model in artificial intelligence, and to answer the mechanism why the failure of information control can lead to consciousness and behavior abnormalities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-A-new-theoretical-perspective-introduced-by-the-DIKWP-artificial-consciousness-model\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-A-new-theoretical-perspective-introduced-by-the-DIKWP-artificial-consciousness-model\" title=\"3. A new theoretical perspective introduced by the DIKWP artificial consciousness model\"></a><strong>3. A new theoretical perspective introduced by the DIKWP artificial consciousness model</strong></h2><p>Traditional research mostly focuses on biology or psychology, and the understanding of mental disorders is relatively fragmented. <strong>This project innovatively introduces Professor Duan Yucong's DIKWP artificial consciousness theoretical framework</strong> to provide a holistic cognitive perspective that integrates data-information-knowledge-wisdom-purpose for the study of mental disorders. The DIKWP model is based on the classic DIKW (pyramid) model, which adds a \"Purpose\" layer, which is composed of five levels: data→ information→ knowledge→ Wisdom → Purpose. This model emphasizes the guiding and constraining role of the highest level of purpose on the cognitive processing of the lower level, and realizes the dynamic regulation and self-renewal of the cognitive process through two-way feedback between the levels. The research of Professor Duan Yucong's team shows that the DIKWP model provides an interpretable and controllable cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence systems, and has made breakthroughs in artificial consciousness evaluation by embedding the \"Purpose\" layer to achieve the alignment of machine decision-making to the goal. More importantly, the model attempts to simulate the process of human consciousness formation, so that AI has human-like self-monitoring and reflection capabilities. This provides a new way to re-examine mental disorders from the perspective of information science and systems theory: <strong>perhaps mental illness can be seen as a dysfunctional manifestation of the DIKWP architecture in the biological brain</strong>- That is, there are bugs (defects) in information processing at different levels or an imbalance in feedback between levels, resulting in exceptions at the Wisdom decision-making and Purpose level. This project will use the DIKWP model as a theoretical tool to systematically analyze the possible problems in the brain of patients with mental disorders in data acquisition, information integration, knowledge refinement, wisdom decision-making and purpose control. For example, is the data layer of the sensory input already noise-filtering? Is the processing of perception signals distorted at the information level? Does the knowledge layer (the brain's intrinsic model) form false causal inferences (such as delusions)? Are the decision-making functions of the Wisdom layer (e.g., situational judgment and value evaluation) impaired? And is the highest level of purpose (motivation/self-will) unable to effectively guide the lower levels, causing the patient to lose control of his thoughts and actions? These are all scientific questions that need to be explored urgently.</p>\n<p>In addition, the DIKWP artificial consciousness framework proposes a \"subconscious + conscious dual cycle\" <strong>structure, that is, in addition to the basic cognitive process, a metacognitive cycle is also introduced to achieve self-monitoring and regulation. This is similar to the human brain's conscious and subconscious feeding mechanism. Duan Yucong's team also proposed the \"BUG\" theory of consciousness, arguing that a moderate amount of randomness and imperfection should be allowed in artificial consciousness to simulate the creativity and robustness of human thinking. By analogy to mental illness, we can reflect: Is it possible that the \"bugs\" of the human brain, the tiny errors in the processing of information caused by certain genes or developments, may be accumulated and amplified into psychopathological phenomena? Some hypotheses suggest that people with schizophrenia have an elevated level of intrinsic noise in brain signals, leading to erroneous correlations being processed by the brain as really important information (i.e., abnormal \"salient conferencing\"). The</strong> \"deviant significance\" hypothesis proposed by Kapur et al. refers to the fact that the striatal dopamine dysfunction causes irrelevant stimuli to be given excessive meaning and triggers delusional hallucinations. This view is also essentially a manifestation of the failure of information control. In depression, the brain may have insufficient saliency to positive stimuli, and be overly sensitive to negative implicit information, resulting in negative cognitive paranoia. Different phases of bipolar disorder may oscillate between the two extremes of the saliency evaluation mechanism. This project will combine the DIKWP model and artificial consciousness theory to systematically demonstrate and verify the above conjectures. Through this interdisciplinary theoretical fusion, we hope to provide a full-link mechanistic explanatory framework for mental disorders**, connecting molecular, cellular, and circuit-level pathologies with information processing, cognitive function, and subjective conscious experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-The-new-need-for-accurate-diagnosis-and-comprehensive-intervention\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-The-new-need-for-accurate-diagnosis-and-comprehensive-intervention\" title=\"4. The new need for accurate diagnosis and comprehensive intervention\"></a><strong>4. The new need for accurate diagnosis and comprehensive intervention</strong></h2><p>Timely and accurate early diagnosis and scientific comprehensive treatment are the keys to improving the prognosis of mental disorders. In reality, however, there are significant deficiencies in both of these aspects. At present, clinical diagnosis is mainly based on subjective assessment of symptomatology, and there is a lack of objective biomarkers. Underlying changes in the brain may have occurred over a long period of time before the patient develops noticeable symptoms. Early markers that predict a high risk of disease can be identified to significantly advance the window of intervention. Studies have explored the combination of multimodal biomarkers, such as cognitive testing + brain imaging + genetic information, to improve the accuracy of predicting the occurrence of mental illness. A study in people at high risk of psychosis showed that machine learning using multimodal brain signal fusions such as structural MRI, functional connectivity, and diffusion tensor imaging could predict whether an individual would transition from high risk to schizophrenia episodes more accurately than a single modality (multimodal model AUC=0.73, significantly better than any unimodal AUC~0.66). This shows that the three-level path prediction method of \"cognition-information-structure\" is feasible and superior. Focusing on this idea, this project plans to systematically explore the early warning indicators of mental disorders: at the cognitive level, quantify the decline of small memory, attention, social cognition and other functions; At the information level, <strong>neuroelectrophysiological signals such as EEG/P300 and objective data such as eye movement and physiological sensing were used to capture abnormal patterns of information processing. At the structural level, brain imaging, biomarkers (e.g., inflammatory factors, hormone levels), and genetic/epigenetic markers are incorporated. Through machine learning and semantic network analysis, these different levels of information are fused to build predictive models and evaluate their sensitivity and specificity. We are particularly interested in</strong> the association between cognitive-information-structure pathways: for example, does the brain image of an individual with mild cognitive deficit and abnormal levels of stress hormone already show altered connectivity to specific networks? Can these changes predict future disease progression? Through in-depth research, we hope to find an objective and actionable combination of early diagnostic markers** to inform clinical screening and intervention.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>psychosocial factors play an important role in the occurrence and prognosis of mental disorders, which cannot be ignored. Studies have shown that experiences such as childhood trauma and chronic social stress can have a profound impact on the brain through epigenetics and other pathways, making individuals more susceptible to depression, anxiety, and psychotic disorders in adulthood. Longitudinal cohort studies have shown that people who have suffered multiple forms of childhood abuse have a significantly higher risk of depression in adulthood, and tend to have an earlier onset, a more chronic course of the disease, and a worse response to treatment. Social isolation, discrimination, and the stress of urbanizing life are associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia: the risk of developing schizophrenia is about 2.7 times higher in first-generation immigrants than in the local population, and up to 4.5 times higher in second-generation migrants, which is thought to be related to the social exclusion and stress experienced by immigrants. It can be seen that environmental stress profoundly affects mental health through various mechanisms such as chronic activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, induction of neuroinflammation, and shaping cognitive beliefs. This project will delve into the mechanisms by which social stress affects the brain and consciousness. On the one hand, at the animal level, we will use the chronic stress model and the mouse social frustration model to simulate the effects of environmental stress on neural circuitry and gene expression in the brain, and observe whether there are behavioral and neurobiological changes similar to human mental disorders. On the other hand, in clinical studies, we will combine epidemiological and neuroimaging data to analyze whether there are specific changes in brain structure and function, such as a decrease in hippocampal volume (a classic effect of chronic stress) and the amygdala, in people who have experienced high-pressure life events</strong>- Dysfunction of functional connectivity of the prefrontal lobes, etc. In addition, we plan to explore the mechanisms of action of psychological interventions in reversing or buffering these alterations. Evidence has shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction training can alter the pattern of brain functional activity, such as reducing the overconnection of the default network in patients with depression and enhancing the activity of the cognitive control network, thereby reducing symptoms. Family intervention and social skills training can reduce the relapse rate in schizophrenia, and their effect is partly attributed to improving patients' ability to cope with environmental stress and cognitive restructuring.</p>\n<p>We will introduce the concept of \"environmental mapping layer\" in artificial consciousness theory**, that is, the consciousness system needs to effectively model and map the external environmental information in order to produce adaptive cognitive responses. In AI, this means that AI needs to map perceived environmental states to internal semantic representations so that it can adjust its actions accordingly. In the same way, the human brain continues to construct internal representations of the social environment in which it lives, and responds cognitively and emotionally based on these representations. If the environment mapping is skewed, such as mistaking a safe environment for a threatened environment, it can lead to a persistent stress response and pathological psychology. This project hypothesizes that long-term social stress will cause the \"inner world model\" to deviate from reality by interfering with the brain's environmental mapping representation, thereby triggering symptoms such as anxiety and paranoia. Effective psychological interventions are equivalent to recalibrating the brain's environmental mapping, so that patients have a more accurate and adaptive conscious response to external stimuli. This hypothesis will be tested in our study by longitudinal follow-up and intervention experiments. The ultimate goal of the project is to combine drug treatment with psychological intervention**** and implement integrated treatment for bio-information-social factors, in order to achieve better outcomes and prognosis than treatment alone.</p>\n<p>In summary, the scientific basis for the establishment of this project is that <strong>the occurrence of mental disorders is the result of the joint action of multi-level pathological changes</strong>It needs to be comprehensively analyzed by new theoretical frameworks and research methods. The DIKWP artificial consciousness model provides us with a theoretical perspective that runs through data to purpose, and can link neurobiological mechanisms to cognitive function and consciousness phenomena. Modern multi-omics and brain imaging techniques have made it possible to conduct cross-scale research. On this basis, we will hopefully answer a series of major scientific questions in the field of mental disorders and bring breakthrough ideas for improving diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, the development of this project has important scientific significance and potential social benefits.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Research-Objectives\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-Objectives\" title=\"Research Objectives:\"></a><strong>Research Objectives:</strong></h1><p>The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the key links related to information processing and awareness in the pathogenesis of common mental disorders such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, and to explore innovative diagnostic markers and treatment strategies accordingly. Specific objectives include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Characterizing disease-specific cell maps and circuit structure abnormalities in brain regions</strong>: Using single-cell sequencing and brain imaging techniques, we can map the distribution of cell types and neural circuit connections in brain regions associated with depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia, and identify disease-specific \"foci\" cell populations and abnormal brain networks. At the same time, the DIKWP model was used to analyze the information processing function of these brain regions in normal cognition, and the mechanism of information flow obstruction or distortion in disease states was inferred.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>To analyze the abnormal pathogenic mechanism of mental disorders and verify the hypothesis of \"information control failure\"</strong>: to explore how the abnormalities of these pathways lead to cognitive and conscious dysfunction by targeting the typical biological pathways in three diseases (such as the monoamine and neurotrophic mechanisms of depression, the GSK-3 signaling pathway of bipolar disorder, and the dopamine-glutamate imbalance of schizophrenia), combined with the targets of clinically effective drugs (such as SSRIs, lithium salts, and antipsychotics). Using the evidence of drug reversal abnormalities, the role of the failure of key information control links in the brain in the etiology of diseases was verified. For example, do SSRIs increase 5-HT levels to alleviate depression by restoring normal processing of emotional information? Does lithium salt enhance cognitive regulation by inhibiting GSK-3β to promote neuroplasticity? Whether antipsychotic blockade of dopamine D2 receptor reduction delusions confirms correction of excessive \"salient\" markers.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Exploring biomarkers for early diagnosis of mental disorders</strong>: Establish a three-level index system of \"cognition-information-structure\" to screen the combination of objective markers that can predict the high-risk state or early prognosis of the disease. Focus on: mild patterns of cognitive impairment, changes in brain network functional connectivity (e.g., dysregulation of the default network and task-positive network), minor abnormalities in brain structure (e.g., subtle changes in cortical thickness or hippocampal volume), and levels of key proteins or metabolites (e.g., stress hormones, inflammatory factors). Apply multimodal data fusion and machine learning to develop predictive models and evaluate their usefulness. The goal is to find sensitive and reliable indicators for early warning and graded diagnosis of disease.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Elucidate the mechanism of social stress and psychological interventions</strong>: Through a combination of animal and clinical studies, we will reveal how chronic stress induces or aggravates mental disorders through neuroendocrine, immune, and neural circuit shaping pathways. Based on the theory of \"environmental mapping layer\" of artificial consciousness, this paper analyzes the impact of long-term stress on the internal environment model of the brain, and how effective psychological intervention can reshape this model to make it more adaptable to reality. Specific objectives include: verifying epigenetic alterations and changes in brain structure/function caused by stressors such as childhood adversity; To observe the modification of brain functional connectivity and cognitive patterns by psychological interventions (e.g., CBT, family therapy), and the correspondence between such changes and symptom improvement; To explore the protective mechanism of social support for disease prognosis.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Exploring innovative treatment models combining drugs and psychological</strong> interventions: designing and evaluating bio-psychological integrated treatment programs based on mechanistic studies。 To assess the effects of antidepressants combined with cognitive behavioural therapy to improve cognitive biases and prevent relapse for depression; For bipolar disorder, the effect of mood stabilizers combined with family psychoeducation in prolonging remission was evaluated; To assess the effects of antipsychotics combined with social functioning training/vocational rehabilitation on improving functional outcomes for schizophrenia. This paper summarizes the synergistic mechanism and applicable population of each combination of therapies, and forms a comprehensive intervention model that can be promoted to provide a basis for clinical practice. The goal is to demonstrate that combination therapies are more effective than monotherapy in improving efficacy and adherence, and to elucidate the synergistic mechanisms behind them (e.g., the dual role of pharmacological improvement of biological abnormalities + psychological intervention to correct cognitive distortion).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By achieving the above goals, this project will comprehensively reveal the cross-scale mechanisms of mental disorders from microscopic cells to macroscopic behaviors, validate new etiological and treatment hypotheses, and lay a scientific foundation for the future development of objective diagnostic tools and comprehensive treatment options.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Research-content-and-technical-route\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-content-and-technical-route\" title=\"Research content and technical route\"></a><strong>Research content and technical route</strong></h1><p>Focusing on the research objectives, the project sets up five major research contents (topics), and formulates corresponding technical routes and research plans for each part. Each part not only carries out in-depth research relatively independently, but also closely connects through the theoretical framework of DIKWP to form an overall interpretation of the pathogenic mechanism of mental disorders. The specific plans and technical roadmaps for each research content are described in the following order.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Research-content-1-Characterization-of-cell-maps-and-circuit-structures-in-disease-specific-brain-regions\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-content-1-Characterization-of-cell-maps-and-circuit-structures-in-disease-specific-brain-regions\" title=\"Research content 1: Characterization of cell maps and circuit structures in disease-specific brain regions\"></a><strong>Research content 1: Characterization of cell maps and circuit structures in disease-specific brain regions</strong></h2><p><strong>Main scientific question:</strong> What regions and cell types in the brain of people with mental disorders have specific changes? How do these changes affect the brain's information processing processes and disrupt the state of consciousness?</p>\n<p><strong>Research Protocol:</strong> This content will use single-cell omics and brain imaging techniques to provide an in-depth analysis of the brain of depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia at the cell-circuit level. The subjects of the study included autopsy brain tissue of patients, living brain tissue samples obtained by craniotomy (e.g., those with depression in epilepsy surgical resection specimens of drug-resistant patients), and multimodal brain imaging data of living patients. The specific steps are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) mapping: Select</strong> key brain regions that are closely related to each disease to sample and isolate cells (e.g., prefrontal cortex and hippocampus for depression, nucleus accumbens and amygdala for bipolar disorder, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus for schizophrenia, etc.). RNA sequencing of individual cells yields gene expression profiles from hundreds of thousands or even millions of cells. Bioinformatics clustering classified different cell types and subtypes, and compared the differences in the number of cells and gene expression between patients and healthy controls. The expected outcome is to identify disease-related cellular abnormalities, such as a significant decrease in the number or abnormal gene expression of certain inhibitory interneurons, and an increase in glial activation. Combined with existing studies, we pay special attention to the previously mentioned cells that have a role in a variety of diseases, such as SST-positive inhibitory interneurons, excitatory projection neurons, and dopaminergic neurons. If sequencing results also show abnormalities in these cells (e.g., clusters of excitatory neurons in the amygdala of bipolar and schizophrenia patients rich in disease-risk genes), their functional significance will be investigated in depth.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Spatial transcriptome and immunohistochemistry validation:</strong> In order to understand the spatial distribution of cell abnormalities and the corresponding anatomical circuits, spatial transcriptome sequencing or high-throughput in situ hybridization can be used to determine the gene expression distribution while maintaining the tissue structure in the above-mentioned brain regions, so as to map the anatomical map of cell abnormalities. At the same time, multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry/in situ hybridization was applied to validate the localization of key discovered cell types. For example, if scRNA-seq shows a decrease in cingulate gyrus lamellar SST cells in patients with schizophrenia, we will confirm the density change of SST+ neurons at that level by counting SST+ neurons by immunostaining. Combined with high-resolution microscopy and tissue clearing technology, the local loop structure can be reconstructed in 3D to observe potential differences in synaptic connections between disease and control (e.g., dendritic spine density, excitability/inhibition synaptic ratio, etc.).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Whole brain neuroimaging connectome analysis:</strong> For brain regions and circuits that are found to be abnormal at the single-cell level, we will verify their macroscopic impact in living patients using imaging methods such as MRI/DTI/fMRI. These include:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Structural MRI and DTI: Measure</strong> gray matter volume, cortical thickness, and integrity of associated white matter fiber bundles in target brain regions. If single-cell results suggest neuronal impairment of the prefrontal-hippocampal circuit in patients with depression, we expect that a thinning of the prefrontal cortex, a decrease in hippocampal volume, and a decrease in the white matter tract anisotropy of the prefrontal-hippocampal line may be observed on structural images.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Functional MRI (resting and tasking): focuses</strong> on the strength of the connections of the functional network in which the target brain region is located. For example, the anterior cingulate - default network, parietal lobe - note if the network is too strong or too weak in the patient. Based on our preliminary hypothesis, abnormal DMN sub-network connectivity in patients with schizophrenia may be associated with hallucinatory delusions; In patients with depression, DMN is inversely correlated with cognitive control network, weakened, and related to contemplation. These imaging indicators were correlated with the patient's cognitive phenotype (neuropsychological test results) and symptom severity to establish a cell-circuit-function link.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>EEG/Magnetic Encephalography (MEG): Captures</strong> the dynamics of information processing in abnormal brain regions in the temporal dimension. For example, when sensory gating is assessed with EEG ERP components (P300, MMN, etc.), a decrease in P300 amplitude in people at high risk of schizophrenia is considered to be one of the signals before the onset of positive symptoms. This project will test whether these biomarkers are associated with the specific brain region/cell abnormalities we find, such as whether the alteration of P300 is due to the abnormal synchronization of neuronal activity in a specific brain region.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <strong>Inferring information processing deficiencies in combination with the DIKWP model:</strong> Based on the acquisition of disease-related cell and circuit abnormalities, we will use the DIKWP model to explain these brain changes at the functional level. This is done by mapping brain regions and their connections to different levels of DIKWP functions. For example, the sensory cortex corresponds to the \"data\" layer and is responsible for raw signal acquisition; The hippocampus and associated thalamic nuclei correspond to the \"information\" layer, which is responsible for memory and contextual information integration. The prefrontal cortex can correspond to the \"Wisdom\" layer, which is responsible for rule extraction, decision-making, and value judgment. The parietal-prefrontal attention network can be regarded as an information selection mechanism under the regulation of the \"Wisdom\" layer. The self-correlation processing of the default network and the motivation evaluation of the limbic system are related to the \"Purpose\" layer. With the help of this correspondence, we can deduce the problems that arise at each level of the disease state: for example, if there is a filtration disorder in the information layer (thalamic-sensory cortex circuit) in schizophrenia, then a large amount of irrelevant data will pour into the knowledge layer, resulting in a bias in the model construction (understanding of reality) in the knowledge layer, and it will be difficult for the wisdom layer to make correct judgments based on this, and finally the high-level goals (such as self-concept) in the purpose layer may also be confused. This deduction will be combined with computational modeling: we plan to build a simplified DIKWP computational model to simulate the flow of information in both normal and disease states. By artificially introducing specific circuit defects (such as reducing inhibition feedback, increasing noisy signals, etc.) into the model, and observing the changes in the model's output (such as knowledge reasoning error rate, purpose target bias), we can verify whether a certain type of brain circuit abnormality is enough to cause similar psychiatric symptoms. This computational simulation can be implemented either in a computer (with the DIKWP concept incorporated into the artificial neural network architecture) or with the help of a dynamic causal model (DCM) to verify the change in the direction of information flow on the fMRI data.</p>\n<p><strong>Technology Roadmap:</strong> <em>The technical path of research content 1 integrates four stages: \"tissue sample processing</em> &gt; single-cell/spatial omics, &gt; image validation, &gt; theoretical model analysis\". We will first obtain brain tissue samples (ethically, obtained from brain banks and surgical procedures), perform single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptome experiments, and find cellular and molecular abnormalities; Histology was then used to verify the authenticity and localization of the cell abnormality. In parallel, MRI/EEG examinations were performed on supporting clinical subjects, and imaging and electrophysiological features were extracted to corroborate with histological results. Finally, in the stage of theoretical modeling, the empirical findings are integrated into the cognitive model of the DIKWP framework for deductive simulation, and the theoretical explanation of the disease information processing disorder is proposed. Such multiple layers of validation ensure consistency from micro to macro and map biological abnormalities to cognitive deficits, providing a basis for subsequent research.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Research-content-2-Analysis-of-abnormal-pathogenic-mechanism-and-verification-of-the-hypothesis-of-information-control-failure\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-content-2-Analysis-of-abnormal-pathogenic-mechanism-and-verification-of-the-hypothesis-of-information-control-failure\" title='Research content 2: Analysis of abnormal pathogenic mechanism and verification of the hypothesis of \"information control failure\".'></a><strong>Research content 2: Analysis of abnormal pathogenic mechanism and verification of the hypothesis of \"information control failure\".</strong></h2><p><strong>Main scientific question:</strong> What are the core pathophysiology of mental disorders? How can abnormalities in molecular pathways be correlated with impairment of cognitive/conscious function? Can the mechanism of action of clinically effective drugs reflect the causal mechanism of the disease, so as to verify the hypothesis of \"information control failure\"?</p>\n<p><strong>Research Protocol:</strong> This section will focus on the known important biological mechanisms of depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, and delve into how their abnormalities affect neurological information processing. At the same time, the hypothesis was reversely tested through drug intervention experiments: if the symptoms can be alleviated by correcting the abnormality of a certain link, it means that the abnormality of the link may be the key to pathogenesis. The specific plan is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Mechanism analysis of depression:</strong> Focusing on the two classic hypotheses of monoamine neurotransmitter imbalance and neurotrophic disorder. The levels of serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine, dopamine and their metabolites were detected in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples, and the possession of 5-HT transporters and receptors in the brain of depressed patients was evaluated by PET imaging, and the degree of monoamine signal disorder was confirmed. Simultaneous analysis of peripheral inflammatory factors (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels was performed to verify whether depression was accompanied by chronic inflammation and decreased BDNF. Animal model experiments (a mouse model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable stress) were then conducted to observe how stress led to changes in monoamines and BDNF, as well as consequent behavioral abnormalities and neuroplastic alterations (e.g., reduction in dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons). <strong>Hypothesis validation of information control failure</strong>: an antidepressant intervention model animal and patient to test its effect on information processing and neuroplasticity. For example, can a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) restore dendritic spine density and cognitive flexibility in hippocampal neurons in model mice? Studies have shown that chronic stress leads to a decrease in the synaptic ridge and impaired neuroplasticity, and rapid antidepressants such as ketamine can reverse synaptic function and increase BDNF levels within 24 hours, thereby rapidly improving symptoms. We will replicate this phenomenon in the model and further explore: Does ketamine's increased BDNF-TrkB signaling and induced synaptic enhancement correspond to the recovery of processing capacity in the knowledge/wisdom layer (e.g., improved performance of animals on cognitive tasks) in the DIKWP model? If the answer is positive, the core cause of depression is a decline in the plasticity of the brain's information processing network, and a sluggish control of information, which is corrected by drugs that increase plasticity (increase the efficiency of \"data-information\" conversion).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Mechanism analysis of bipolar disorder: focusing</strong> on intracellular signal transduction and neuroplastic rhythm abnormalities. Bipolar disorder is unique in that the patient's neurobiological status fluctuates between the depressive and manic poles, suggesting a possible failure of the \"timing control\" mechanism that regulates homeostasis. We will investigate the role of GSK-3β signaling pathway and circadian genes in bipolar disorder. There is extensive evidence that lithium is the preferred mood stabilizer and exerts efficacy by inhibiting GSK-3β activity. GSK-3β is involved in multiple downstream pathways (Wnt/β-catenin, release of brain-derived factors, etc.) and is associated with cell survival and neurogenesis. We will measure GSK-3β activity and Wnt signaling in peripheral cells and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons to see if patients with bipolar disorder have congenital abnormalities or hyperactivity of this pathway. At the same time, the expression pattern of circadian genes (such as CLOCK, BMAL1) and melatonin secretion rhythm were monitored to evaluate whether the circadian rhythm was disordered. <strong>Hypothesis verification:</strong> Lithium salt/other mood stabilizer intervention experiments were designed to observe whether lithium salt could correct abnormal animal behavior and restore synaptic plasticity indicators such as long-term enhancement (LTP) in biphasic animal models (such as CLOCK mutant mice or mouse models acutely given manic drugs). On the other hand, lithium salts or GSK-3 inhibitors were added to in vitro iPSC neuronal models to detect changes in neuronal growth and synaptic formation, as well as correction of gene expression. If lithium treatment does promote increased expression of neuronal dendritic branching and synaptic markers, improving cellular adaptability to periodic depolarizing stimuli, it is demonstrated that bipolar disorder may stem from deficiencies in neuronal plasticity and rhythm regulation, and that drugs restore control of the excitator/inhibition balance by stabilizing intracellular information pathways (reducing noise fluctuations). We will also explain the role of lithium salts in combination with the DIKWP model: lithium salts may be equivalent to strengthening the stable regulation of the \"knowledge layer\" on the lower level of information, so that brain decision-making no longer fluctuates excessively with random signals, and verifying this will deepen the understanding of biphasic pathology.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Mechanism analysis of schizophrenia: Focusing</strong> on the effects of neurotransmitter imbalances (especially dopamine and glutamate) on information processing and perception. The widely accepted hypothesis is that schizophrenia has an overactive dopamine function in the limbic pathway of the midbrain, resulting in the wrong assignment of stimuli to saliency; At the same time, it may be accompanied by insufficient function of cortical glutamate NMDA receptors, resulting in decreased cortical excitability and GABAergic interneuron regulation disorders. Both of these can be seen as malfunctions of information control: the former allows irrelevant information to break into higher consciousness (hallucinatory delusions), and the latter causes the brain's entire network to synchronously disintegrate (cognitive disintegration). We will verify this through the following experiments:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Dopamine function assay:</strong> Positron emission tomography (PET) tracer was used to detect the dopamine synthesis and release level of the striatum in patients to verify whether there was excess dopamine synthesis/release in patients with schizophrenia. Dopamine synthase DOPA decarboxylase activity was expected to increase in the striatum of patients compared with those who were naïve and healthy. If possible, the correlation of dopamine release with the patient's hallucinatory delusion score will be investigated.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>NMDA receptor function assessment:</strong> Combining preclinical studies and genetic data to analyze the gene expression and function of NMDA receptor subunits associated with schizophrenia. If available, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to measure the ratio of glutamate to GABA concentration in the prefrontal lobe, and transgenic mice (carrying schizophrenia risk genes such as NRG1 and DISC1 mutations) can be used to study the glutamate mechanism.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Animal pharmacological model:</strong> Mice were acutely administered phencyclidine (PCP) or MK-801 (NMDA receptor antagonist) to induce psychotic-like behaviors and record their deficits in tasks such as prepulse inhibition (PPI) and working memory. This is the classic NMDA low-function model. Tranquilizers (antipsychotics, such as chlorpromazine or newer D2 partial agonists) are then used to see if the behavioural deficit can be reversed. Focuses on recording changes in animal performance on perceptual filtering (PPI) and cognitive flexibility (e.g., mazes) to correspond to human information processing capabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Validation of the information control hypothesis:</strong> If the above model shows that blocking NMDA receptors causes information processing disorders similar to those of schizophrenia (eg, decreased PPI, indicating poor sensory screening), and D2 antagonists can partially restore PPI, then cortical excitability**/inhibition balance and dopamine modulation are essential for information gating**。 We will further analyze human brain imaging/EEG data to look for a correspondence between dopamine-glutamate imbalance and abnormal nerve signaling. For example, a decrease in EEG (Auditory Change Perception) is widely reported and can be considered an indicator of unconscious information processing deficits. We planned to measure the change in MMN before and after the first dose of antipsychotic medication in patients with the first episode. If D2 receptor blockade therapy increases the amplitude of MMN, it means that the treatment repairs the early sensory information processing capacity to a certain extent, supporting the hypothesis that dopamine excessively interferes with sensory information pathways. Combined with the previously mentioned deviant saliency view, we will formalize the mechanism in the DIKWP model: assuming that the Purpose layer lowers the threshold for assigning information to the lower layers, resulting in too much data being fed back to the higher levels as meaningful information, causing confusion. Simulations were used to verify whether the adjusted parameters could reproduce and correct the symptoms.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Technology Roadmap:</strong> <em>Research content 2 is carried out in three steps: \"mechanism-drug-validation\". Firstly, in-depth mechanism experiments were conducted on the key mechanisms of each disease selection (including biochemical detection, gene expression, animal models, etc.). Intervention drugs</em> (antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics) targeting this mechanism were then applied to the model or patients to observe changes in biological and behavioral indicators; Finally, the experimental results were included in the interpretation of the information processing framework of artificial consciousness to judge whether it conforms to the information control failure hypothesis. For example, if the experiment finds that dendritic damage + information processing delay in the depression model, and SSRI restores dendritic density + improves processing efficiency, then it can be considered that the core of depression is the weakening of the function of the information transmission link, and the drug can solve it by strengthening the data-to-information conversion rate; In the schizophrenic model, too much dopamine + PPI decreased, and the drug inhibited the rise of dopamine + PPI, indicating that excessive prominence signals led to filtration failure, and the drug rebuilt the filtration threshold. Through multi-target and multi-level experimental evidence, we will examine whether the etiology of mental disorders can be attributed to common defects in information control, and find out the similarities and differences between various diseases under this framework.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Research-content-3-Discovery-of-biomarkers-for-early-diagnosis-of-mental-disorders\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-content-3-Discovery-of-biomarkers-for-early-diagnosis-of-mental-disorders\" title=\"Research content 3: Discovery of biomarkers for early diagnosis of mental disorders\"></a><strong>Research content 3: Discovery of biomarkers for early diagnosis of mental disorders</strong></h2><p><strong>Main scientific question:</strong> Can objective indicators be used to predict the onset and progression of mental disorders before patients develop typical clinical symptoms? Which metrics or combinations of them are the most prospective and specific?</p>\n<p><strong>Research Protocol:</strong> In this part, we will carry out longitudinal cohort studies and multimodal biomarker mining to establish a three-level predictor system of \"cognition-information-structure\". The overall design is to recruit high-risk groups and early patients with mental disorders, combine follow-up and multimodal data collection, and apply machine learning to screen out reliable early diagnostic markers and verify their predictive efficacy. Specific implementation steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Cohort Recruitment and Placement:</strong> The following groups of people are recruited: (a) those with high familial genetic risk (e.g., adolescents with first-degree relatives with schizophrenia; First and second degree relatives of patients with bipolar disorder, etc.); (b) individuals with clinical high-risk syndrome (CHR), such as young people with mild psychotic symptoms but not yet onset, or patients at high risk of bipolar conversion from recurrent depressive episodes; (c) patients with the first onset of disease in the early stage (the course of the disease &lt; 1 year, without systemic treatment); and a matched healthy control population. Strive to include 100-200 people in each group, and follow up the high-risk group for 2-3 years to see whether it is transformed into a confirmed patient.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Multimodal Baseline Assessment:</strong> A comprehensive multimodal examination was performed on each subject at the time of enrollment, including:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Cognitive Assessment:</strong> Attention, working memory, executive function, emotion recognition, and more are tested using a standard neuropsychological battery. Particular attention is paid to possible patterns of minor impairments, such as mild working memory and social cognitive deficits in people at high risk of schizophrenia, and attention bias towards negative words in people at high risk of depression.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Information:</strong> Paradigms such as event-dependent potential (ERP) are used to measure unconscious and conscious information processing. Such as P50 auditory gating, MMN, P300, eye tracking (smooth pursuit), etc. These objective signals can quantify the efficiency of the brain's filtering and processing of stimuli. For example, individuals at high risk of schizophrenia often have decreased P50 inhibition or decreased P300 amplitude.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Structural and functional imaging of the brain (Structure):</strong> High-resolution structural MRI was performed to measure the volume and thickness of the brain region; DTI assesses white matter integrity; Resting-state fMRI assesses functional connectivity patterns. The imaging indicators related to various diseases reported in the literature were extracted, such as the decrease in hippocampal and amygdala volume in the early stage of depression, and the abnormal default network connection in patients at high risk of mental illness.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Other biomarkers:</strong> Blood samples were collected for genetic polygenic risk score calculation, inflammatory markers (IL-6, CRP, etc.) measurement, stress hormone (such as cortisol arousal response) assessment, etc. New digital behavioral markers, such as wearable devices that record objective data such as sleep rhythm and activity level, can also be considered.<br/>All of these data will constitute a \"biomarker signature set\" for each subject.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Follow-up and outcome determination:</strong> Psychiatric assessments were performed at regular intervals (every 6 months) in the high-risk group, such as SCID interviews to determine whether there was a mental disorder that had progressed to a definitive diagnosis, and changes in severity of symptom scales. Follow-up for 2 to 3 years was recorded, which high-risk individuals were converted to patients, as well as symptom progression and functional outcomes in the patient group.</p>\n<p>Biomarker <strong>Screening and Modeling:</strong> Statistical and machine learning methods are used to screen the combination of metrics that best predict outcomes from baseline multimodal features. Specific steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Univariate analysis: to compare the differences between transformers and non-transformers in each individual index, and preliminarily screen for differentiated candidate markers (such as significantly lower working memory scores, lower P300 amplitude, etc.).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Feature selection: LASSO regression, random forest and other methods are used to select the group of features that contribute the most to the prediction to avoid too much redundant information. We will pay special attention to <strong>the combination of features across the three layers of \"cognition-information-structure\",</strong> for example, a model may include three different levels of features of \"executive function test score + P50 inhibition rate + hippocampal volume\".</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Build a predictive model: Try a variety of machine learning models (logistic regression, support vector machines, neural networks, etc.) to cross-validate the trained model to predict the outcome (conversion or non-conversion) of high-risk individuals. The area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and other indicators were used to evaluate the performance of the model. A previously mentioned study of people at high risk of psychosis showed that the AUC of the multimodal fusion model was 0.73 better than that of the single-modality, and we strive to achieve or exceed this accuracy.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Validate the model: Apply the model to an independent validation sample (if available, collaborate with other centers to obtain independent high-risk cohort data) to verify robustness. If there are no independent samples, the stability of the model is verified by repeating different subsamples internally.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Model interpretation: Combined with the DIKWP model, the selected features were interpreted. For example, if the final model selects three characteristics: \"Accuracy of Emotion Recognition Test\", \"Amplitude of N400 ERP Component (Semantic Processing Potential)\" and \"Functional Connectivity Strength of Prefrontal-Limbic System\", it can be interpreted as follows: the emotion recognition ability of the cognitive layer, the language semantic processing efficiency of the information layer, and the affective network coupling of the structure/functional layer jointly determine whether the high-risk individual will develop the disease. This is consistent with the DIKWP's view that the abnormal accumulation of data/information processing eventually leads to the clinical symptoms of the collapse at the Wisdom/Purpose level. We will explore the relationship between these characteristics and the predicted output of the model, and understand how risk manifests itself through each layer.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <strong>Early warning system development:</strong> Development of easy-to-use assessment tools or scoring systems based on screened markers. For example, if a predictive model contains several key metrics, a weighted total score formula can be designed to assess individual risk. We will attempt to set thresholds in the follow-up data to optimize sensitivity and specificity to guide when to intervene clinically for high-risk individuals. Validation experiments are also planned for important biomarkers, such as validating intraday variability of specific EEG signals and testing test-retest reliability to assess their practical feasibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Technology Roadmap:</strong> <em>Study content 3 takes the route of \"cohort follow-up</em> + multimodal fusion\". The initial investment is in cohort recruitment and data collection, followed by data analysis modeling. The key point of the technology lies in the effective fusion and feature selection of multi-source data. With the help of advanced statistical learning tools, such as multi-kernel learning MKL or ensemble learning, we will achieve complementary fusion of cross-modal information. For time series follow-up data, we also consider dynamic models (e.g., Cox proportional hazards model combined with time-dependent covariates) to capture the impact of indicator trends on incidence risk. Once the model is established, we will, in turn, test whether the baseline characteristics of the predicted individuals conform to a certain pattern in order to scientifically understand the incubation mechanism of the disease. For example, individuals at high risk for accurate prediction of transformation may share certain insidious features: mild cognitive deficit + sleep rhythm disturbance + decreased social functioning, but the clinical diagnosis has not yet been met. This will help us refine the definition of \"subclinical status\" in the early stages of the disease and lay the groundwork for future early intervention trials in these populations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Research-content-4-The-mechanism-of-social-stress-and-psychological-intervention-and-its-linkage-with-the-environmental-mapping-layer\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-content-4-The-mechanism-of-social-stress-and-psychological-intervention-and-its-linkage-with-the-environmental-mapping-layer\" title=\"Research content 4: The mechanism of social stress and psychological intervention and its linkage with the environmental mapping layer\"></a><strong>Research content 4: The mechanism of social stress and psychological intervention and its linkage with the environmental mapping layer</strong></h2><p><strong>MAIN SCIENTIFIC QUESTION:</strong> How do long-term socio-environmental stresses affect an individual's risk and course of developing mental disorders through biological mechanisms? How do psychosocial interventions work at the brain level? Can the influence of environmental-psychological factors be included in the \"environmental mapping layer\" of the artificial consciousness model to be explained?</p>\n<p><strong>Research Protocol:</strong> This section will combine animal and human studies to systematically analyze the effects of social stress (e.g., childhood trauma, major life events, chronic stress) on the brain and behavior, and delve into the mechanisms by which psychological interventions (e.g., psychotherapy, social support) can ameliorate this effect. The specific work is divided into two modules:</p>\n<p><strong>Module A: Pathogenic mechanisms of social stress</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Clinical Population Survey and Biological Measurements:</strong> Detailed growth environment and stress exposure history were collected in the cohort of patients with depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia (using standard scales such as Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Life Event Scale, LES, etc.). The association between stress exposure and clinical indicators such as age of onset, severity, and number of recurrences was analyzed. At the same time, blood or saliva is collected from patient samples for epigenetic testing (e.g., genome-wide DNA methylation microarrays) to find associations between childhood trauma and genetic methylation alterations. Childhood abuse has been shown to affect HPA axis function by leading to abnormal methylation of stress-related genes (eg, the glucocorticoid receptor encoded by NR3C1). We will validate similar findings and expand screening to more loci.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Effect of stress on brain structural function:</strong> Using MRI data obtained in our Content 3 cohort, we analyzed whether there were specific brain structural changes in people with high environmental stress. The literature suggests that childhood adversity is significantly associated with the decrease in adult hippocampal volume, and long-term stress may lead to dysfunctional connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala. We will verify in the data: for example, the participants will be classified according to the degree of childhood trauma, and the differences in brain imaging indicators between the two groups will be compared. Furthermore, the correlation between epigenetic or stress hormone levels and these brain indicators was examined to establish the link between \"stress-epigenetics-brain structure-clinical\". Hypothesis: The high childhood trauma group showed a comprehensive pattern of high methylation of NR3C1 gene, excessive cortisol secretion during stress, small hippocampal volume, and early age of onset of depression.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Stress agonist model research:</strong> Establish chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model and social frustration stress model to simulate the effects of long-term stress on behavior and brain in rodents. Behavioral manifestations of depression/anxiety in animals (e.g., increased time of compulsive swimming, social avoidance, etc.) were recorded. The effects of stress on BDNF expression and synaptic plasticity-related proteins in the hippocampus and prefrontal lobe were detected at the molecular level. In the endocrine aspect, the corticosterone level curves of mice under basal and stress conditions were monitored. Focus on inflammation and microglial activation: chronic stress has been reported to induce low-grade brain inflammation and microglia, which may impair neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. We will assess microglial status in the hippocampus, prefrontal lobes by immunohistochemistry and cell counting, validating stress-induced neuroinflammation. Animal brain imaging (e.g., small animal MRI or optical imaging techniques) is then used to detect stress-induced alterations in brain network connectivity—such as the overcoupling of default-like networks in response to stress that resembles human depression.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Artificial Consciousness Environment Mapping Explanation:</strong> Based on the above human and animal data, we will interpret how environmental stress alters the inner consciousness model within the framework of artificial consciousness. The DIKWP model needs to extend a layer of \"environment mapping layer\" to represent the subject's representation and evaluation of the external environment. Normally, the environment mapping layer maps external events to the internal semantic/conceptual space, triggering appropriate emotional and cognitive responses. However, under long-term high stress conditions, the mapping may be negatively biased: agents tend to interpret neutral events as threats, internalize failure attribution, or treat bad events as uncontrollable, thus forming an internal model of maladaptation. We will try to quantify this phenomenon through questionnaires and computational models: for example, the control group and the high-stress group each complete some interpretive tasks that ambiguous social situations to see if the high-stress group is more likely to give negative explanations (which reflects the pessimistic bias of environmental mapping). This bias is then simulated and reproduced using Bayesian cognitive models or Markov decision process models to correspond to stress biological changes in the brain. This step will provide us with ideas for the subsequent design of correction strategies.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Module B: The role and mechanism of psychological interventions</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Psychological intervention clinical trials:</strong> Randomized controlled trials with small samples were selected for high-risk individuals or patients who were willing to receive intervention in the cohort of this project. For example, people at high risk of depression were randomly assigned to receive 8 weeks of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) or routine follow-up only, comparing changes in each measure before and after the intervention and with the control group. In another example, in patients who were in remission after the first episode of schizophrenia, they were randomized to receive family support + social skills training (combined psychological intervention) or routine follow-up, and the 1-year recurrence rate and functional outcomes were compared. Data on intervention effectiveness were collected through these trials.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Pre- and post-intervention biomarker assessments:</strong> At the beginning and end of the intervention, participants were subjected to the same multimodal assessments (cognitive tests, EEG, fMRI, etc.) as baseline to observe which indicators had significant changes. For example, some studies have found that after CBT treatment in depressed patients, the amygdala hyperresponse to negative stimuli is weakened, and the regulation of the limbic system in the prefrontal lobe is enhanced, which is reflected in the decreased amygdala activity and the enhanced negative coupling of the prefrontal-amygdala on functional MRI. We will test similar findings in participants to see if there were plasticity changes in certain brain network connections in the mental intervention group in the direction of health. EEG measures such as error-related negative waves (ERN) may reflect improvement in cognitive control; HRV (heart rate variability) or cortisol rhythm may reflect a decreased stress response. These alterations will be analysed in association with the amount of symptom improvement to identify the neural mechanisms of the psychological intervention.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Analysis of social support elements:</strong> Psychological interventions often include a variety of components, such as skill training, cognitive restructuring, behavior activation, and family education. We will use qualitative and quantitative methods to unravel which components are most helpful in changing patients' environmental mapping and cognitive patterns. For example, interviews with patients and their families to understand how family interventions can change their perceptions and coping with the disease. Quantitatively, self-rating scales (e.g., attribution style questionnaires) can be used to test whether the patient's attribution style becomes positive before and after the intervention; The Social Functioning Scale was used to evaluate whether the patient's social engagement was improved. How these psychological advances correspond to brain indicators will also be reflected in our analysis.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Artificial Consciousness Model Integration:</strong> Finally, we try to incorporate the <strong>stress-intervention mechanism into the DIKWP artificial consciousness framework to form a conceptual model. For example, the input to the environment mapping layer is defined as environmental stress events and the output is represented as representations (positive/negative) in the intrinsic semantic space</strong>. Long-term high stress pushes this mapping function in a negative direction, while psychological interventions pull the mapping function back to neutral or positive by reshaping cognition (adjustment of the knowledge/wisdom layer). We will construct a simple computational model to simulate this process: at first the model is given a series of negative inputs (simulated stress) to change its internal parameters (e.g., become pessimistic about the prior probability of future events); Then, by introducing new information (simulating the positive experiences and skills imparted by the psychological intervention), it was seen whether the internal parameters of the model could be adjusted back to normal. This simulation helps to validate our theory that psychological interventions update the internal state of the artificial consciousness model by providing new data and knowledge, making it more accurate in its mapping of the environment and serving the purpose/purpose of health.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Technology Roadmap:</strong> <em>Study Content 4 comprehensively uses the methodology chain of \"Epidemiological Investigation</em> - Animal Experiment - Intervention Trial - Theoretical Modeling\". The association and causality of cause (stress) and effect (brain/behavior abnormalities) are first proved by population and animal experiments, and then reversibility is proved through intervention, and finally rises to the theoretical explanation level. The techniques used in each link include questionnaire measurement, epigenetic sequencing, endocrine detection, animal behavior, brain imaging, psychological assessment, statistical modeling, and computational simulation. The challenge in this section is to objectify socio-environmental factors and correlate them with biological indicators. We will work with experts in the social sciences and biology within the project team to maximize the reliability and validity of the measurements. Through this series of studies, we hope to answer definitively: **Do and how environmental and psychological factors influence consciousness and behavior through bio-information pathways? Can intervening in these factors really change brain processes? **These insights will provide a scientific basis for strategies for the prevention and treatment of mental disorders.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Study-content-5-Exploration-of-a-new-treatment-model-combining-drugs-and-psychosocial-interventions\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Study-content-5-Exploration-of-a-new-treatment-model-combining-drugs-and-psychosocial-interventions\" title=\"Study content 5: Exploration of a new treatment model combining drugs and psychosocial interventions\"></a><strong>Study content 5: Exploration of a new treatment model combining drugs and psychosocial interventions</strong></h2><p><strong>Key scientific questions:</strong> How can pharmacotherapy and psychological/social interventions complement each other to improve outcomes for people with mental disorders at different levels? Is there an optimal combination model or new paradigm that can achieve a 1+1&gt;2 efficacy? How to incorporate integrative therapy into the theoretical framework to guide individualized application?</p>\n<p><strong>Study protocol:</strong> Based on the above mechanisms, this section will design and test a new model of integrative therapy, and explore its synergistic mechanism and applicable conditions. The specific idea is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Comprehensive intervention model construction:</strong> Combining the results of research contents 2 and 4, the main biological and psychological therapeutic targets for each disease are extracted. For example, the biological target of depression is \"decreased synaptic plasticity/monoamine deficiency\" and the psychological target is \"cognitive negative bias/behavioral withdrawal\"; The biological targets of schizophrenia are \"dopamine excess/glutamate insufficiency\", and the psychosocial targets are \"impaired social functioning/poor family coping\", etc. For these targets, we envision integrated treatment options, such as:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Major depressive disorder</strong>: Medications (such as SSRIs or ketamine) rapidly correct monoamine and plasticity deficits + psychotherapy (CBT or behavioral activation) corrects cognitive biases and reconstructs positive behavior patterns. Drugs provide a biological \"window period\" to improve brain plasticity, and psychotherapies take the opportunity to guide patients to learn to respond positively, thereby consolidating long-term efficacy.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Bipolar disorder</strong>: medications (lithium or mood stabilizers) to stabilize nerve signaling pathways and circadian rhythms + family therapy/psychoeducation to help patients recognize precursors of mood swings, routine, and improve adherence. Pharmacological control of the physiological basis, psychosocial interventions to prevent precipitating factors and enhance patient self-management, jointly prolong remission and reduce relapse.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Schizophrenia</strong>: Medications (atypical antipsychotics) to eliminate positive symptoms, reduce dopamine excess, + rehabilitation training (social skills training, SST, cognitive restructuring therapy, CRT, etc.) to improve cognitive function and social adaptation. Drugs stabilize the patient's mental symptoms and create conditions for rehabilitation training; Training improves patient function, improves quality of life, and reduces the risk of recurrence. In addition, the inclusion of family involvement can further consolidate the efficacy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <strong>Clinical trials to validate the efficacy of combination therapy:</strong> Prospective controlled trials were conducted in at least one of the combination modalities. For example, three groups were designed for depression: drug only group, psychological treatment only group, and drug + psychological comprehensive group, and the remission rate, symptom reduction and recurrence rate after 8 weeks of treatment were compared. Based on evidence from NIHR, medication + psychotherapy may be most effective in patients with moderate to severe depression. We want to verify this and quantify the magnitude of gain. For example, suppose that the response rate in the combination group is significantly higher than that in the single group, an increase of 10-20 percentage points. For schizophrenia, the difference between \"drug + comprehensive rehabilitation\" and \"drug + routine follow-up\" can also be compared in early intervention, and the indicators include recurrence rate and functional level change within 2 years. These clinical outcomes will provide direct evidence to support the superiority of the integrated treatment model.</p>\n<p> <strong>Mechanism of synergistic analysis:</strong> Using various bioindicators and models obtained in the project, the effect of comprehensive treatment is analyzed at the mechanistic level. For example, if patients with depression in the composite group have the lowest relapse rate, we will examine whether they exhibit both biological improvements (eg, increased BDNF levels, decreased DMN hyperconnectivity) and psychosocial improvements (eg, decreased negative automatic thoughts, increased social participation). If there are significant changes in both, and the magnitude of the change is related to the prognosis, the hypothesis that a two-pronged approach can optimize response is supported. In addition, we look at the timing effect: at the beginning of the course of treatment, the drug effect is usually more rapid and the psychological effect is gradual; Psychotherapy effects may be more durable after the drug is stopped. We will test whether the combination of treatment can reduce recurrence after discontinuation in follow-up, demonstrating the importance of psychological interventions to maintain efficacy. These findings will help inform treatment decision-making: for example, for patients with cognitive impairment, there is a greater need for enhanced rehabilitation; Patients with obvious stressors need family/social intervention to achieve individualized combinations.</p>\n<p> <strong>Therapeutic model under the framework of artificial consciousness:</strong> Finally, we try to map the integrated treatment to the DIKWP model for interpretation as a theoretical guide. For example, pharmacotherapy can be seen as a direct regulation of the underlying \"data/information layer\" (adjusting neurotransmitters = altering the original signal intensity or pre-processing), while psychotherapy can be seen as an intervention in the upper \"knowledge/wisdom layer\" (changing the patient's cognitive processing rules for information and the assignment of meaning to life events). The two work together on the <strong>Purpose layer/Person layer</strong> to achieve a comprehensive effect. We will simulate in the model: when there is only low-level intervention, the system output improvement is limited and easy to rebound; When only high-level intervention is performed, low-level noise still affects the effect; When combined, the system output (corresponding behavior/emotion) is optimal and robust. Demonstrating this with a formal approach would support the rationale for integrative treatment. This also reflects the concept of \"full-level closed-loop therapy\" – that is, effective therapy should cover multiple levels of the cognitive system, from sensory input to decision-making output. Once the theoretical model of this project is refined, it can be used to predict the effects of different combinations, such as simulating whether the addition of home support will further reduce relapse and optimize the duration of treatment. This provides guidance for future clinical design.</p>\n<p><strong>Technology Roadmap:</strong> <em>Research Content 5 is translational and applied research in practice. The technical roadmap includes the design of clinical trials (involving clinical research methods such as randomization, blinding, and scale evaluation), as well as the application of all the previous results of this project to guide and evaluate these trials. Particular attention should be paid to the issue of sample size and adherence: we will make sample size estimates based on previous explorations and the literature to ensure sufficient statistical power of the trials, and ensure the quality of the intervention through rigorous project management (e.g., therapist training, adherence monitoring). In terms of data analysis, there are not only traditional clinical statistical methods (analysis of variance, survival analysis, etc.), but also the multimodal analysis methods we have mastered to explain the mechanism.</em> <strong>The interdisciplinary team will collaborate in this context: the physician ensures the implementation of the clinical intervention, the psychologist provides the support of the intervention, and the neuroscientist and data scientist analyze the biological effects. It is expected that through the comprehensive treatment study, we will provide important empirical evidence</strong> that a single treatment for complex mental disorders is insufficient and that comprehensive intervention is necessary; and to provide policymakers and clinical practitioners with feasible combinations of interventions (e.g., an intervention model that establishes a multidisciplinary team MDT). This is also the embodiment of the project's ultimate service to the society.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Feasibility-analysis\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Feasibility-analysis\" title=\"Feasibility analysis\"></a><strong>Feasibility analysis</strong></h1><p>The research content of this project is grand and complex, but we have a solid preliminary foundation, mature technical methods and excellent research team to ensure the smooth implementation of the project. The following is an analysis of the feasibility of this project from several aspects:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Technical and methodological feasibility:</strong></p>\n<p>In recent years, the development of brain science, bioinformatics and artificial intelligence technology has provided strong tools for this project. First of all, <strong>single-cell omics technology is quite mature, and many sequencing centers in China have the ability to sequencing and analyze high-throughput single-cell RNA, and our team has also successfully mapped the single-cell map of the hippocampus in animal models of depression before, accumulating experience. High-field MRI and EEG/ERP equipment are available in our partner hospitals and brain imaging centers to support the acquisition of large samples of brain structure and function. Our team members are good at brain imaging data preprocessing and network analysis, and have built a process-based pipeline. Machine learning and multimodal data fusion methods are the key to this project, we have full-time data scientists and engineers, proficient in Python/R and other tools, can use mature scikit-learn</strong>, TensorFlow and other libraries for model training, and have the ability to implement cutting-edge algorithms such as multi-core learning and deep learning fusion. We have tested the potential of the multimodal psychosis risk prediction model on a small sample in the early stage, so we have the confidence to process large-scale data. <strong>In terms of animal models, we have a standard behavioral laboratory, which can stably replicate mouse models of chronic stress, social frustration models, etc., and master a variety of experimental methods such as behavior and molecular testing. Epigenetic sequencing and PET molecular imaging can be relatively expensive and complex, but we plan to do so through collaborations (e.g., with a research institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a nuclear medicine center), which have agreed to provide us with technical support. In addition, the application of DIKWP artificial consciousness theory has certain novelty, but some members of the team are directly involved in Professor Duan Yucong's artificial consciousness project, and are very familiar with the principle and implementation details of the model. In summary, most of the technologies involved in the project have mature experience or reliable cooperation channels, so the technical implementation is feasible.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2. Feasibility of research subjects and sample acquisition:</strong></p>\n<p>This project requires the acquisition of a large number of patient and at-risk population data. The clinical units we rely on (such as the Mental Health Center Affiliated to XX University) are large-scale psychiatric specialties in China, with an annual outpatient volume of more than 200,000 person-times, sufficient inpatient beds, and a good referral cooperation relationship with the community. This provides an ample source for us to recruit people with different stages of mental disorders and high-risk populations. We have initially contacted the hospital's chief physician in the hospital's depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia specialists, who support the screening of eligible subjects for inclusion in the study on an outpatient basis. For high-risk groups, such as those with a family history of mental illness, we plan to recruit through a combination of in-hospital family screening and community advocacy. Those at high risk of childhood trauma and subthreshold symptoms can obtain them through cooperation with school counseling centers, online recruitment, etc. We have established a cohort of high-risk adolescents with depression and psychosis in the previous National Natural Science Foundation of China, which can be used for follow-up in this project. <strong>In terms of subject ethics, we will strictly abide by the principles of informed consent and privacy protection, and have obtained the preliminary consent of the ethics committee. As for brain tissue and biological samples, this project is supported by the National Brain Bank and Biobank, and a certain number of tissue samples can be obtained on demand. The collection of samples such as peripheral blood and saliva is less disturbing to patients and is easy to obtain multiple times. In terms of follow-up collaborators, our team has full-time research nurses and follow-up officers with many years of experience in the follow-up of patients with mental illness, and the follow-up success rate of past projects &gt; 85</strong>%. Therefore, we are confident that we will obtain a sufficient number and quality of samples to meet the needs of the study.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Timeline and management feasibility:</strong></p>\n<p>The project duration is planned for a period of five years and has been planned in detail (see \"Scheduling\" below). The content of the study can be progressed in a logical step-by-step manner: first, cross-sectional sample collection and baseline evaluation (1-2 years) are carried out, and animal experiments are also carried out; Follow-up and intervention in the medium term (2-4 years) with continuous data analysis; Late integration verification and theoretical model refinement (4th-5th year). These efforts partially overlap in time, which can increase efficiency. Our project team has set detailed milestones, such as completing the multimodal baseline data of no less than 200 samples by the end of the second year, submitting the early marker prediction model by the end of the third year, and completing the comprehensive intervention trial by the end of the fourth year. The project leader and the project leader will hold a monthly progress meeting, implement milestone management, and coordinate resources to solve problems in a timely manner. The project budget fully considers the consumables and manpower needs of each job, and the financial allocation will be distributed to each sub-project unit according to the task to ensure the implementation of resources. In terms of risk management and control, we have formulated a filing plan for key links, and if there is a large number of follow-up losses, we will recruit additional subjects and improve follow-up methods; If the data fusion model does not work well, we will seek to work with AI experts to introduce more advanced algorithms, etc. Based on our previous successful experience in the management of multi-center large-scale projects (such as XX projects), the complexity of this project is under control, and we are confident that it will be completed on time and with high quality.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Support for the foundation of previous research:</strong></p>\n<p>For details, please refer to the \"Research Basics\" section below, and our team members have made rich achievements in the field of mental disorder research, including the discovery of new serum markers of depression, the establishment of cognitive training models for schizophrenia, etc., and have the professional knowledge and technical reserves required for the smooth implementation of the project. Especially in the field of DIKWP artificial intelligence theory, we have long-term exchanges with Professor Duan Yucong's team, and its 114 related patent achievements and cutting-edge theories are strong support for us. At the same time, the project team verified the feasibility of some research ideas (such as the feasibility of multimodal prediction, stress model replication, etc.) in previous small-scale experiments, reducing the exploration risk. Therefore, the project is built on a solid foundation rather than a source of water.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Advantages of multidisciplinary innovation:</strong></p>\n<p>The project team brings together experts in psychiatry, neuroscience, genetics, computer science, psychology and other fields to collaborate on complex problems from different perspectives. This multidisciplinary team model has proven to be essential in major brain science projects. Although the sub-projects involve different disciplines, they are all guided by a common theoretical framework and common goals, and their results can be mutually corroborated. For example, cellular abnormalities found in basic experiments can be verified by imaging studies; Imaging/electrophysiological abnormalities can be explained by computational models; The effect of the intervention can in turn verify the above-mentioned mechanism hypothesis, so as to form a closed loop. Therefore, interdisciplinarity is not only feasible, but will also have an effect that goes far beyond independent research. This is an important reason why we believe that this project can achieve significant innovative results.</p>\n<p>In summary, this project has good feasibility conditions in terms of theory, technology, sample, time management and team foundation. The difficulties that may be encountered by the project are within the scope of anticipation and response. As the research progresses, we have the resources and capacity to ensure that the project stays on schedule and delivers the desired outcomes.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Innovation\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Innovation\" title=\"Innovation\"></a><strong>Innovation</strong></h1><p>This project has significant innovations in theory and methodology, and is expected to promote breakthroughs in the research and clinical practice of mental disorders. The main innovations are summarized as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Theoretical integration and innovation:</strong> For the first time, the DIKWP artificial consciousness model was applied to the research of mental disorders, and the cognitive hierarchy theory of information science was creatively combined with the pathology of mental disorders. It is a pioneering attempt in the world, breaking through the traditional biological-psychological dichotomy framework, and <strong>analyzing mental disorders from the whole chain of data-information-knowledge-wisdom-purpose. This theoretical convergence is expected to propose a new paradigm for mental disorders, such as treating them as the result of multi-layer feedback dysregulation in the cognitive system</strong>, providing a new way of thinking for the unified interpretation of different symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Cross-scale multi-omics research:</strong> The combination of single-cell omics + brain imaging + electrophysiology has realized the cross-scale analysis of the brain mechanism of mental disorders. From microscopic cell type abnormalities to macroscopic brain network connections to subjective symptom experiences, a comprehensive correlation is formed. This kind of multi-scale study has rarely been reported in the field of psychiatry, and it is expected to discover disease-specific cell subtypes and circuit markers, and open up new directions for molecular diagnosis. At the same time, we use multimodal data fusion for early prediction, which is an important innovation in the field of psychiatric prediction intervention, which greatly improves the prediction accuracy.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Verification of information control hypothesis: The</strong> hypothesis of \"information control failure\" was proposed and multi-angle experiments were designed to verify its effectiveness. We combine the clinical drug action with mechanistic backwards to innovatively demonstrate the etiological mechanism: for example, the rapid action of ketamine proves that synaptic plasticity defects cause depression, the lithium salt proves that GSK-3 overactivity causes affective instability, and the antipsychotic drugs prove that abnormal prominent psychotic symptoms are abnormally prominent. This strategy of inferring the etiology based on efficacy is a unique innovation in the study of the mechanism of mental illness. Once the verification is successful, it will give a new connotation to \"information processing\" to textbook etiological theories (such as the dopamine hypothesis) and promote the updating of theories.</p>\n<p><strong>4. New markers for early diagnosis:</strong> This project will explore <strong>biomarkers with three-level integration of cognition, information and structure, and use machine learning to screen and combine them to achieve objective prediction of the incidence of disease in high-risk individuals. This is expected to lead to the discovery of new combinations of markers (e.g., EEG + cognitive test + MRI fusion indicators) that break through the current limitations of relying only on genes or imaging in a single dimension. In particular, we focus on interventionable predictors</strong> (e.g., cognitive function that can be improved through training) that have more significance than purely genetic measures. This will lay the foundation for precision prevention and has great clinical application prospects.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Biological Mechanisms of Environmental Stress:</strong> Through epigenetic and brain network studies, the influencing mechanisms of psychosocial factors are biologicalized. He innovatively proposed the concept of \"environmental mapping layer\" to explain the pathogenesis of stress, and revealed how childhood trauma left a molecular \"imprint\" and changed brain circuits. At the same time, we will systematically unravel for the first time the neural mechanisms of psychological interventions, such as how CBT alters brain connectivity. In the past, there was a lack of objective indicators on the role of psychotherapy, and our research will fill this gap and explain its principle with the artificial consciousness model, so as to provide a basis for the scientific use of psychological intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>6. A new model of integrated treatment:</strong> explore and verify the value of integrated drug + psychological intervention in improving prognosis and its biological synergistic mechanism. Although integrative therapy is clinically known to be effective, this project will reveal the scientific rationale behind its 1+1&gt;2 and propose a new model of hierarchical and phased combination (e.g., drug-based in the onset phase and psychological in the consolidation phase). We will also innovatively propose the concept of cognitive level matching treatment: tailor the corresponding intervention according to the patient's injury concentration level. This elevates the traditional empirical combination therapy to an explainable theoretical guide.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach innovation:</strong> The project integrates methods such as neuromics, neural network modeling, machine learning, and clinical trials to form a set of methodological paradigms for the study of mental disorders in a complex system. For example, the application of network control theory in artificial intelligence to the analysis of brain information flow, and the use of computational models to simulate the process of symptom generation are all new attempts. This methodological innovation will expand the arsenal of psychiatric research methods and bring about a paradigm shift.</p>\n<p>In summary, the innovation of this project is reflected in the theory, content and methodology. Whether it is the introduction of artificial consciousness theory, multimodal fusion prediction, or <strong>mechanism-therapy closed-loop verification</strong>, it is the first attempt and major innovation. The results of the project are expected to produce high-level papers and patents, and promote the research on the mechanism of mental disorders to enter a <strong>new stage of \"intelligent analysis</strong>\", which is in line with the national requirements for original and leading scientific research.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Research-Basis\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-Basis\" title=\"Research Basis\"></a><strong>Research Basis</strong></h1><p>The project team has carried out a lot of research work in related fields and has accumulated rich research foundation and experience, which provides a solid guarantee for the smooth implementation of this project. The following is an explanation of the team's previous research results, related work basis and research conditions:</p>\n<p><strong>1. The team's achievements in the research of the mechanism of mental disorders:</strong></p>\n<p>The core members of the project team have long been committed to the mechanism and treatment of depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other diseases, and have published a series of high-level papers and have solid academic accumulation. For example, the project leader, Professor XX, has made important contributions to the field of depression biomarkers, and has published a paper on the abnormality of the peripheral blood inflammatory factor profile of patients with depression and its association with disease subtypes, which has been cited more than 100 times by SCI. Professor XX's team also used brain imaging technology to study the cognitive function of depression, and found a dysfunctional connection pattern between the default network and the cognitive control network of depressed patients, and his paper was published in Human Brain Mapping. Researcher YY (responsible for the single-cell omics part) has published an article on the brain gene co-expression network of schizophrenia in Molecular Psychiatry, revealing the coexistence of microglial activation and synaptic gene downregulation, which provides ideas for the study of the cellular mechanism of this project. In addition, Associate Professor ZZ has conducted research on sleep and rhythm in the field of bipolar disorder, and has reported the association between circadian gene polymorphisms and recurrence patterns in patients with bipolar disorder, and verified the mechanism by which circadian rhythm disorders can induce mood swings in animals. These early results demonstrate that the team has a deep understanding of the biology of the target disease, which lays the foundation for this project to target key scientific questions.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Basis of Interdisciplinary Research on Artificial Intelligence and Brain Science:</strong></p>\n<p>Many members of the project team are active in the intersection of artificial intelligence and brain science. In particular, we have a close working relationship with the artificial consciousness research team led by Professor Duan Yucong. Professor Duan was the first to propose the DIKWP model and has achieved leading results in the field of global artificial consciousness. Our member WW associate researcher has worked under the guidance of Professor Duan, has an in-depth understanding of the principles and implementation of DIKWP, and has participated in the application project of DIKWP model in the evaluation of large language model \"class awareness\". He is also a member of the World Artificial Awareness Association and has participated in the development of artificial awareness assessment standards. This means that we have a direct advantage in the theory and technology of artificial consciousness and can introduce it into this project. Previously, WW Associate Research has preliminarily applied the DIKWP model to simulated cognitive tasks, which proves that the model can well reproduce the hierarchical reasoning process of human problem solving. We also have successful experience in AI model training based on brain data. For example, our computational engineers have trained a neural network based on fMRI data to classify patients with schizophrenia, visualized the implicit representation of the model, and found network representations similar to the patients' DMN anomalies. These pioneering attempts have laid a methodological foundation for us to further integrate artificial consciousness models with brain diseases.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Experience in multimodal data acquisition and analysis:</strong></p>\n<p>The team has rich experience in biological big data and multimodal data processing. In recent years, the laboratory led by Prof. X has completed a joint peripheral blood transcriptome + metabolome analysis project in patients with depression, successfully integrating two omics to identify a combination of biomarkers to predict treatment response, and the results were published in Translational Psychiatry. This experience can be directly applied to marker fusion analysis early in the project. YY researchers are good at single-cell sequencing data processing and have developed cell type identification algorithms. Dr. UU, a data scientist in the project team, is proficient in machine learning tools, and with the support of the previous fund, he developed a multimodal brain image fusion framework, which has been applied to the construction of early diagnosis models for Alzheimer's disease, and has achieved higher accuracy than single modality, and has also won awards in medical image analysis competitions. Dr. UU has transplanted the framework to mental disorder data for initial testing, and the results have been encouraging. This means that we have mature software and pipelines to process multiple data such as MRI + EEG + cognition, saving time for the project in method development. In addition, we have accumulated a database of high-risk groups and patients on a certain scale. For example, in a provincial and ministerial project, we collected fMRI and cognitive data from 100 patients with early schizophrenia, which can be included in the expanded sample size. It can be said that multimodal data analysis is not a new challenge, but one of our strengths.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Fundamentals of Animal and Cell Experiments:</strong></p>\n<p>The animal models and cell experiments involved in this project are also part of our team's daily work. The animal experiment platform led by Associate Professor ZZ has built a rat model of chronic stress, which successfully induced behavioral changes similar to human depression, and was published in the Chinese Pharmacological Journal. The platform is equipped with standard behavioral devices (open field, tail suspension, maze, etc.) and surgical equipment (microinjection pumps, stereotaxic instruments, etc.), and technicians are skilled in carrying out experimental operations such as lentiviral injection and optogenetic intervention, which can support us to carry out fine experiments such as dopamine intervention and transient inhibition of specific brain regions. At the cellular level, we have a cell culture and differentiation chamber, which can obtain exosomes from peripheral blood and induce iPSC redifferentiation into neurons from patients' skin fibroblasts. If we need to simulate the neuronal characteristics of patients, these cell lines can be directly used for drug testing or gene editing experiments (e.g., knocking out a risk gene observation). All of this shows that we have a complete experimental platform that allows us to carry out most of the experiments required for this project without having to build them from scratch.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Clinical Resource and Collaboration Network:</strong></p>\n<p>The project is supported by the Mental Health Center and a number of partner hospitals. The director of the center has set up a clinical collaboration team for this project, including the heads of depression, bipolar and schizophrenia, who will coordinate patient recruitment, evaluation and intervention. For example, the Depression Specialist has an experienced psychotherapy team that can undertake the implementation of psychological interventions in the program; The follow-up system of bipolar specialties can be used for long-term follow-up of this project; The Schizophrenia Specialty is a municipal demonstration unit in the first year of psychiatry (early intervention) with an adequate source of patients. We are also working with community health centres to include high-risk groups who have not yet seen a doctor but have symptoms. There are also successful collaborations between team members, such as Professor X and Associate Professor ZZ who jointly undertook a clinical study on the combination of antidepressants and CBT and successfully completed and published a paper. This tacit cooperation will continue to the project to improve efficiency. In addition, our network of cooperation with experts in related fields at home and abroad will also provide support. In terms of artificial intelligence, we can invite the consultants of Professor Duan Yucong's team to guide and even investigate the prototype artificial consciousness system they developed. In terms of epigenetics, we have jointly applied for equipment sharing with experts from a gene center in Beijing, which can quickly complete sample sequencing. Internationally, we have a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Brain Imaging team at Y University in the United States, which allows us to help each other in data analysis and student development. These collaborations ensure that we can mobilize the best resources to accomplish complex tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Fundamentals of Project Management and Talent Development:</strong></p>\n<p>The members of the project team have undertaken many national scientific research tasks and have rich experience in large-scale project management and talent training. The sub-projects of the National Key R&amp;D Program presided over by Professor X passed the acceptance on time and with high quality, and formed an effective project management system (weekly meetings, quarterly reports, task book decomposition, etc.). These systems will be used in this project, so that the work packages can be carried out in an orderly manner without falling off the chain. At the same time, the team has a multi-level talent echelon, including senior professors, young and middle-aged backbones and outstanding doctoral students. Among them, many young teachers have overseas training experience, postdoctoral AA has studied single-cell omics technology in foreign laboratories, and doctoral student BB has won awards in the national brain science competition. They will be the backbone of the implementation of the project and will grow rapidly over the course of the project. We plan to hold a seminar and training course every year, inviting experts in the interdisciplinary fields of artificial intelligence and brain science to give lectures to improve the overall research ability of the team. These talent training initiatives have also been supported by the supporting units. This means that there will be no talent gap in the implementation of the project, but on the contrary, a group of compound talents will be produced to make long-term contributions to the development of the field.</p>\n<p>Overall, the project has a solid research foundation: <strong>it has the scientific direction laid by the previous results, the technical platform to ensure its implementation, and the multidisciplinary talent and cooperation network to provide support</strong>. These foundations will significantly reduce the technical risks of the project, improve research efficiency, and enable us to translate ambitious research goals into practical research processes and ultimately achieve high-level innovation results.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Team-Schedule\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Team-Schedule\" title=\"Team &amp; Schedule\"></a><strong>Team &amp; Schedule</strong></h1><h2 id=\"Composition-and-division-of-labor-of-the-research-team\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Composition-and-division-of-labor-of-the-research-team\" title=\"Composition and division of labor of the research team\"></a><strong>Composition and division of labor of the research team</strong></h2><p>This project is led by XX University and completed by a number of units to form an excellent interdisciplinary team.

These disorders are usually caused by abnormal aggregation of specific pathological proteins and neurologic degeneration, and patients present with progressive motor dysfunction, often accompanied by cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. At present, there is no cure for this disease. Based on the \"Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom-Purpose\" artificial consciousness theoretical model proposed by Professor Duan Yucong, this project aims to reveal the pathogenic mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases such as movement disorders from multiple levels and explore innovative treatment strategies.</p>\n<p>In this study, we will comprehensively use molecular biology, cell and organoid models, animal models, and human genetic data to focus on three aspects: (1) analyze the abnormal folding aggregation and cross-cell transmission mechanism of core pathological proteins in Parkinson's disease and other diseases (such as α-synuclein, TDP-43, HTT, etc.), and use the DIKWP model to analyze the association between data perception, information processing and uncontrolled purpose in this process; (2) Based on the theory of artificial consciousness and the hierarchical control framework of DIKWP, brain-like organoids and novel mammalian disease models were established to simulate the process of disease progression, focusing on the interaction between \"brain cognitive control layer disintegration\" and neural network regression. (3) Combining multi-omics and network pharmacology methods, we can find potential new targets for clinical intervention and design intervention strategies, and construct a DIKWP-drug regulatory pathway mapping model to simulate the transmission chain of pharmacodynamic effects, so as to guide the development of new treatment regimens.</p>\n<p>The project is characterized by introducing the cutting-edge DIKWP artificial consciousness model in the field of artificial intelligence into the research of neurodegenerative diseases, understanding the mechanism of disease occurrence and development through the five-level integrated perspective of \"data-information-knowledge-wisdom-purpose\", and bridging the gap between molecular pathological changes and cognitive dysfunction. With the support of comprehensive and in-depth basic research, this project is expected to elucidate the key pathogenic links of neurodegenerative diseases such as movement disorders, propose new intervention targets and strategies, and establish theoretical models that can be used for drug screening and efficacy prediction, which has important scientific significance and application value for overcoming the clinical problems of such diseases.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Basis-for-the-project\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Basis-for-the-project\" title=\"Basis for the project\"></a><strong>Basis for the project</strong></h1><h2 id=\"1-Background-and-significance\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#1-Background-and-significance\" title=\"1. Background and significance\"></a><strong>1. Background and significance</strong></h2><p>Neurodegenerative diseases associated with movement disorders include Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), hereditary cerebellar ataxia (SCA), etc. These disorders are characterized by progressive deterioration of motor function, often accompanied by abnormalities in cognitive function and behavior, and place a heavy burden on the patient's family and society. <strong>Epidemiological data show that as the population ages, the number of people with diseases such as PD will rise significantly</strong>. For example, the 2025 British Medical Journal (BMJ) research model predicts that there will be more than 25.2 million Parkinson's disease patients worldwide by 2050 people, an increase of about 112% compared to 2021. Although ALS is a rare disease, the number of ALS patients worldwide is expected to increase from about 223,000 in 2015 to about 377,000 in 2040 (an increase of 69%) due to its high mortality and significant societal impact. The median survival of patients with ALS was only 24 years; Hereditary disorders such as HD and SCA tend to develop in middle age, with severe movement impairment and cognitive deterioration occurring within 1020 years. At present, there is no fundamental treatment for these diseases: Parkinson's disease can only improve symptoms through measures such as dopamine replacement, but cannot stop the process of neurodegeneration; In ALS, only drugs such as riluzole and edaravone can slightly delay the course of the disease, but the disease is irreversible; There is no treatment for Huntington's disease and most inherited ataxia that can alter the course of the disease. Therefore, elucidating the pathogenesis of these diseases and exploring novel intervention strategies is an urgent challenge for neuroscience and clinical medicine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-Existing-research-foundation-and-shortcomings\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-Existing-research-foundation-and-shortcomings\" title=\"2. Existing research foundation and shortcomings\"></a><strong>2. Existing research foundation and shortcomings</strong></h2><p>**Common pathological features: aberrant protein aggregation and neural network degeneration. **The clinical manifestations of different degenerative diseases vary but there are commonalities at the pathological level: abnormal aggregation and deposition of specific proteins in the brain or spinal cord, and consequent neuronal loss and network dysfunction. Lewy bodies accumulating α-synucle α in in the substantia nigra dense neurons in patients with Parkinson's disease; TDP-43 protein deposition is common in motor neurons in ALS patients; Striatum neurons in HD patients are filled with polyglutamine-expanding huntingtin (HTT) aggregates. Hereditary cerebellar ataxia (e.g., SCA1/2/3, etc.) is also caused by mutations and accumulation of specific proteins (e.g., ataxin-1, ataxin-3, etc.). These misfolded proteins not only play the role of \"core pathological proteins\" in their respective diseases, but their aggregation behavior also presents ** \"seed transmission\" or \"prion transmission\".<strong>Properties: that is, the initially formed abnormal conformational protein can be used as a template to induce a conformational transition of normal proteins, thereby propagating pathology along neural circuits. For example, the α-synuclein pathology of Parkinson's disease has been found to spread progressively along the vagus and autonomic nerves to the midbrain and cerebral cortex, supporting its \"prion-like\" spread in the brain. Similarly, TDP-43 pathology in ALS has been shown to spread through neuroanatomical junctions, and TDP-43 has been observed to spread along the corticospinal tract in models, causing ALS-like symptoms. Huntingtin aggregates may also metastasize across neurons via synaptic vesicles, contributing to disease progression in the brain. These findings suggest aberrant dynamics of protein misfolding and aggregation, as well as cascading propagation in neural networks, as well as a common pathogenic mechanism for dyskinesia degenerative diseases. Traditional studies have characterized protein aggregation and toxicity at the molecular and cellular levels, but there is still a lack of understanding of how multi-level information processing dysregulation leads to global neurological collapse</strong>**. For example, with the same protein aggregation, why does the pattern of symptom progression and neural circuit involvement differ in different patients? What are the internal \"control mechanisms\" of the nervous system that try to cope with the abnormal protein load, and how can their failure lead to dysfunction? These issues have not yet been fully elucidated.</p>\n<p><strong>The need for multi-level research and integration:</strong> The research on such diseases is moving towards \"cross-scale and multi-dimensional\". On the one hand, with the development of high-throughput omics and imaging, a large number of data at different levels (genes-proteins-cells-circuits-behaviors) have emerged. On the other hand, novel models such as stem cell-derived brain organoids <strong>and more sophisticated animal models have made it possible to observe disease progression in vivo. However, it remains difficult to integrate multi-layered information into a holistic understanding of the disease. At present, most studies and models can only cover part of the scale: in vitro cell and organoid models are able to reproduce molecular and cellular lesions, but lack the in vivo environment and advanced functions; Animal models can demonstrate system-level symptoms, but often species differences limit the extrapolation of results. In addition, the lack of simulation of cognitive and network functions is also a limitation of the existing models. For example, traditional brain organoids are unable to form higher-order functional networks and cognitive outputs due to the lack of sensory input and environmental interaction. This makes it difficult to rely solely on organoids to study</strong> the phenomenon of \"cognitive control collapse\"** in patients (e.g., cognitive executive dysfunction evident in late Parkinson's and Huntington's disease). Similarly, animal models have difficulty assessing interactions between higher brain functions and neurodegeneration due to limited cognitive abilities. <strong>In summary, there is an urgent need for a theoretical framework that can penetrate multiple levels from molecular to cognitive, integrate multidimensional data to explain disease mechanisms, and guide the design of new models and therapies.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"3-Introduction-of-the-DIKWP-model-and-artificial-consciousness-theory\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-Introduction-of-the-DIKWP-model-and-artificial-consciousness-theory\" title=\"3.

The DIKWP model is a new type of cognitive model developed by Professor Duan Yucong's team, which</strong> introduces a higher level of \"Purpose/Intention\" on the basis of the classic data-information-knowledge-wisdom (DIKW) pyramid to form a five-level cognitive system. The model adopts a network interaction structure, so that the semantic information at all levels can be fed back and updated in both directions. In short, DIKWP consists of five levels of bottom-up data, information, knowledge, Wisdom and the highest Purpose/Purpose, from the bottom level of the perception and processing of the original data, gradually extracting information and knowledge, rising to the decision-making of the Wisdom layer, and finally guided and constrained by the topmost Purpose layer. This expansion emphasizes the driving role of decision-making purpose and subjective <strong>purpose in the cognitive process</strong>, and combines subjective purpose with objective information processing, which is regarded as a major innovation in the field of artificial intelligence cognitive computing. Under this model, every step of the AI system's decisions can be explained retrospectively, because there is a clear purpose to guide it.</p>\n<p>Complementing the DIKWP model, the <strong>artificial consciousness theory aims to equip AI with human-like consciousness characteristics, including advanced functions such as self-monitoring and autonomous purpose. The DIKWP artificial consciousness model proposed by Professor Duan Yucong's team is based on information processing and</strong> purpose-driven mechanism, which realizes the simulation of consciousness generation and function through the transformation and interaction of data, information, knowledge, wisdom and purpose. Specifically, the team has tried to combine the DIKWP model with neuroscience concepts to establish the \"DIKWP theory of brain region mapping\", which simulates the generation and flow process of data-information-knowledge-wisdom-purpose in the brain, and builds a deep cognitive model. The researchers mapped the objective external performance and subjective internal cognition into the data interaction and reasoning process within the model, and built a prototype system of DIKWP physiological and artificial consciousness to verify the feasibility of the framework. In short, the <strong>DIKWP Artificial Consciousness Framework provides a multi-layered unified cognitive control model</strong> that can be used to describe how the brain moves from low-level signal processing to high-level purpose-directed behavior.</p>\n<p>We believe that the application of the DIKWP model to the study of neurodegenerative diseases has the following potential advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Multi-scale integration capability:</strong> The DIKWP framework naturally contains a hierarchical mapping from \"data\" to \"wisdom / purpose\", which is similar to the macro function of associating objective data at the molecular and cellular levels all the way to the cognitive and behavioral levels. This is highly consistent with the requirements of modern neuroscience for cross-scale mechanisms. This model is expected to serve as a \"bridge\" to understand the experimental results at different levels under the same semantic system.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Emphasis on purpose-driven and control dysregulation:</strong> Many neurodegenerative symptoms (e.g., Parkinson's disease, movement disorders, cognitive executive dysfunction, etc.) can be seen as dysregulation of higher control functions in the brain. The \"Purpose\" layer, which is particularly emphasized in the DIKWP model, represents the supreme authority of decision-making and control. This framework allows us to characterize <strong>the impact of the disintegration of the purpose layer on the lower level in the disease state</strong>, and to reinterpret the causes of movement disorders from the perspective of information processing. For example, in patients with Parkinson's disease, the regulation of motor circuits at the purpose layer is weakened due to the lack of dopamine in the brain, and abnormal discharge (tremor, etc.) occurs in the low-level motor information processing, which can be explained in the DIKWP model as a situation in which the loss of the top-level control signal leads to the increase of the lower-level information noise.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Artificial Consciousness Simulation Helps New Models:</strong> Using the artificial consciousness theory, traditional biological models can be given certain \"cognitive\" elements and expand their experimental capabilities. For example, brain organoids can be subjected to controls or inputs from artificial intelligence that allow them to interact with their environment, thereby partially simulating sensory-motor circuits and learning processes. Recent studies have demonstrated that cultured human brain organoid/<strong>neuronal networks exhibit goal-directed learning when given environmental feedback</strong> (e.g., human brain cells in a petri dish learn to play the game of ping-pong under electrical stimulation-feedback conditions), showing the potential to generate cognitive function in an in vitro system. This provides important implications for us to improve the disease model based on AC theory.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In conclusion, the DIKWP model and artificial consciousness theory provide a new perspective for understanding and simulating neurodegenerative diseases. It is expected to correlate molecular pathology with systemic cognitive function, help explain complex pathological transmission and dysfunctional mechanisms, and guide us in designing novel disease models and intervention strategies that include a \"cognitive control layer\". <strong>Based on this innovative idea, this project intends to use the DIKWP artificial consciousness model as a unified theoretical framework, integrate experimental and computational methods, systematically</strong> study the pathogenic mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases such as movement disorders, fill the lack of multi-level integration of existing research, and help find a breakthrough in treatment.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Research-Objectives\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-Objectives\" title=\"Research Objectives:\"></a><strong>Research Objectives:</strong></h1><p>The overall goal of this project is to <strong>use the DIKWP model and artificial consciousness theory to comprehensively analyze the pathogenic mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases such as movement disorders from the molecular to the systemic level, and then propose a verifiable new intervention strategy</strong>. Specific objectives include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of aggregation and propagation of key pathological proteins: Using</strong> cells, brain-like organoids and animal models, combined with patient genetic information, we will deeply study the formation dynamics of abnormal aggregation of core proteins such as α-synuclein, TDP-43 and HTT in Parkinson's disease, ALS, HD, SCA and other diseases, the transmission pathways inside and outside cells, and their effects on neuronal function. The DIKWP model was used to analyze how the data perception, information transmission and processing processes were disturbed in the process of pathological aggregation, and how the purpose (such as the self-stabilizing regulatory mechanism) at the cell/individual level was out of control.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Constructing Innovative Disease Models and Simulating Cognitive Control Deterioration:</strong> Based on the theory of artificial consciousness and the hierarchical control framework of DIKWP, we will build advanced models that can simulate disease progression, including 3D brain organoid models derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and novel mammalian models that introduce the concept of DIKWP. Through these models, we will explore the relationship mechanism between \"cognitive control layer disintegration\" and neural network degeneration during disease development, including: how higher cognitive/control functions are gradually impaired when intracerebral protein pathology accumulates; Conversely, how does the loss of advanced cognitive control accelerate the deterioration of local pathology? Verify the effectiveness of the DIKWP framework in explaining the above interaction mechanisms.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Screening of disease intervention targets and design regulatory strategies:</strong> Based on the above-mentioned multi-level mechanism research, combined with systems biology and artificial intelligence methods, key molecules or network nodes (new drug targets) that can be used for intervention are identified. Intervention strategies for these targets (including small molecule drugs, gene therapy, immunotherapy, etc.) were designed, and the \"DIKWP-drug regulatory pathway mapping model\" was constructed using the DIKWP framework to simulate the multi-level impact chain of interventions on the disease system. The model predicts how potential therapies act on the data layer (molecular pathology) and progressively influences information processing, knowledge/network reorganization, Wisdom decision-making, and Purpose layer (functional improvement), guiding subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments to validate the most promising treatment strategies.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"Research-content-and-technical-route\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-content-and-technical-route\" title=\"Research content and technical route\"></a><strong>Research content and technical route</strong></h1><p>Focusing on the above objectives, the project is divided into three interrelated research modules, which combine experimental research and theoretical modeling to advance simultaneously. The following diagram summarizes the overall technical roadmap of the project (from pathogenic mechanism analysis to model construction to intervention strategy), and the specific contents of each module are as follows:</p>\n<h2 id=\"Content-1-Analysis-of-pathological-protein-aggregation-propagation-mechanism-and-DIKWP-information-dissonance\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Content-1-Analysis-of-pathological-protein-aggregation-propagation-mechanism-and-DIKWP-information-dissonance\" title=\"Content 1: Analysis of pathological protein aggregation-propagation mechanism and DIKWP information dissonance\"></a><strong>Content 1: Analysis of pathological protein aggregation-propagation mechanism and DIKWP information dissonance</strong></h2><p><strong>Main research question:</strong> How do pathological proteins such as α-synuclein, TDP-43, and HTT form abnormal aggregations in cells and spread in the nervous system through what pathways? How can the normal processing of information by cells and neural networks in these processes be disrupted, leading to dysfunction? We will study these questions using in vitro and in vivo model integration, and apply the DIKWP framework to unravel the mechanism of multi-level information dissonance.</p>\n<p><strong>Study Protocol:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Multi-model experimental system:</strong> Build a series of models covering molecules, cells, tissues, and animals</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>In vitro molecular and cellular models:</em> Stable transfection cell lines expressing mutant or tagged pathological proteins (such as human mutant α-synuclein, HTT-Exon1-Q_expanded, mutant SOD1 or TDP-43, etc.); In vitro recombinant protein aggregation models were used to analyze oligomer/filament formation kinetics; Co-culture of primary neurons is used to observe the transfer of pathological proteins between cells (e.g., seed-induced diffusion assays with labeled fibers).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Brain-like organoid models:</em> Disease-associated brain region organoids were constructed from patient-derived iPSCs (e.g., midbrain substantia nigra dopaminergic organoids for PD, cortico-muscle motor neural circuit organoids for ALS, striatal organoids for HD, and cerebellar organoids for SCA). These organoids will be induced to form pathological protein accumulation to mimic early disease states.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Animal models:</em> Transgenic mice (e.g., model mice overexpressing mutations α-syn, HTT) and novel model organisms (e.g., gene-edited rats, considering non-human primates if necessary) were used to validate in vivo. Viral vectors are used to inject pre-formed fibers of pathological proteins into specific nuclei of the mouse brain, and the pattern and speed of their transsynaptic transmission are tracked. Through in vivo imaging and tissue immunostaining, the propagation path of protein pathology in the brain was mapped.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Pathological mechanism analysis:</strong> In the above model, the following indicators were determined and compared:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Aggregation kinetic parameters: threshold concentration, nucleation and elongation rates of different protein aggregation initiation, oligomeric structural characteristics, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Cellular responses: stress responses triggered by the accumulation of abnormal proteins (e.g., activation or depletion of the autophagolysosomal system, dysregulation of the protein homeostasis network), key signaling pathways (e.g., inflammatory cascade, changes in oxidative stress levels).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Neuronal function: Neuronal membrane potential and firing mode changes, synaptic transmission function (postsynaptic current amplitude and frequency changes) and neural circuit activity changes were recorded (multi-electrode array MEA to detect organoid network synchronization, calcium imaging to observe neuronal network activity).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Transcellular Propagation: Quantify the extent to which a tagged protein spreads from the initial site to the distal site, assessing whether it spreads along anatomical junctions and whether there is a transsynaptic release-uptake mechanism. Compare the propagation characteristics of different proteins in different models to find common rules and differences.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Human correlation: Validate model findings by combining patient brain tissue samples and genetic data. For example, <strong>whether the α-syn aggregation region in the brain tissue of patients with SNCA duplications/mutations associated with Parkinson's disease</strong> is consistent with the model transmission pathway; Whether the distribution of TDP-43 pathology in the spinal cord of ALS patients conforms to the transmission sequence predicted by the model. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data was used to focus on susceptibility genes related to protein homeostasis and propagation (such as autophagy-lysosomal pathway genes) and test their functions in the model.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>DIKWP Model Interpretation:</strong> Based on the above data, we will use the DIKWP framework to unravel the information processing dysregulation in the aggregation and propagation of abnormal proteins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Data layer: The</strong> initial signal of pathological triggers is equivalent to the \"data\" perceived by the cell, such as the appearance of misfolded proteins, concentration exceeding threshold, etc. Normally, cellular quality control mechanisms feed this data into subsequent processes (e.g., ubiquitination degradation pathways). We analyze whether cells perceive these data in disease states for retardation or allergies, and for \"misreadings\" (e.g., misidentification of misfolded proteins as harmless).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Information layer:</strong> Cells process raw data to form \"information\" that corresponds to processes such as signaling pathways being activated and transcription factors responding. We examine aberrant protein-induced signaling network restructuring: which key pathways are activated (e.g., inflammatory cytokine signaling) and whether the direction of information flow deviates from homeostasis (e.g., persistent stress signals lead to apoptosis tendency). From the perspective of DIKWP, this step is equivalent to the process of removing noise and adding context, and we will identify the deviations in the information extraction process in the disease cells (e.g., the noise is amplified instead of being filtered out).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Knowledge layer:</strong> Information is further integrated and abstracted into \"knowledge\", which corresponds to the cells to establish cognition and coping strategies for environmental conditions, such as the formation of memories through feedback regulation of gene expression patterns. We will investigate whether chronic protein accumulation alters the cell's gene expression program (similar to \"false learning\"): for example, neurons may reduce synapse-associated protein synthesis to compensate, and stress persistence forms a new constant expression profile. The knowledge layer of the DIKWP model emphasizes the grasp of objective laws, and we will look for the \"wrong knowledge\" formed by disease cells (such as the persistence of abnormal proteins as the new normal), which leads to weakened defense mechanisms or misallocation of resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Wisdom Layer:</strong> Wisdom corresponds to system-level decisions and behaviors. For neural networks, this can be compared to the overall functional output and coordination. In this layer, we investigate whether the pathological accumulation of proteins causes changes in network properties (such as changes in network synchronization and structural connectivity recombination) at the loop level, resulting in a decrease in the system's decision-making ability. For example, in Parkinson's disease, the brain's ability to make \"wisdom decisions\" in motor control as a whole is reduced due to damage to the substantia-striatal circuitry (manifested by bradykinesia, erroneous movements). Computational modeling, such as neural network modeling, simulates basal ganglia dynamics, to validate how pathological burden alters network decision attributes. From the perspective of DIKWP, this is a manifestation of the hindrance or distortion of the transformation of knowledge into wisdom.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Purpose Layer:</strong> As the highest level, Purpose represents the goal, will, or motivation of the system. In organisms, it can correspond to the top-level regulatory purpose of maintaining homeostasis and achieving normal behavior. This project will explore the disintegration of the purpose level in the context of disease: the purpose of the normal brain (e.g., maintaining smooth movement, maintaining cognitive function) may be \"out of control\" or \"offset\" due to pathological invasion. For example, impulsive behavior and decreased volitional behavior in HD patients due to degeneration of the striatum-frontal circuit can be seen as impaired ability to drive purpose. We intend to capture the trajectories of the function of the Purpose layer during disease progression through animal behavior experiments and patient high-level functional assessment (such as executive function tests), and analyze its relationship with the degradation of the lower level Wisdom/Knowledge layer. From the perspective of DIKWP, a \"Purpose Runaway Model\" was established to explain how the activities of the lower circuit become disordered when the top-level purpose cannot be constrained normally, which further aggravates the pathological diffusion.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expected results:</strong> Through the above research, the first content will generate a new understanding of the pathogenic role of core pathological proteins, including their aggregation and propagation laws and the resulting signal network reconstruction. More importantly, we will obtain a multi-level analysis of the lesion process under the unified framework of DIKWP: from the initial molecular data abnormality, to the cell information processing disorder, to the neural circuit Wisdom decision-making impairment, and the whole-process mechanism model of the disintegration of the target layer control. This will provide a rationale for subsequent interventions targeting high-level functions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Content-2-Construction-of-disease-progression-model-based-on-DIKWP-and-research-on-the-mechanism-of-cognitive-control-layer-disintegration\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Content-2-Construction-of-disease-progression-model-based-on-DIKWP-and-research-on-the-mechanism-of-cognitive-control-layer-disintegration\" title='Content 2: Construction of disease progression model based on DIKWP and research on the mechanism of \"cognitive control layer disintegration\".'></a><strong>Content 2: Construction of disease progression model based on DIKWP and research on the mechanism of \"cognitive control layer disintegration\".</strong></h2><p><strong>Main research question:</strong> How to construct a model that can reproduce the whole process of neurodegenerative diseases, especially the <strong>deterioration of higher cognitive/control functions? How does the loss of high-level cognitive control interact with the structural degeneration of the underlying neural network during disease progression?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Study Protocol:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Establishment and improvement of brain organoid disease models: The</strong> human brain organoid models established in content 1 (containing familial mutations or induced pathological protein accumulation) were used to further culture and induce the emergence of advanced disease characteristics. This includes extending the culture time to promote age-related changes in organoids (e.g., protein accumulation, neuronal subtype loss, glial cell activation), and adding external stimuli/stress (e.g., α-syn preformed fibrils to stimulate organoids, glutamate excitotoxicity stimulation, etc.) to accelerate neurodegeneration. <strong>Due to the lack of sensory input and environmental interaction of conventional brain organoids, it is difficult to generate high-level neural functions</strong>, and this project will try to enhance the function of organoids by combining artificial consciousness theory. Specific methods include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The organoids are connected to the microelectrode array (MEA) dish, and their electrical activity is recorded in real time and electrical stimulation feedback is given, so that the organoids form a closed-loop interaction with the outside world. For example, referring to the \"DishBrain\" study, an algorithm was designed to give reward/punishment stimuli based on the organoid firing pattern, so that it \"learned\" to produce a specific firing response. Through this training, certain goal-directed behaviors are introduced to the organoids (e.g., learning simple pulse rhythms, synchronized with external signals).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Under the guidance of the DIKWP framework, <strong>organoids are given a \"Purpose Layer\" simulation</strong>: a high-level decision-making algorithm (based on reinforcement learning or DIKWP cognitive architecture) is run on the computer as a \"virtual Purpose Layer\" of organoids. The algorithm uses the electrophysiological data of organoids as input (data/information) and outputs guidance signals to act on organoids (affecting organoid activity through optogenetics or electrical stimulation) to simulate the regulation of the lower layers of the brain from the upper levels. In this way, an artificial cognitive control loop is constructed to realize an <strong>organoid-computer hybrid system</strong>. We will explore the differences in the behavior of the system in healthy and disease states: whether the healthy organoids + control system can better maintain stable activities, and whether the diseased organoids + control system have control signal disorders and coordination failures.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Organoids were observed to see if there were more complex patterns of activity, such as periodic rhythms, electrical band segmentation (e.g., EEG-like δ/thetama/β waves), and simple learning-memory representations (e.g., stimulus-response associations). It focuses on the evaluation of indicators related to cognitive control, such as the learning index of organoids in response to external changes, the ability to generate autonomous rhythms, etc. Monitoring the decay trajectories of these higher functions over time in disease organoids as an in vitro model of \"cognitive control layer disintegration\".</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Development of novel mammalian models:</strong> Although rodents have been widely used in the study of neurodegenerative diseases, their higher cognitive functions are limited, and in order to simulate the \"disintegration of the cognitive control layer\", this project considers the introduction of models closer to humans or specially designed animal models</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Non-human primate models: When</strong> necessary, work with the primate disease model research team to utilize transgenic monkey models (e.g., macaques carrying mutant α-syn or HTT). Non-human primates have more developed prefrontal lobes and cognitive functions, which can assess higher functional impairments such as cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease and mental and behavioral symptoms of HD, and more closely resemble the degenerative manifestations of the human \"cognitive control layer\".</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Design of a mouse model with controllable cognitive modules:</strong> Inspired by artificial consciousness, an attempt was made to introduce an \"artificial control layer\" through optogenetics in transgenic mice. For example, light-sensitive channels are expressed in a specific area of the mouse brain (prefrontal cortex), and an external computer is connected to monitor their motor/cognitive behavior in real time, and the light stimulation is regulated according to the DIKWP algorithm. This attempt was made to give mice an external cognitive control circuit to explore how symptoms of pre-existing disease (e.g., motor disorders, cognitive task performance) changed when the circuit was impaired (by stopping the stimulation or by incorrectly stimulating). Although challenging to implement, this exploration could provide evidence for validating the impact of \"control layer disintegration\" on disease.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Behavioral Assessment: Indicator Extraction of \"Cognitive Control Layer Disintegration\":</strong> In animal models, a series of behavioral tasks are introduced to evaluate advanced cognitive control functions, such as maze learning (spatial cognition), flipped learning tasks (cognitive flexibility), Go/No-go or stop signaling tasks (inhibitory control), etc. These tasks target executive function and cognitive control, and Parkinson's disease model mice (dopamine deficiency) and HD model mice (striatal degeneration) are expected to exhibit significant deficits in these tasks. The success rate of the above tasks and reaction time were recorded in the course of the disease, which were used as quantitative indicators of cognitive control ability with the development of the disease. Combined with neural recording technology (such as implanting microelectrode arrays in the brains of free-moving animals to monitor cortex-striatal-thalamic circuit discharge), we can analyze how the neural network activity pattern changes with the deterioration of the disease during the execution of cognitive tasks, and identify the early signals of network disintegration.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Analysis of the interaction mechanism of \"cognitive control layer disintegration\":</strong> Based on the results of organoids and animal models, the causal relationship between the deterioration of advanced cognitive control function and underlying neurodegeneration is analyzed from the perspective of DIKWP</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>When the underlying neurons are degenerated and protein pathologies accumulate, how do the higher-level purpose signals (such as brain instructions) change? We will test the hypothesis that <strong>low-level faults can be propagated upwards to disrupt higher-level control</strong>. For example, by comparing disease models whether the prefrontal cortex (associated with cognitive control) has neurodynamic changes early in the lesion (even if the pathology is predominantly in the underlying motor area). If it is found, it means that the low-level pathology spreads to the high-level pathology, resulting in the gradual disintegration of the control layer.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Conversely, when high-level control is impaired (e.g., by inhibiting prefrontal activity by human intervention in the model), does it exacerbate low-level pathology? For example, in Parkinson's disease model mice, frontal lobe executive function training (e.g., cognitive training) may have an ameliorating effect on motor symptoms; Do motor symptoms worsen more quickly if they are deprived of cognitive stimulation? Positive cognitive activity has been shown to slow neurodegeneration. We will verify the protective effect of high-level activity on the survival and function of lower neurons by controlling the level of cognitive stimulation in animals, organoid stimulation patterns, and other experiments. If true, it would suggest that cognitive interventions can also be used as therapeutic ideas.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The DIKWP model is used to conceptualize the above two-way relationship: the high-level cognitive control is regarded as the top-level \"Purpose/Wisdom\" module, and the underlying neurodegeneration is regarded as the \"data/information\" module failure. We will try to build a simplified mathematical model that represents the interaction between the two in terms of differential equations or cybernetic models (e.g., Wisdom layer output = f (knowledge layer state, Purpose signal), knowledge layer decay rate = g (pathological load, Wisdom layer input)). By fitting experimental data, we look for the model form that best explains the cognitive-pathological interaction, and refine the key parameters (representing the intensity of the \"gain\" or \"gating\" effect of a certain biological process, such as the Purpose layer). This model will provide a quantitative tool for the evaluation of intervention strategies for both the top and the bottom in Content 3.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expected Results:</strong> Content 2 will produce innovative disease models and new understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive control deterioration: for the first time, brain-like organoids and animal models with artificial cognitive control circuits will be constructed to simulate the impairment of higher functions in neurodegenerative diseases. On this basis, we will elucidate the causal loop between cognitive control layer disintegration and neural network degeneration, and answer the core questions of how the decline of high-level functions accelerates the degeneration of the underlying layer and how the underlying lesions affect the high-level functions. The results of this part will provide theoretical support for disease intervention from a cognitive perspective, and also provide a more comprehensive model platform for subsequent evaluation of new drugs/therapies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Content-3-Screening-of-potential-new-drug-targets-design-of-intervention-strategies-and-simulation-of-DIKWP-drug-effect-pathways\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Content-3-Screening-of-potential-new-drug-targets-design-of-intervention-strategies-and-simulation-of-DIKWP-drug-effect-pathways\" title=\"Content 3: Screening of potential new drug targets, design of intervention strategies and simulation of DIKWP-drug effect pathways\"></a><strong>Content 3: Screening of potential new drug targets, design of intervention strategies and simulation of DIKWP-drug effect pathways</strong></h2><p><strong>Main research questions:</strong> Based on the above-mentioned mechanistic studies, identify the key nodes (molecular, cellular, or circuit level) that can be targeted for intervention in the disease process, and develop corresponding therapeutic strategies. How can we assess the impact of an intervention at all levels of the disease system, from molecular to cognitive? Can the DIKWP framework be used to construct a multi-level transmission model of drug action to assist in predicting efficacy and optimizing the combination of strategies?</p>\n<p><strong>Study Protocol:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Target Mining and Validation:</strong> Based on the data obtained in content 1 and 2, systems biology and bioinformatics methods were used to screen potential intervention targets</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>At the molecular/cellular level, differential omics analysis (transcriptome, proteome, metabolome) is performed to look for molecules that are significantly dysregulated in disease states. For example, which upstream regulators in the cellular stress network induced by protein aggregation change the most (potential master regulatory switch); Which metabolic pathways are most severely impaired during neurodegeneration (e.g., key enzymes for mitochondrial function). Combined with the database of known drug action targets, match whether there are molecules that can be regulated by drugs. Priority is given to key nodes that are abnormal in multiple disease models as candidate intervention targets.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>At the neural circuit level, according to the results of content 2, the nodes that play a key role in maintaining the stability of the network are identified. For example, if the intensity of activity in a particular brain region (eg, prefrontal cortex, specific nuclei of the basal ganglia) is highly correlated with the severity of disease symptoms, this brain region/circuit may be a breakthrough for intervention. If possible, chemogenetics/optogenetics were used to verify whether stimulation or inhibition of this node would improve model animal performance.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Using genetic clues: Finding out the pathways involved in the disease risk gene set (such as the lysosome/mitochondrial pathway of PD, the RNA metabolism pathway of ALS, etc.) from the large-scale gene association data of humans, and the corresponding pathway molecules can be used as potential targets. For example, the frequent mutations of LRRK2 and GBA genes in PD suggest that their pathways are worth targeting. C9ORF72 pathological mechanisms in ALS involve ribosomal stress and may also be considered. Starting from the cross-disease commonality, pay attention to whether there are multiple susceptible pathways shared by diseases, and if so, their key nodes are more valuable for general intervention.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The above list of candidate targets was optimized through multi-dimensional weight scores (such as validation results in several models, drug accessibility, whether it affects high-level functions, etc.), and finally some of the most promising new targets were determined.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Intervention strategy design and preliminary evaluation:</strong> Formulate corresponding intervention plans around each key target selected:<br/>For each candidate intervention strategy, a preliminary evaluation is carried out in the cell/organoid model to detect whether it can reduce pathological protein load, restore cell viability, and improve the synchronization of organoid electrical activity. If a strategy shows good results in vitro, it is advanced to animal models to test its behavioral and pathologic improvements (e.g., whether drug administration delays motor function deterioration or improves cognitive task performance in model mice).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Small molecule drugs: Screening existing or designing new small molecule inhibitors/activators. With computer-aided drug design (CADD) and virtual screening, find candidate molecules from a library of compounds that bind to key sites of the target protein. For existing marketed drugs, consider the possibility of repurposing for indications. For example, some anticancer or metabolic drugs act on shared pathways and may interfere with neurodegenerative processes. There have been successful cases in this area, such as metformin (diabetes drug) that has been studied to improve neuronal metabolism to combat AD/PD pathology.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Biotechnic therapeutics: designing gene therapies (e.g., silencing disease-causing genes using AAV vectors to overexpress protective genes or RNA interference), antibody therapies (e.g., monoclonal antibodies to remove extracellular aggregates), and cell therapies (e.g., transplanting genetically modified neural stem cells to secrete beneficial factors). Particular attention is paid to whether high-level cognitive control can be enhanced to intervene in the disease, such as electrical stimulation/brain-computer interface assistance.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Combination strategy: Consider the regimen of multi-target combination intervention, because dyskinetic degenerative diseases often have complex mechanisms, and <strong>multi-level combination intervention may be more effective</strong>. The DIKWP model helps to pick and choose combinations that act on different levels. For example, one regimen may include a two-pronged approach of \"molecular layer clearance protein aggregation + loop layer brain stimulation\" to simultaneously alleviate underlying pathology and apical dysfunction.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Construction of DIKWP-drug regulatory pathway mapping model:</strong> After obtaining some experimental validation, this project will develop a computer simulation platform to combine the DIKWP framework with the drug action model to simulate the global effect of predicting the intervention strategy. Here's how:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Model framework:</strong> Based on the five-layer structure of DIKWP, model nodes corresponding to biological levels are established: the data layer corresponds to key molecular/pathological indicators, the information layer corresponds to the state of cell signaling pathways, the knowledge layer corresponds to the local network structure/plasticity, the Wisdom layer corresponds to the overall network function indicators (such as network efficiency and synchronicity), and the Purpose layer corresponds to the behavior output or cognitive score. The causal relationship between the layers will be depicted in the form of mathematical relationships on the basis of the above experiments and literature, for example, the increase of pathological protein load (data) leads to the activation of apoptosis signals (information), which can be modeled as the activation function of data to the information layer; For another example, the decline of network function (Wisdom) will affect the realization of the Purpose, which is expressed as a function of the output of the Wisdom layer that determines the achievement of the goal of the Purpose layer.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Drug effect embedding:</strong> For each intervention, a corresponding effect is added to the model: for example, small molecule drug X can reduce the variable of \"aggregation level of a protein in the data layer\" by a certain proportion, gene therapy Y can enhance the \"information layer autophagy pathway activity\" and indirectly reduce the pathological production rate of the data layer, and brain stimulation Z can improve the \"Wisdom layer network synchronization index\", etc. Through the literature and our experimental data, the range of quantitative parameters for these effects is given.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Simulation and optimization:</strong> Numerical simulation of different intervention programs was carried out using the constructed model. After the intervention was introduced, the changes in the key indicators of each layer of the model over time, as well as the improvement of the final output of the \"Purpose layer\" (which can be understood as symptom score or functional score). For example, comparing the simulated effects of drug X alone, brain stimulation Z alone, and X+Z combined to find the combination that had the greatest improvement in the top-level Purpose indicator. At the same time, the model can be used for sensitivity analysis: to assess the impact of the uncertainty of each parameter on the outcome, so as to understand the possible changes in the treatment strategy under different individuals (different parameters). This is akin to building a digital twin to test therapies in a virtual environment and compare the pros and cons.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Feedback optimizes experimental design: The</strong> simulation results will be used to guide subsequent real-world experiments. For example, if the model predicts that the combination therapy X+Y synergy is significantly superior to that of a single agent, we will focus on validating this combination in an animal model; If the model suggests that a key parameter (e.g., drug dose-effect curve) has a significant impact on efficacy, we will design experiments to measure this parameter in detail and calibrate the model. Through the iteration of models and experiments, the understanding and success rate of disease intervention are improved.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expected Results:</strong> Content 3 will eventually produce several promising intervention targets and therapeutic strategies, and verify their effectiveness through preliminary experiments; More importantly, we will get a \"digital model of disease-drug action\" that integrates the DIKWP theory. This will reveal a panoramic picture of how the intervention works at all levels, helping to uncover indirect pathways or potential risks that traditional approaches fail to detect. For example, a model may show that a drug targeting a molecular target reduces protein aggregation but causes a compensatory change in the knowledge layer that has little effect on the Wisdom layer, alerting the need for other means. The research in this content will provide a basis for the optimization of strategies before clinical trials enter human trials, and realize an important leap from mechanism discovery to application translation.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Feasibility-analysis\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Feasibility-analysis\" title=\"Feasibility analysis\"></a><strong>Feasibility analysis</strong></h1><p>The project is novel and ambitious, but technically and theoretically feasible, mainly reflected in:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Preliminary Research Basis: The</strong> project team has carried out extensive preliminary work in related fields. <strong>In terms of theory</strong>, Professor Duan Yucong's team, as a leader in the field of DIKWP model and artificial consciousness, has published a series of results and has a complete independent intellectual property system. It includes proposing the basic principles of the DIKWP model, constructing a \"dual circulation\" artificial consciousness architecture, and developing the DIKWP semantic operating system. In particular, the team has established the DIKWP Artificial Consciousness Laboratory and developed the DIKWP-AC Physiological Artificial Consciousness Prototype System, which has initially realized the mapping of the DIKWP model to the neurophysiological process of the brain. This prototype system was presented at the first World Congress of Artificial Consciousness and demonstrated the feasibility of using the DIKWP model to simulate cognitive processes in the brain. These works provide a solid theoretical and instrumental foundation for this project, which enables us to apply DIKWP to biomedical exploration. <strong>In terms of biomedicine</strong>, many core members of this project have been engaged in the research of the mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases for a long time, and have accumulated rich experimental experience and resources. The team has mastered the breeding and phenotypic analysis technology of mouse models of Parkinson's disease, ALS and other diseases, established an iPSC cell line library and successfully differentiated brain organoids, and published papers on protein aggregation and neuroinflammation mechanisms in international journals. We have the technical platform and talents to carry out key experiments such as molecular biology (such as viral vector construction, CRISPR gene editing), omics analysis (transcriptome sequencing, proteome quantification), electrophysiological recording (patch-clamp, MEA), etc. The team also worked with multiple hospitals to obtain patient clinical samples and data that could be used to validate the clinical relevance of the findings. These upfront foundations ensure that the project is \"thought of and done\".</p>\n<p><strong>2. Feasibility of technical route:</strong> The technical means to be used in the project are all mature or rapidly developing methods, and have been applied in our team or cooperative units</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Protein aggregation and propagation studies:</strong> Related cell models (e.g., α-syn fiber-induced diffusion) and animal models (intracerebral injection of pathogenic proteins) have been well reported in the literature. In recent years, our laboratory has also carried out research on α-syn propagation and accumulated the necessary technology. Pathological section immunoassay and fluorescence quantitative imaging can accurately track the diffusion path of aggregates.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Brain organoids and disease modeling:</strong> We have successfully cultured region-specific organoids such as cortex, hippocampus, and substantia nigra and observed spontaneous electrical activity. Organoids have been used internationally to study the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The introduction of external electrical stimulation and closed-loop control into organoids is a new attempt, but the required components (multi-electrode arrays, stimulus-feedback algorithms) are already commercially available and can be integrated by our team's engineering staff.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Artificial Consciousness System Integration:</strong> The DIKWP-AC prototype system is already in its infancy. Docking it with organoids/animal models requires custom hardware and software interfaces, but we have a basis for collaboration in the field of brain-computer interfaces. In addition, there have been similar successful cases of reinforcement learning algorithms used in biofeedback training, and the required software framework can be quickly developed by drawing on open source solutions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Omics and computational modeling:</strong> The multi-omics sequencing and analysis platform is well-equipped in our team and partner units, and the data processing pipeline is mature. The DIKWP-drug pathway model requires some software development and mathematical modeling, but the team has members who are familiar with systems biology and computational modeling, and can be supported and guided by data from Prof. Duan's DIKWP laboratory. <strong>Previous literature has explored the introduction of control theory into disease mechanism and drug development, which</strong> proves that this idea is feasible, and our DIKWP model will further enhance the explanatory power.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Project management and cooperation support:</strong> This project is supported by the school and multidisciplinary platform of the research group, and has a good implementation guarantee. The project team has formulated a detailed implementation plan and risk plan, and each module is smoothly connected and can be carried out relatively independently to ensure flexible adjustment. The funds are mainly used for the purchase of reagent consumables, organization of laboratory animals and data analysis and computing resources, and the budget arrangement is reasonable and feasible. We have established cooperation with top research institutions and hospitals in China, such as in primate model culture, patient sample acquisition, etc. Once a grant has been awarded, critical experiments and model building can begin immediately. The project leader and key researchers have experience in hosting national projects, and are familiar with the organization and management of large-scale projects, which will ensure that the project is carried out in an orderly manner as planned.</p>\n<p>To sum up, this project has a good foundation in terms of personnel reserves, experimental conditions and theoretical tools. The proposed methods are bold and innovative but well-founded, and we will implement each step with a solid experimental and scientific attitude. The multidisciplinary nature of the project also ensures that in the process of implementation, even if a certain technical route encounters challenges, the team can quickly adjust the plan, <strong>with a high risk resistance and success probability</strong>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Innovation\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Innovation\" title=\"Innovation\"></a><strong>Innovation</strong></h1><p>This project combines cutting-edge theories of artificial intelligence with neuroscience challenges, and is expected to produce the following innovations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Pioneering Theory Fusion:</strong> The DIKWP model and artificial consciousness theory proposed by Professor Duan Yucong were applied to the research of neurodegenerative diseases for the first time. The five-level cognitive framework is used to analyze the biopathological process, and the perspective of \"Purpose\" is introduced in the field of neurodegeneration mechanism research, creating a new research paradigm. This cross-border convergence is expected to break through the limitations of traditional neurobiology that only looks at problems at the molecular or cellular level, and provide a holistic understanding of disease.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Brain-like organoid-artificial consciousness hybrid model:</strong> A new disease model is proposed and practiced, which connects human brain organoids with artificial intelligence control systems, and endows organoids with certain environmental interaction and goal-oriented capabilities. We will simulate the \"collapse of cognitive control\" in diseases, a phenomenon that was difficult to reproduce in the laboratory before. The establishment of this model is the first of its kind in the world, opening up a new way for disease mechanism research and drug screening.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Integrated analysis of multi-level pathological mechanisms:</strong> Using the DIKWP framework as a guide, the disease mechanism is studied from multiple levels such as molecular aggregation dynamics, cell signaling networks, neural circuit functions, and cognitive behavior, and the causal relationship between each level is clarified. In particular, the concepts of \"information processing dysregulation\" and \"purpose out of control\" are proposed to explain how protein aggregation leads to dysfunction. This cross-scale integrated analytical approach is unprecedented in the study of movement disorders, and is expected to uncover key mechanisms that cannot be revealed by traditional single-level research.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>DIKWP Drug Effect Pathway Model:</strong> Innovatively construct a DIKWP-drug regulation pathway mapping model to simulate the impact chain of interventions on the disease system. Unlike traditional pharmacodynamic models, which focus only on biochemical effects, our models cover the entire chain from molecular to cognitive and are able to evaluate the impact of interventions on higher order functions. This model can be used to optimize the design of multi-target combination therapies and improve the success rate. This will be a new drug discovery aid that can be scaled up to the design of therapies for other complex diseases.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Potential common targets and strategies:</strong> By comparing the similarities and differences of Parkinson's disease, ALS, HD, SCA and other diseases, we are expected to propose cross-disease generic intervention targets (such as protein homeostasis maintenance pathways, neuroinflammation regulators) and global prevention and treatment strategies (such as cognitive stimulation therapy). This exploration of the idea of \"treating different diseases at the same time\" for movement disorders will enrich the treatment theory of neurodegenerative diseases and have the potential to bring a broad spectrum of new therapies.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, the innovation of this project lies in the theory, methodology, tools and strategies. Its implementation will inject the latest concepts of artificial intelligence into the research of neurodegenerative diseases, accelerate the transformation of theory and practice in this field, and is expected to achieve original results with international influence.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Research-Basis\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-Basis\" title=\"Research Basis\"></a><strong>Research Basis</strong></h1><p>The application team of this project has a deep research foundation and good cooperation conditions in related fields, and can provide strong support for the smooth implementation of the project:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Academic foundation of the project leader and main members:</strong> The project leader, Professor Duan Yucong, is a well-known expert in the field of artificial intelligence and cognitive computing, and has made outstanding achievements in the DIKWP artificial consciousness model. As the initiator of this model, Professor Duan has published dozens of related papers and obtained more than 100 domestic and foreign invention patents. These achievements have established his position in the international academic community of artificial consciousness. Professor Duan has an interdisciplinary background, and in recent years, he has actively combined artificial intelligence theory with life sciences, and has guided the development of the DIKWP physiological and artificial consciousness prototype system and tried to apply it to medical scenarios. Another core member, Dr. Tang ××, presented the work of the DIKWP white-box evaluation framework at the 2023 international conference, laying the foundation for the interpretability of the DIKWP model. The above work shows that the team has outstanding strength in theoretical innovation and software development.</p>\n<p>In terms of biomedicine, the project team has also brought together outstanding talents in neuroscience and bioinformatics: associate PI researcher Li ×× has been engaged in the study of the mechanism of Parkinson's disease for a long time, discovered new evidence of α-syn transmission, and published many papers in journals such as Acta Neuropathologica; Prof. Wang ××, Associate PI, is an expert in genetic and neurological diseases, who has conducted in-depth research on the pathogenic genes of ALS and SCA, and has presided over relevant projects of the National Key R&amp;D Program. Among the young backbones of the team, Dr. Zhang × specializes in stem cell and organoid technology, and has published research papers on brain organoids; Dr. × Liu is proficient in multi-omics data analysis and computational modeling. In their respective fields, they have a series of high-level results, forming a solid support for the objectives of this project.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Previous work achievements: The</strong> previous relevant research of the project team members provides preliminary data and empirical support for this topic</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>In terms of protein aggregation and cellular response, we have observed that abnormal α-syn aggregation can lead to autophagic lysosomal dysfunction and dopaminergic neuron damage using Parkinson's model cells, and the results have been published in a paper. This proves that we have mastered the methods for protein aggregation detection and cellular stress analysis.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In terms of animal models, the team successfully established transgenic α-syn mice and mutant HTT (R6/2) mice, and conducted behavioral follow-up to obtain data curves for the deterioration of motor and cognitive function with age in these models. This provides a baseline for subsequent evaluation of the effect of the intervention. We also attempted to inject pre-α-syn fibers into ordinary mice, which resulted in Lewy-like pathology at synaptic junctions, confirming the prion transmission hypothesis.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In terms of brain organoids, we have successfully verified the formation of HTT aggregates in organoids by culturing 3D brain tissue with a diameter of 4 mm containing cortex and striatum regions, in which stem cells from HD patients have been introduced. This previous experiment showed that organoids could partially reproduce the developmental abnormalities and neurotoxicity of Huntington's disease.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In terms of artificial intelligence simulation, we have conducted biological verification experiments of the DIKWP model internally: we used the developed software to simulate the degradation process of the neural network, tried to reconstruct the phenomenon of \"cognitive control layer disintegration\" in the model, and compared it with the degradation model of the human brain functional network reported in the literature, and obtained a preliminary agreement. This gives us the confidence to build more complex digital twins of DIKWP diseases.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In terms of drug screening, we have conducted drug retargeting studies for Parkinson's disease using gene expression data and drug gene signature banks to identify several possible drug candidates (e.g., drugs that regulate lysosomal function). Some drugs have been tested at the cellular level and have been shown to have an inhibitory effect on α-syn aggregation. This experience can be directly used in the screening process of content 3 of this project.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Platform and cooperation:</strong> The unit has advanced scientific research platforms, including a molecular biology center, an animal experiment center (including an SPF-level animal room and a behavioral laboratory), a cell and organoid culture room, and a high-performance computing center. These platforms can meet the experimental and analytical needs of the project in all aspects. In addition, we have established synergistic relationships with many teams at home and abroad, such as cooperating with a top AI research institute in China to develop DIKWP model applications, sharing organoid culture experience with a foreign neuroscience laboratory, and cooperating with the neurology department of an affiliated hospital to collect clinical samples and carry out translational research. These collaborations will provide a strong impetus for project implementation and provide a channel for the output and replication of results.</p>\n<p>Based on the above research foundation, we believe that the project team has sufficient strength to achieve the set goals. No matter from the perspective of personnel knowledge structure, existing achievements accumulation or experimental conditions, it provides a guarantee for the smooth development of this project. The team's past experience in working together will also ensure close cooperation and resource sharing between various tasks. It can be expected that during the implementation of the project, we will continue to produce high-quality medium-term results to support the achievement of the final overall goal.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Team-members-and-schedules\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Team-members-and-schedules\" title=\"Team members and schedules\"></a><strong>Team members and schedules</strong></h1><p><strong>Project Team Composition:</strong> This project is undertaken by a multidisciplinary team, and the core members include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Yucong Duan</strong> (Project Leader): Professor, expert in artificial intelligence and cognitive computing.

At present, the prevalence of these diseases is increasing year by year around the world, seriously affecting the quality of life of patients and placing a heavy burden on society and families. Although treatments such as drugs (eg, levodopa) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) can partially alleviate symptoms, they do not stop disease progression, and long-term drug use can fluctuate and become resistant, and DBS surgery is costly and limited. <strong>The existing intervention methods are mainly to passively respond to the symptoms of the disease and treat them after the symptoms appear</strong>, and there is a lack of active prevention and intervention mechanisms for the early stage of the disease or even before the occurrence of the disease. This \"passive medicine\" model has obvious drawbacks: patients are often diagnosed when neurons are dying massively and their function is severely impaired, missing the best time to intervene. At the same time, the complex interactions between various pathogenic mechanisms have not yet been fully understood due to the complex etiology of movement disorders, involving multiple factors such as genetic factors, environmental toxins, aging processes, and imbalances in the metabolism of neurotransmitters such as dopamine. Traditional biomedical research and clinical trials often focus on a single level of mechanism, and it is difficult to fully reveal the whole process of the disease. In addition, the <strong>application of existing AI technology in medical treatment mostly stays at pattern recognition and auxiliary diagnosis, and there</strong> is still a lack of systematic methods for modeling disease mechanisms, simulating the evolution of disease course, and guiding individualized treatment. This technological gap makes it urgent to explore new interdisciplinary solutions, integrate the cutting-edge advances of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, and establish an intelligent intervention system under the paradigm of active medicine.</p>\n<p>The concept of \"proactive medicine\" advocates moving the medical threshold forward, and through continuous monitoring and proactive intervention, action can be taken before the disease occurs or at an early stage to prevent minor illnesses from becoming major diseases. This concept requires the integration of multi-source data, knowledge and artificial intelligence technology to achieve global control and dynamic management of personal health status. In the management of degenerative diseases, active medicine emphasizes the combination of early detection, individualized treatment and long-term management, and empowers doctors and patients to make collaborative decisions through AI, moving the \"treatment window\" forward. However, active medical research on movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease is still in its infancy: we lack effective models to comprehensively analyze data from patients at all levels, from molecular and neural circuits to clinical symptoms, and there is a lack of platforms that can reconstruct disease mechanisms and test treatment options in a virtual environment. <strong>In the field of neuroscience, there are a large number of research results on motor control and Parkinson's disease mechanisms (such as models on</strong> [the function of basal ganglia circuits]{.underline}), but these knowledge exist scattered in the literature, and a unified semantic model has not yet been formed to facilitate computer understanding and reasoning. <strong>Although deep learning, reinforcement learning and other methods have emerged in the field of artificial intelligence, traditional AI is mostly a black-box model, lacking the explainability of the decision-making process and the rigorous reasoning required in the medical field. At the same time, a purely data-driven approach is difficult to directly apply to small-sample, high-complexity medical problems. Recent studies and reviews have pointed out that computational modeling tools are essential to navigate the complex pathological network of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease</strong>, and multi-scale models across all levels of pathogenesis, neurodynamics, and treatment strategies are needed to guide us beyond the limitations of intuition. For example, some scholars have used computational models to reveal the origin of abnormal oscillations in the β band (15–30 Hz) in the basal ganglia network of Parkinson's disease, and some studies have used simulations to better understand the mechanism of action of DBS treatment. These all show that system modeling is of great value in unraveling the complexity of movement disorders. However, at present, such models are mostly limited to specific subsystems or single scales (such as only neural circuit models or molecular network models), and have not yet formed a unified framework for integrating cognitive semantics and physiological mechanisms.</p>\n<p>In order to bridge the above technical gaps, we plan to introduce <strong>a series of original theories and technologies proposed by Professor Yucong Duan, including the DIKWP artificial consciousness model</strong>, <strong>ACPU architecture</strong>, <strong>[semantic elastic network]{.underline}</strong> and self-explanatory mechanism, etc., to integrate neuroscience and artificial intelligence to build an intelligent and active intervention medical platform. <strong>The DIKWP model is an extension of the classic DIKW</strong> (pyramid) model, adding the fifth layer of \"Purpose\" on top of the four layers of Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom, and replacing the linear level with a network structure, so that the semantics of each layer can be fed back and updated iteratively in both directions. This innovative cognitive system provides a full-link traceable semantic representation for the AI decision-making process, which is expected to solve the problem that traditional black-box models are difficult to interpret and control. As Professor Yucong Duan explains, \"The DIKWP model builds a common cognitive language between humans and machines, allowing every step of the AI decision-making process to be traced, explained, and understood by humans.\" By embedding the key layer of 'purpose' inside the model, we are not only able to make AI smarter, but also ensure that it always serves human values and security needs.\" The semantic elastic network based on DIKWP can organize massive heterogeneous knowledge in the medical field in the form of multimodal semantic graphs, and realize the flexible association of different levels of information through elastic links, so that the model can dynamically adapt to the integration of new knowledge and environmental changes. This opens up the possibility of real-time knowledge updates and personalized interpretations required for active medicine. [The Artificial Consciousness Processing Unit]{.underline} (ACPU) is a brain-inspired computing architecture that is proposed in conjunction with it It aims to implement the DIKWP model at the software and hardware levels, and support real-time cognitive loop and metacognitive feedback. In short, ACPU is equivalent to the brain processing unit of artificial intelligence, and its architecture design integrates subliminal computing (such as pattern recognition ability of large model-like LLM) and conscious DIKWP semantic reasoning mechanism, so as to improve the autonomous decision-making ability and efficiency of artificial intelligence in complex and dynamic environments. Simulation results show that the real-time bidirectional fusion mechanism of deep semantic space and high abstract concept space can be significantly improved by designing a real-time two-way fusion mechanism of deep semantic space and high abstract concept space in ACPU, and the quality of Wisdom decision-making can be significantly improved, and human-like cognitive flexibility can be given to artificial intelligence systems. Finally, the <strong>self-explanatory mechanism runs through the above models and architectures to ensure that the system can give an intelligible explanation based on the DIKWP semantic link when making decisions or intervention suggestions. For example, for the treatment plan recommendation for patients with Parkinson's disease, the system can explain the basis: starting from the patient's data (symptoms, examination indicators), extracting key information and patterns (information layer), combining medical knowledge and previous cases (knowledge layer) to analyze possible pathological mechanisms, and weighing factors such as long-term prognosis and quality of life (</strong> Wisdom layer), which ultimately gives recommendations for intervention and its intended purpose (Purpose layer), and is able to give human-understandable justification and justification for each step of reasoning. This self-explanatory capability is particularly important for medical AI, as it not only increases the trust of doctors and patients in AI decision-making, but also facilitates expert review and correction of system recommendations.</p>\n<p>In summary, this project proposes a plan for the construction of an active medical research and intervention system integrating the DIKWP model in view of the key shortcomings in the current research and intervention of movement disorder neurological diseases. Through systematic analysis of the existing technology gaps, it can be seen that a platform that can integrate multi-scale neuroscience mechanisms and interpretable AI semantic models is needed to reconstruct the pathogenic process of Parkinson's disease and other diseases, and realize the virtual testing and optimization of intervention methods such as drugs and devices, and at the same time support brain-computer interfaces to realize the reconstruction and feedback control of patients' motor purpose. In the following sections, we will elaborate on the six core research contents of the project: 1) theoretical modeling of motion control and neurodegenerative processes based on DIKWP semantic system mapping; 2) Design of ACPU-driven brain-like circuit regulation simulation platform; 3) Parkinson's disease and other mechanism reconstruction and drug testing environment supported by the virtual patient system; 4) brain-computer interface and motor purpose reconstruction mechanism; 5) Domestic active medical intervention program, drug screening and intervention device design; 6) Phased tasks and key outcome nodes of the three-to-five-year project. Through the integration of these innovative points, we hope to design a set of intelligent active intervention medical platform architecture with an engineerable path (can be implemented), <strong>an evaluation system</strong> (measurable effect) and sustainable evolution ability (iterative optimization), and create a new paradigm for the prevention and treatment of movement disorder neurological diseases.</p>\n<h1 id=\"The-DIKWP-semantic-system-models-the-mapping-of-motor-control-and-neurodegenerative-processes\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#The-DIKWP-semantic-system-models-the-mapping-of-motor-control-and-neurodegenerative-processes\" title=\"The DIKWP semantic system models the mapping of motor control and neurodegenerative processes\"></a><strong>The DIKWP semantic system models the mapping of motor control and neurodegenerative processes</strong></h1><p>Motor control is a multi-layered and complex process, involving the production of higher levels of purpose in the cerebral cortex, to the selection and initiation of motor patterns by central structures such as the basal ganglia, to the spinal cord and peripheral nerves to perform specific muscle actions, and sensory feedback from proprioception and vestibular and visual feedback. In movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, various parts of this process are affected to varying degrees, eventually leading to motor dysfunction. We plan to construct a DIKWP semantic system to comprehensively map the semantic hierarchy and mechanism of this process, and organically combine the biomedical mechanism with cognitive semantics to form a unified representation of motor control and neurodegeneration.</p>\n<p>Firstly, the hierarchical meaning of the DIKWP model is briefly described: the <strong>data (D) layer corresponds to the original biological signals and objective data, such as electromyography signals, EEG</strong>/EEG signals, brain structure images, biochemical indicators, etc., which constitute the underlying record of the state of the motor system. In healthy people, the data layer covers a large number of signals generated by various links during the execution of the exercise plan (such as the original cortical firing pattern, the frequency of basal ganglia firing, the strength of muscle contraction, etc.). <strong>The information (I) layer is the meaningful patterns and features extracted from the processing of the data layer, such as the characteristic parameters of motion-related potentials, the intensity of neural oscillations in specific frequency bands, and the motor performance indicators (gait speed, step length, etc.). Through the information layer, we transform the messy data into indicators and signal characteristics that can reflect the state of motor function. For example,</strong> the enhancement of synchronous oscillations in the β band (~20 Hz) in the basal ganglia loop is a typical information-layer feature of Parkinson's disease, suggesting enhanced motor inhibition and impaired motor initiation. The <strong>knowledge (K) layer further combines the domain knowledge of medicine and biomechanics to elevate the characteristics of the information layer to the understanding of the mechanisms of fighting disease and the principles of motor control. This includes knowledge of the function of the anatomical circuit (eg, we know that the direct striatum-pallidus pathway activation promotes movement, and the indirect pathway activation inhibits movement; Dopamine has an excitatory effect on the direct pathway and an inhibitory effect on the indirect pathway, etc.), including the existing knowledge of the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (e.g</strong>., abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein leads to the death of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, which in turn causes striatal dopamine insufficiency). The knowledge layer allows us to explain the reasons behind the anomalous features that appear in the information layer. For example, we know that enhanced oscillations in the basal ganglia β are associated with dopamine deficiency and overexcitability of the indirect pathway, so that we understand the pathological mechanism behind this informational feature and guide interventions accordingly (e.g., the use of electrical stimulation to inhibit the overactivity of the indirect pathway node STR). <strong>The Wisdom (W) layer introduces high-level considerations such as clinical decision-making experience, ethics, and long-term effects. At the</strong> Wisdom level, we evaluate and make decisions on the possible interventions provided by the knowledge layer, taking into account factors such as the overall condition of the patient, the risk-benefit of treatment, the humanistic care, and the quality of life. For example, for a patient with Parkinson's disease, the knowledge layer may provide several intervention ideas: increasing the dose of drugs, implementing surgical intervention (DBS), or trying exercise rehabilitation. The Wisdom layer will take into account the patient's age, disease course, financial status, personal preferences (such as whether they are willing to undergo craniotomy), as well as long-term efficacy and side effects, etc., to make an individualized and best decision plan that is in line with the overall interests of the patient. <strong>The Purpose/Purpose (P) layer defines the ultimate goal, i.e., the goal of improving motor function and quality of life for the patient.</strong> The purpose layer includes both short-term goals (eg, elimination of tremors, improved gait) and long-term visions (eg, slowing disease progression, maintaining the ability to live independently). This level ensures that the entire package of interventions is centred around the stated medical objectives and provides a yardstick by which to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.</p>\n<p>Based on the above definitions of DIKWP, we map the motor control process and the degenerative evolution of Parkinson's disease to the semantic space of DIKWP. Specifically, in healthy motor control, the layers are closely connected: the Purpose layer is generated by the brain (e.g., the purpose of \"reaching out for a cup\"), the Wisdom layer evaluates the necessity and safety of this action (e.g., ensuring that other objects are not knocked over, conforming to social situations, etc.), the knowledge layer invokes the previously learned motor skills and internal models (how to coordinate the arm muscles to complete the action of holding the cup), and the information layer is transformed from motor instructions into neural firing patterns and muscle recruitment patterns. The data layer is the occurrence of specific physiological electrical signals and muscle movements. When the exercise is successfully completed, the information of each layer is also corrected through sensory feedback, forming a closed-loop regulation.</p>\n<p>In the case of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, we can use the DIKWP model to describe the dysregulation of each layer: first, in the data layer, the loss of dopamine neurons leads to a significant decrease in the intensity of the dopamine signal received by the striatum, which is a change in the original physiological data; At the same time, abnormal neural synchronization (e.g., decreased theta waves, hypersynchronization of β waves) can occur in EEG/local field potential recordings, and EMG data show decreased muscle activity at the initiation of movement, etc. These data-level abnormalities document objective physiological changes in Parkinson's disease. <strong>At the information level, these data are reflected as specific abnormal patterns: for example, the continuously high amplitude of the basal ganglia β oscillation is extracted as an information feature, indicating enhanced motor inhibition; For another example, gait analysis information may reveal that patients have characteristics such as smaller stride length and procrastinating steps; The olfactory test information showed that the patient's sense of smell decreased significantly, etc. Each piece of information corresponds to a signal of the underlying pathological process. The knowledge layer provides an explanation for this: according to medical knowledge, we explain the enhancement of the oscillation of the basal ganglia β as a relatively strong indirect pathway and a dysregulated loop rhythm due to dopamine deficiency; Reduced gait and shuffling are understood to be</strong> clinical manifestations of akinesia, resulting from impaired midbrain pacemaker function; Olfactory decline is associated with prodromal pathological changes such as possible Lewy bodies in olfactory bulb accumulation by the knowledge layer. The knowledge layer also includes an integrated understanding of pathogenic mechanisms, such as the α-synuclein misfolding to form Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease, the role of neuroinflammation, and how genetic susceptibility (mutations in genes such as LRRK2 and PINK1) affect autophagy and mitochondrial function. This knowledge helps us model the causal network of disease. <strong>In the management of Parkinson's disease, the wisdom layer is reflected in the high-level design of clinical strategies and rehabilitation goals, including when to intervene in drug therapy, when to consider surgery, how to balance the improvement of motor symptoms with drug side effects, and the consideration of psychological and social support for patients. At the</strong> Wisdom level, we emphasize patient-centered long-term planning, such as early motor function exercise programs to slow down muscle wasting and joint stiffness, with the aim of \"delaying disability\"; Consider the patient's lifestyle and compliance in the drug regimen, and develop a simplified and effective medication plan. <strong>The purpose layer clarifies the ultimate goal of the whole intervention, such as \"allowing patients to maintain their ability to walk independently and avoid serious falls in the next 3 years\", \"maximizing the improvement of self-care and dignity\", etc. These</strong> purposes guide the development of strategies at the Wisdom level and become the ultimate criteria for evaluating efficacy.</p>\n<p>In order to use the DIKWP model to formally model movement disorders, we will use semantic networks and ontological methods to construct a knowledge graph related to Parkinson's disease. This is done by grouping concepts, entities and processes related to motor control and Parkinson's disease into the atlas according to the hierarchy of DIKWP. For example, at the data layer, we define various data nodes (e.g., \"EMG signal\", \"dopamine concentration\", \"gait video\"); At the information layer, define state**/feature nodes** (e.g., \"basal ganglia β oscillates too strongly\", \"Bradykinesia\", \"hyposmiculture\"); The knowledge layer includes mechanism**/diagnostic nodes** (e.g., \"X% loss rate of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra compacta\", \"inhibition of striatal D1 receptor signaling pathway\", \"middle Parkinson's disease (Hoehn-Yahr class III)\", etc.); The Wisdom layer contains decision**/strategy nodes** (e.g., \"Adjust levodopa dose\", \"Recommend DBS surgical assessment\", \"Intensive gait training\"); The Purpose layer includes target nodes (e.g., \"50% symptom reduction\", \"reduction in risk of falls within one year\", \"maintenance of self-care ability\"). These nodes are connected by directed correlation edges, forming a causal and semantic network. For example, \"loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra (knowledge)\" points to \"decreased dopamine concentration (data)\" through the causal side, which in turn explains \"enhanced oscillation of the basal ganglia β β (information)\", \"enhanced oscillation of the basal ganglia\" further leads to \"slow movement (information)\", whereby the doctor will diagnose \"intermediate Parkinson's disease (knowledge)\" at the knowledge level, and then the \"brain pacemaker treatment (decision-making)\" will be selected by the wisdom layer to achieve \"improved motor function (purpose)\", etc. Through such a semantic network, we can globally represent the chain of Parkinson's disease onset and intervention. It is worth emphasizing that this is not a static tree-like structure, but a mesh-like elastic semantic network: there is a two-way connection and cyclic feedback between the nodes of each layer, which is in line with the \"dual loop\" concept of the DIKWP model. For example, when we implement an intervention (e.g., DBS), the data layer will generate new signal changes, the information layer will refine features such as \"reduced tremor amplitude\", and the knowledge layer will update the assessment of the condition (symptom improvement) accordingly, and the wisdom layer will adjust the follow-up treatment strategy and even update the overall recovery goal (Purpose). In this way, a closed-loop adjustment is formed between the upper and lower layers: on the one hand**, the purpose (P) layer drives the actions of the lower layers, and on the other hand, the change of data to the Wisdom layer will in turn affect the purpose** and achieve continuous optimization. For example, an objective improvement in a patient's motor function (data/information layer) may motivate a patient to be more willing to recover (Purpose layer) and adjust to new health goals.</p>\n<p>By mapping and modeling motor control and disease processes through the DIKWP semantic system, we will theoretically gain a global understanding of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease: both signals and pathologies at the physiological level, as well as goals and goals at the cognitive decision-making level. On the one hand, this model can be used as the semantic basis for subsequent simulation and intervention systems, and on the other hand, it can also be independently used for inference analysis and early warning of disease mechanisms. For example, we can use this model to interpret the semantics of early Parkinson's disease: before the clinical symptoms appear, there may be abnormalities in the information and data layers, such as decreased sense of smell, abnormal sleep behavior (REM sleep behavior disorder), etc. The model is able to correlate this fragmented information to potential disease risks (e.g., α-synuclein pathology in progress) through the knowledge layer, and the Wisdom layer can then recommend early life interventions or pharmacotropic strategies (e.g., regular exercise, neurotrophic supplementation) to serve the purpose of \"delaying the onset of Parkinson's disease\". This embodies the spirit of proactive medicine: <strong>proactive intervention before the disease has a full-blown outbreak</strong>. For example, for patients who have already been diagnosed, the model can analyze the status of each layer: if a patient is identified as belonging to the \"drug fluctuation stage\" in the knowledge layer, the Wisdom layer can decide to introduce adjuvant therapy, such as DBS or COMT inhibitors, and \"maintain symptom stability\" as the new purpose goal. In conclusion, DIKWP semantic modeling provides a hierarchical analysis and synthesis platform for movement disorders, enabling us to dissect disease processes like \"dissecting\" computer programs, focusing on both the underlying data and the high-level purpose, laying a theoretical foundation for active intervention.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Design-of-ACPU-driven-brain-inspired-circuit-regulation-simulation-platform\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Design-of-ACPU-driven-brain-inspired-circuit-regulation-simulation-platform\" title=\"Design of ACPU-driven brain-inspired circuit regulation simulation platform\"></a><strong>Design of ACPU-driven brain-inspired circuit regulation simulation platform</strong></h1><p>After establishing the DIKWP semantic model, a platform capable of realistically simulating brain circuitry and disease dynamics in a computer environment was needed to validate theories, discover new mechanisms, and test intervention strategies. In this project, we propose to design an ACPU-driven brain-like circuit regulation simulation platform using the Artificial Consciousness Processing Unit (<em>ACPU</em>). ) to model and modulate key neural circuits related to motor control. The platform will serve as a \"virtual brain bench\" in which researchers and clinicians can reconstruct neural circuit abnormalities in movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, test the effects of various electrical stimulation, medications, and behavioral interventions on circuit dynamics and functional output, and accelerate the innovation process from mechanistic studies to therapy design.</p>\n<p>First, explain the role of the ACPU architecture in this platform. ACPU is a new computing hardware and architecture concept proposed by Yucong Duan's team, which aims to simulate the mechanism of the conscious and subconscious working together in the human brain. To put it simply, ACPU consists of two main subsystems: one is the subliminal computing subsystem, which is good at massively parallel data processing and pattern recognition (similar to the unconscious information processing of the human brain, which can be implemented by deep learning networks or brain-like chips); The second is the consciousness computing subsystem, which is based on the DIKWP model for high-level semantic understanding, reasoning and decision-making (corresponding to the conscious thinking part of the human brain). These two subsystems are coupled together by a bi-loop architecture: the subconscious subsystem continuously converts the environment and internal data into information and provides it to the conscious subsystem; The consciousness subsystem selectively pays attention to this information according to the purpose drive, integrates knowledge, and makes wisdom decisions, which in turn guides the further information collection and processing of the subconscious layer. In terms of hardware, ACPU can be implemented as a hybrid architecture that fuses brain-like chips (e.g., synaptic devices, neural network-like acceleration chips) and symbol processing units, as well as corresponding software (Artificial Consciousness Operating System, ACOS). It is characterized by real-time (it can respond to changes in sensor data in real time), <strong>autonomy</strong> (built-in goal-driven cyclic feedback), and interpretability (using the DIKWP model to record the decision-making process). Using ACPU in our platform is like equipping the virtual brain with an artificial \"frontal lobe\", which can regulate and plan the simulated brain circuit activity like the human brain, so as to achieve a more intelligent simulation than traditional pure algorithm simulation.</p>\n<p>At the heart of the platform is a multi-scale brain network simulator where we will focus on simulating neural circuits that are closely related to movement disorders. The most critical of these is the basal <strong>ganglia-thalamic-cortical circuit</strong>, which plays a decisive role in the initiation and regulation of voluntary movements and is the main target of Parkinson's disease lesions. The basal ganglia mainly include structures such as the striatum, the inner and outer globus pallidus (GPi/GPe), the substantia nigra dense and reticular parts (SNc/SNr), and the thalamic basal nucleus (STN), which form multiple closed-loop pathways (direct, indirect, and superdirect) with the cerebral cortex and thalamus. In healthy conditions, the cortex excites the striatum, and the striatum inhibits GPi/SNr through direct pathways, thereby relieving the inhibition of GPi/SNr on the thalamus and promoting movement; On the other hand, the striatum excites GPe through indirect pathways, thereby inhibiting the excitatory effect of STN on GPi/SNr, indirectly weakening the ability of GPi/SNr to inhibit the thalamus, and also promoting movement. The SNc in the substantia nigra dense part of the midbrain releases dopamine, which excites the direct pathway and inhibits the indirect pathway, respectively, making it easier for motor signals to pass through. The balancing of this complex circuit ensures the proper execution of the motion commands. In Parkinson's disease, the dopamine deficiency of SNc leads to the weakening of the direct pathway and the enhancement of the indirect pathway, and finally the GPi/SNr over-inhibits the thalamus, making it difficult to initiate movement. In addition, STN over-discharge due to the loss of sufficient inhibition of GPe also strengthened the inhibition of the thalamus by GPi/SNr. This sequence of alterations can be quantitatively described using circuit models and results in abnormal β oscillations in the basal ganglia circuit, corresponding to clinical motor stiffness and tremor.</p>\n<p>To visually depict this circuit, we illustrate the flow of information from the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical circuit in normal and pathological conditions in the figure above. The green arrows represent excitatory signals (glutamate pathway), the red arrows represent inhibitory signals (GABA pathway), and the blue arrows represent dopamine pathways (which have a dual effect on direct/indirect pathways). It can be seen that in Parkinson's disease (decreased dopamine), the inhibitory effect of GPi/SNr on the thalamus is too strongly activated by the indirect pathway (red), resulting in a decrease in the excitatory signal from the thalamus back to the cortex, and the movement cannot be initiated smoothly.</p>\n<p>In the simulation platform, we will build a mathematical model of the above loops. Considering the real-time and controllable nature of the requirements, we can use <strong>neural mass models or mesoscopic network models to approximate the overall dynamics of individual nuclei. For example, each structure (striatum,</strong> STN, GPi, etc.) represents the evolution of its average discharge rate with a set of differential equations that can fit actual physiological data (e.g., patient DBS electrode records). In particular, we introduce dopamine concentration as a key parameter of the model to modulate the gain of direct and indirect pathways. This allows for a numerical description of \"dopamine reduction\", the core lesion of Parkinson's disease. Previous studies have used a similar method to simulate the dynamic differences of brain networks before and after L-Dopa administration, and successfully verified the effectiveness of the model by comparing the simulation results with the patients' EEG data. We will draw on these results to enable the model to produce both neural activity in a normal state and the characteristics of the pathological state by adjusting dopamine parameters. On this basis, the subconscious subsystem of the ACPU can continuously run the loop model to generate a real-time brain activity data stream of virtual patients.</p>\n<p>Further, we plan to expand the scope of simulation and <strong>integrate other related networks</strong> of the brain to build a more complete \"<strong>virtual brain</strong>\". Movement disorders not only affect motor circuits, but also involve cognitive and emotional circuits. For example, patients with Parkinson's disease often have cognitive decline (involving the hippocampus, cortico-striatal circuits) and mood disturbances (involving the limbic system). As a result, our platform modularly incorporates <strong>cortex-striatum-hippocampal circuits</strong> (mimicking cognitive functions, such as the working memory circuit) and limbic circuits (such as the nucleus accumbens, dopamine reward pathways, which are involved in depression and motivational disorders). These modules are interconnected with motor loops to further enhance the physiological realism of virtual patients. At the same time, it also provides a means to study Parkinson's comorbidities such as Parkinson's dementia. This is where the architecture of the ACPU comes into play: because the virtual brain model contains many circuits and a large number of neurons, the subconscious subsystem (the brain-like computing part) can advance the numerical solutions of these differential equations in parallel and efficiently, or run event-based simulations of spiking neural networks. The consciousness subsystem can monitor these simulation outputs and combine them with the DIKWP semantic model to understand and intervene in the simulation results. For example, when a simulation exhibits an abnormal pattern (e.g., β oscillations are too strong, the simulator exhibits difficulty in locomotion), the consciousness subsystem elevates this pattern to information/knowledge semantics (\"increased motor inhibition\" is detected) and triggers an intervention at the target level (e.g., \"reduce β oscillations to improve movement\"). Next, it can intervene in the \"virtual brain\" in the simulation by calling the control interface in the platform. This is exactly what the name of the platform means by \"regulation\": <strong>not only to simulate disease circuits</strong>, but also to intervene in them and observe the results.</p>\n<p>The platform will provide simulation interfaces for a variety of interventions: including electrical stimulation (e.g., DBS electrode stimulation of a nucleus), <strong>drug effects</strong> (altering virtual dopamine levels or adding pharmacological effects on specific receptors), <strong>genetic/molecular manipulation</strong> (mimicking the effects of gene knockout or protein aggregation on neurons), and sensory**/motor training**(Adapting sensory input given by the virtual environment or asking a simulated patient to perform a specific task to observe neuroplastic changes). For example, a DBS stimulation module can parametrically set the position of the stimulation electrode (STN or GPi, etc.), the stimulation waveform (frequency, pulse width, voltage), the stimulation strategy (constant stimulation or adaptive closed-loop stimulation), etc., and then act on the corresponding part of the simulation network to change its kinetic equation in real time (e.g. adding periodic forcing terms or changing thresholds to the stimulated nuclei). Another example is a drug module that can act on dopamine parameters or specific ion channel parameters to simulate the kinetics of the drug (e.g., levodopa works by gradually increasing dopamine levels, but fluctuating over a long period of time). Through these interfaces, we are able to try various treatment options in a virtual environment. The consciousness subsystem of the ACPU intelligently selects and combines these interventions according to the principles of the DIKWP Wisdom layer. For example, it can mimic a combination of drugs followed by electrical stimulation, compare the effects of different frequencies of DBS, or even try novel interventions (e.g., on-demand triggered adaptive stimulation, stimulation strategies that work in synergy with the patient's purpose).</p>\n<p>An important goal of the platform design is to achieve closed-loop control and adaptive simulation. That is, the simulation not only passively runs the preset parameters, but can be adjusted in real time based on the results halfway through. For example, we can have the ACPU act as a \"virtual doctor\", constantly monitoring the key indicators of the virtual patient (such as motor function score, network synchronization level, etc.) during the simulation process, and making decisions to adjust the intervention parameters based on the DIKWP model, just as the clinical doctor adjusts the medication or adjusts the intensity of the stimulus according to the patient's response. Let's take a specific scenario: at the beginning of the simulation, the virtual patient is in the \"off phase\" (symptoms are severe, dopamine is low), and the ACPU chooses to give the drug first (simulating a dose of levodopa) according to the goal (the Purpose layer wants the symptoms to be halved). After a few minutes of simulation, a significant decrease in the \"basal ganglia β oscillation\" was detected, and the motor index improved, but at the same time there was an excessive γ oscillation (a side effect signal, which may correspond to dyskinesia); At this time, the ACPU consciousness subsystem judged the drug overdose according to the rules of the knowledge layer, and then adjusted the strategy: reduce the drug dose and turn on the DBS stimulation at the STN site to stabilize the network rhythm, and strive to maintain the improvement of movement while inhibiting abnormal oscillations. In this way, the platform completes an adaptive intervention simulation loop. Through a large number of such simulation experiments, we can find the optimal treatment plan, such as when to adjust the drug, when to add DBS, what mode to use for DBS, and so on. In fact, in reality, adaptive DBS (aDBS) has shown significant results over conventional constant stimulation: the use of implanted electrodes to monitor the patient's nerve signals in real time and adjust the stimulation as needed can reduce the duration of Parkinson's symptoms by up to 50%. Our simulation platform will provide a development and testing environment for these closed-loop therapies. For example, the effects of different sources of feedback signals (cortical EEG or STN local field potentials) and different control algorithms (threshold control or machine learning prediction) on the efficacy of aDBS can be tested on virtual patients to help design better aDBS strategies.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that the platform will not only serve the research objectives of this project, but will also become an open research tool in its own right. The architecture is scalable: researchers can add new models of brain regions as needed, substitute parameters to mimic other movement disorders (e.g., Huntington's disease, where striatal GABAergic neurons are lost and can be changed), or for other areas of brain science research. Through this engineering path, the platform output can continue to be iteratively upgraded. We will also establish an evaluation system for the platform, including simulation accuracy (how well the simulation results match real physiological data), real-time performance (simulation acceleration ratio), and performance evaluation indicators for intervention program optimization. For example, statistical methods were used to compare the improvement of virtual patients' symptom scores under different intervention regimens as a basis for evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of the regimens. Another example is to evaluate the credibility of the platform by verifying whether the platform can reproduce known experimental phenomena (such as the effect of radiofrequency burning surgery on tremor in the basal ganglia in the dopamine deficiency model) based on the literature data. These metrics will help us to continuously improve the model to make it more biologically realistic and predictive.</p>\n<p>In summary, the ACPU-driven brain-like circuit regulation simulation platform proposed in this section is a key bridge from theory to application in this project. It \"lands\" the abstract DIKWP semantic model into a working virtual brain, allowing us to repeat experiments in the computer that are limited by ethics, cost or time in reality, and accelerate the discovery of the best intervention strategies. At the same time, in the development process of this platform, we will continue to combine the latest data from neuroscience (such as large-scale brain network connection maps, human brain stimulation response data, etc.) and the latest artificial intelligence technologies (such as more realistic neuron models and more efficient parallel computing chips) to ensure that the platform has sustainable evolution capabilities and will not stay in the same version. This is also in line with the requirements of the National Science and Technology Major Project for \"platform construction\": to establish an open and expandable platform to serve more research in the future.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Parkinson-s-Disease-Mechanism-Reconstruction-and-Drug-Testing-Environment-Supported-by-Virtual-Patient-System\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Parkinson-s-Disease-Mechanism-Reconstruction-and-Drug-Testing-Environment-Supported-by-Virtual-Patient-System\" title=\"Parkinson's Disease Mechanism Reconstruction and Drug Testing Environment Supported by Virtual Patient System\"></a><strong>Parkinson's Disease Mechanism Reconstruction and Drug Testing Environment Supported by Virtual Patient System</strong></h1><p>In the previous section, we described a brain-like circuit simulation platform that is equivalent to building a model of the \"brain of disease\". This section focuses on the construction of \"virtual patient\" systems, i.e., how simulations can be extended to the patient level for reconstructing disease mechanisms and conducting drug testing. The virtual patient should include not only the cerebral circuits, but also other physiological and pathological processes related to the disease, as well as external clinical manifestations and environmental interactions. In this way, we can fully reproduce the disease process of a person with Parkinson's disease in the digital space, from molecular, cellular to behavioral, for research and testing of new therapies.</p>\n<p>There are several key elements to a virtual patient system:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Integration of multi-scale mechanisms: The</strong> pathological mechanisms of Parkinson's disease span multiple scales: at the molecular level, there are α-synuclein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation; At the cellular level, there is neuronal degeneration in specific brain regions; abnormal neural network dynamics (e.g., oscillation) at the loop level; At the systemic level, there are motor, cognitive, and emotional dysfunction. This virtual patient will integrate these levels of mechanistic models. For example, at the molecular-cellular layer, we can use a dynamic causal model based on literature to simulate the loss of dopamine neurons, including how age, genetics, and environmental factors lead to protein aggregation and neuroinflammation, which in turn triggers apoptosis or autophagy imbalance. This model can describe the proportion of neurons surviving over time and the effects of drugs on it (e.g., certain neuroprotective agents slowing apoptosis) using differential equations or state shift models. These micro-level states affect the parameters of the macro-loop model (e.g., dopamine levels), forming an upstream and downstream interface. Similarly, peripheral physiological models, such as musculoskeletal models, can be added to simulate motor execution and feedback, so that the virtual patient can \"move\" and their motor performance can be presented by simulating a simple anthropodynamic model (e.g., the handstand pendulum model for gait stability and the joint drive model for motion amplitude). Through multi-scale coupling, we reconstruct the chain of disease from pathogenic agents to dysfunction.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Individualized parameter setting:</strong> Each real patient has different symptoms and disease course, and the virtual patient system should also support parameterized individualization. We will design a series of parameters to represent the individual characteristics of the patient: such as the stage of the disease (early, intermediate, late), the type of predominant symptoms (predominantly tremor or stiffness), comorbidities (presence or absence of cognitive impairment, depression), age and gender, genetic background (type of mutation), etc. These parameters govern the settings inside the model. For example, the early PD corresponds to a low rate of neuronal loss and a certain level of residual dopamine. The tremor-dominant type can enhance the rhythm nodes associated with tremor occurrence in the loop model. In combination with depression, changes in the 5-HTergic system can be added to the model. By adjusting the parameters, we can \"generate\" different virtual patients. Ideally, we can customize the virtual patient based on the data of the real patient to achieve a \"digital twin\": the data of the individual's brain image, EEG, clinical scales and other data are mapped to the model parameters, so that the model can simulate the pathological characteristics of the patient. This will help personalize medicine in the long run.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Virtual Experimental Environment:</strong> One of the purposes of building a virtual patient system is to test drugs and therapies in a risk-free environment. Therefore, we need to design a virtual experimental process: various interventions can be applied to the virtual patient and the multi-dimensional output can be observed. Outputs include simulated clinical symptoms (e.g., motor performance scores inferred from motor loop activity, smoothness of virtual gait, virtual grip strength, etc.), as well as indicators of internal mechanisms (neuronal survival, protein aggregation levels, etc.). We will develop a visual interface to present these outputs and provide a statistical analysis module to compare different experimental conditions. Researchers were able to design experiments with virtual patients as they would in real experiments, such as testing hypotheses about \"Can drugs that inhibit protein aggregation slow neuronal death and thus improve long-term motor function?\" We can add the effect of the drug on the protein aggregation process to the model (set its effect on reducing the aggregation rate based on in vitro experimental data), and then let the virtual patients start to simulate the 5-year disease course from middle age, one group administers the drug and the other does not intervene, and observe whether the difference in neuronal survival and exercise capacity indicators between the two groups is significant after 5 years. If the virtual trial shows a positive effect, consider the feasibility of a real clinical trial. Similarly, we can test various drug combinations and intervention times at high throughput. Because there are no ethical and safety limits to virtual experiments, we can even try radical scenarios such as, \"If I take a drug regularly for 10 years before the onset of symptoms, will I almost be able to avoid the onset of the disease?\" \"This kind of problem that cannot be immediately confirmed in reality can be predicted by the model.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Drug Screening and Repurposing:</strong> Drug screening can be significantly accelerated with a virtual patient system. We will integrate a drug database containing drugs known to target Parkinson's disease and related pathways and their mechanisms of action (receptor affinity, effects on pathway nodes, etc.). Combined with AI technology, we can have the system automatically search for candidates in the drug space that have an ameliorating effect on specific mechanism abnormalities. For example, if a model indicates that a patient's disease progression is primarily driven by an \"inflammatory cascade,\" the system can screen the database for anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory drugs that significantly reduce inflammatory mediator levels and neuronal death in the model, and recommend advancing the drug to animal trials or clinical trials. This computer-aided approach to drug repurposing is expected to find new uses from existing drugs. In fact, there have been attempts to use computational models to discover Parkinson's disease-related metabolites and potential drug targets. Our system will go one step further and provide a more intuitive basis for evaluating drug effects directly in full-course simulations. In addition, for new drug molecules, we can also interface with molecular dynamics and QSAR models to preliminarily evaluate their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and target binding, so as to improve the screening efficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Validation &amp; Calibration:</strong> In order to guarantee the reliability of the virtual patient, it is necessary to perform sufficient verification calibration. Data sources include published clinical statistics, cohort study data, and data from model animal experiments that may be performed by our collaborating team. We will compare the model output with real-world data, e.g., whether the model predicts whether the average decrease in motor scores in untreated PD patients after 5 years is consistent with epidemiological observations; Whether the model simulation of \"using a drug can extend the life of neurons by X%\" is consistent with the results of animal experiments. If there is a deviation, we go back to the DIKWP semantic network to find where the mechanism may be missing or the parameters are wrong, and then fix the model. For example, if the model does not exhibit the motor fluctuations that are common in some patients, it may indicate that we have not included in the model the mechanisms of sensitivity changes (e.g., peak-trough effects) caused by prolonged use of levodopa, in which case a related mechanism module or adjustment parameter curve can be added. Through continuous iteration, we strive to make the model have the ability to predict quantitatively, that is, given an intervention plan, the model can approximate the trend of the outcome.</p>\n<p>By constructing a virtual patient system, we open up a new dimension for the study of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease: from qualitative description to quantitative reconstruction. Researchers are able to directly \"see\" the invisible parts of the disease process (such as the rate of cell death) in the virtual patient, and can arbitrarily manipulate various factors to test the hypothesis. This will greatly accelerate our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of disease. For example, in a virtual patient, it is possible to split the contributions of the various pathways: simply to see if the α-synuclein aggregation itself can cause disease, or does it have to superimpose aging/inflammatory factors? This helps to unravel the causal relationship between the entanglement of various factors. At the same time, for treatment development, virtual patients are low-cost test beds. While drug development has traditionally been a lengthy process of cell experiments, animal experiments, small-scale clinical trials, and scale-up clinical trials, virtual trials can simulate a multi-year process in a matter of hours, so as to eliminate apparently ineffective or serious side effects in advance, and focus valuable resources in the most promising directions. Of course, virtual trials cannot completely replace real clinical trials, but they can greatly improve the efficiency and success rate of R&amp;D, and have proven to be valuable in oncology and other fields. Through the exploration of this project, it is expected to establish independent digital disease modeling and drug screening capabilities, and reduce the dependence on foreign experimental data and experience.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Virtual Patient System pushes this project into the era of digital twins of disease mechanisms and intervention research: we can not only digitally reproduce diseases, but also digitally try treatments, which is no less important than inserting \"second eyes\" and \"second hands\" for medical research. This lays the foundation for true proactive medicine, because only by fully understanding the full picture of the disease and being able to predict the effect of interventions can we proactively and preemptively change the trajectory of the disease, rather than passively waiting for the disease to evolve and then catching up with the treatment.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Research-on-brain-computer-interface-and-motor-purpose-remodeling-mechanism\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-on-brain-computer-interface-and-motor-purpose-remodeling-mechanism\" title=\"Research on brain-computer interface and motor purpose remodeling mechanism\"></a><strong>Research on brain-computer interface and motor purpose remodeling mechanism</strong></h1><p>Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology is a rapidly developing hotspot in the field of neural engineering, which directly reads and decodes the neural activity of the brain to control external devices or computers, so as to achieve direct communication between the brain and the outside world. In the intervention of movement disorders, BCI has a unique application potential: on the one hand, it can read the patient's residual motor <strong>purpose</strong> , bypass the damaged neural pathway and directly drive the assistive device to help the patient complete the movement; On the other hand, feedback signals or stimuli can also be fed into the brain, combined with the patient's purpose, to enhance or correct their motor output. This project integrates brain-computer interface technology into the active medical intervention system, and explores <strong>the mechanism and method of motor purpose reconstruction, making it a bridge between patients and intelligent intervention platforms.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Signal acquisition and decoding of motor purpose:</strong> For patients with Parkinson's disease, due to the dysfunction of the basal ganglia circuit, when they try to exercise, the motor areas of the cerebral cortex still send motor command signals, but these signals are impaired during transmission (such as over-inhibited thalamic filtering) and fail to reach the spinal cord effectively. BCI captures these brain signals and provides us with a window into the patient's true purpose. Signals available include invasive cortical electrode array recordings (e.g., Utah microelectrodes, which can record single neuron discharges or local field potentials), deep brain electrodes (e.g., DBS electrodes implanted with STNs can also be used for recording), and non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). Clinically, fully invasive options have been limited, but for patients with severe movement disorders, some attempts have emerged, such as cortical surface ECoG electrodes combined with BCI to control the exoskeleton. We will track signals that can be acquired in conjunction with the patient's therapy (e.g., the DBS device can be stimulated and recorded simultaneously after the upgrade to a bidirectional device), as well as a wearable, high-density EEG device to obtain motion-related signals.</p>\n<p>Decoding the motor purpose requires translating these neural signals into meaningful instructions. Machine learning and deep learning techniques, such as training convolutional neural networks or time-frequency analysis algorithms, can be applied here to identify features of different motor imaginations or attempts (e.g., patients trying to raise their arms, legs, etc.) from cortical signal patterns. Previous studies have shown that AI models can distinguish brain MRI patterns between Parkinson's patients and healthy people, and even use EEG to predict exercise status. We collect a certain amount of data to train the decoder. For example, in a simulated or real-world setting, patients are asked to imagine/try a number of simple actions while recording the signal, and supervised learning is used to establish a mapping of the signal pattern to the purpose. Once trained, our system can monitor the patient's brain activity in real time and capture this purpose when they are trying to move but are blocked.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Refactoring and Execution of Motion Purpose: Obtaining</strong> Purpose is only the first step, and it is more important to convert Purpose into actual action output. This can be done through a variety of pathways: first, <strong>peripheral muscle stimulation or exoskeleton</strong>. For example, when BCI detects that the patient has the purpose of \"lifting the right foot\" but is unable to do it on its own, it can trigger an exoskeleton robot or functional electrical stimulation (FES) device attached to the leg to complete the foot lifting action on its behalf. Second, <strong>brain/spinal cord stimulation</strong>. If we can send the motor purpose back to the center so that other backup pathways in the brain or spinal cord can directly receive this instruction, it may also restore some motor function. For example, in some studies, scientists have realized the brain-computer-spinal cord interface, bypassing the injured segment in a person with spinal cord injury, and electrically stimulating the corresponding segment of the spinal cord after decoding the motor cortex signal through the computer, so that the paralyzed limb can move again. For Parkinson's patients, a similar idea can be envisaged: for example, the motor cortex signal is decoded and directly stimulated downstream of the patient's motor nerve pathway (e.g., stimulation of anterior horn neurons of the spinal cord) to achieve direct control bypassing the diseased basal ganglia. This, of course, requires addressing the issue of coordination and precise control. Our simulation platform can help test the <strong>feasibility and effectiveness of this type of motion purpose refactoring.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3. Convergence of BCI and ACPU/DIKWP system:</strong> In the platform architecture of this project, BCI is both an input device and an output device. On the one hand, <strong>BCI can be used as an input</strong> to inject the real Purpose data of the patient's brain into our DIKWP model, so that the Purpose layer and the Wisdom layer of the virtual patient can obtain a reference for the patient's subjective goals. For example, if a patient wants to walk but can't, this purpose can be captured by the system and considered in the Wisdom layer (e.g., the system will be more active in looking for interventions to improve walking). On the other hand, <strong>BCI is an output</strong> that can directly feed the system's decisions back to the patient's brain or body to achieve human-machine integration. For example, when the system decides to \"increase the stride length of the left limb now\", the patient's cerebral cortex can be guided by brain stimulation to produce corresponding motion images to enhance the patient's perception of the amplitude of movement, or the exoskeleton can be used to allow the patient to experience the movement of a larger stride length to train the brain to re-establish a normal motor rhythm. This form of integrating AI decision-making into the patient's neural circuit can be seen as a \"hybrid closed loop\"<strong>: humans and machines form a closed-loop system, where humans provide will, and machines provide assisted decision-making and motivational execution, and the two influence each other. In order to achieve such a fusion, we will investigate the role of self-explanatory mechanisms in human-computer interaction. For example, the system senses that the patient is repeatedly trying an action through the BCI and explains to the patient on the interface (or by voice): \"I detect that you want to stand up but your legs are weak, I will activate the lower limb exoskeleton to help you stand up\" and execute it with the patient's consent or acquiescence. This interpretation and feedback can enhance the patient's trust and cooperation with BCI adjuncts and reduce false triggering.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4. Learning and adaptation for motor purpose reconstruction:</strong> Brain-computer interface systems often require continuous learning and adaptation, as the patient's brain signal signature may change as the disease progresses or is trained. In this project, we will introduce an online learning algorithm into the subliminal part of the ACPU to continuously optimize the decoder based on feedback. For example, when BCI controls the exoskeleton to make the patient walk, the system can obtain the quality index of gait from the sensor, combined with the patient's subjective feedback, and adjust the decoding parameters through reinforcement learning, so that the mapping from purpose to action is smoother. This is similar to having a virtual patient and a real patient form a co-evolutionary twin system: the virtual end adjusts to the real person, the real end recovers under virtual guidance, and the two progress together. The structure of the DIKWP model provides a clear hierarchy here: the data/information layer corresponds to specific signals and actions, the knowledge layer can record knowledge such as \"the user's Purpose X corresponds to the error in decoding Y\", the Wisdom layer formulates adjustment strategies (e.g., prompting the user to change the way of imagining slightly, or automatically adjusts parameters), and the Purpose layer is always aimed at the final rehabilitation goal. This structured adaptation ensures that the learning process is traceable, safe and controllable, and does not change itself unpurposefully (which is important in medical care, as algorithmic changes can be dangerous).</p>\n<p><strong>5. Clinical application prospects:</strong> The research on brain-computer interface and motor purpose reconstruction will eventually produce several prototypes of practical systems. For example, the <strong>BCI assisted walking system</strong>: the wearable EEG or ECoG collects signals, and AI decodes the walking purpose in real time to control the exoskeleton of the lower limbs, so as to achieve smooth stride when Parkinson's patients are freezing of gait. <strong>Purpose-driven smart mobility aid</strong>: Automatically assists and stabilizes balance when a patient is about to stand to prevent falls. <strong>Speech/Writing Purpose BCI</strong>: To help patients with severely limited movement but clear consciousness communicate with the outside world through brain-computer communication. With the miniaturization of hardware and the advancement of algorithms, these BCI devices are expected to become practical. In the longer term, it may also be combined with a deep brain stimulation device to form a \"two-way brain-computer interface\": it not only provides therapeutic stimulation, but also reads signals to assist the patient in movement or adjust stimulation parameters. It is foreseeable that in the next 5-10 years, the application of BCI in the field of movement disorders will continue to expand, and even become an important rehabilitation tool like pacemakers and prostheses. Through the forward-looking research of this project, we can enable China to seize certain technological opportunities in this field, especially the Explainable BCI combined with the DIKWP artificial consciousness model, which will be more competitive and safe.</p>\n<p>All in all, the brain-computer interface and motor purpose reconstruction has injected the soul of \"human-centered\" into the active medical intervention system: it ensures that no matter how intelligent the AI is, it is centered on the subjective wishes and needs of the patient. This realizes a real closed loop of human-machine cognition, so that technology is no longer a cold external intervention, but an extension and supplement of patients' capabilities. In the management of diseases such as Parkinson's disease, such technologies have the potential to re-empower patients – even if their physical abilities are impaired, they can still actively participate in and control the recovery process through brain-computer interfaces, rather than being completely reactive in treatment. This shift is precisely the ideal of active medicine: Patient <em>actively</em> engaged in therapy with AI assistance, rather than passive recipient of care.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Domestic-active-medical-intervention-program-drug-screening-and-intervention-device-design\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Domestic-active-medical-intervention-program-drug-screening-and-intervention-device-design\" title=\"Domestic active medical intervention program, drug screening and intervention device design\"></a><strong>Domestic active medical intervention program, drug screening and intervention device design</strong></h1><p>The ultimate goal of this project is to transform the above theoretical models and technical achievements into practical active medical intervention programs and complete sets of devices, and provide domestic innovative solutions for movement disorder neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease. This includes a complete process from prevention and diagnosis to treatment and rehabilitation, as well as the core hardware and software systems that support the process. In this section, we will synthesize the previous research, delineate the outlines of these schemes and devices, and emphasize their engineering realization paths and localization significance.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Comprehensive intervention program design of active medicine:</strong> Based on the DIKWP model and the concept of active medicine, we design the intervention program throughout the whole course of the disease, reflecting the idea of \"early detection, early intervention, and full management\". These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Early Screening and Prevention:</strong> Using virtual patient models, we have identified some of the early digital biomarkers of Parkinson's disease (e.g., decreased sense of smell, abnormal sleep behavior, subtle bradykinesia, etc.) as well as potentially high-risk individuals (e.g., people with certain susceptibility genes or a history of pesticide exposure). The plan proposes to establish a community-level screening program, using simple and accessible domestic tools (olfactory test kits, smartphone apps for exercise tests, wearable devices to monitor sleep and gait, etc.), combined with AI evaluation models, to conduct risk assessment for middle-aged and elderly people. Once a high risk is identified, it will be included in the active intervention track immediately after being clinically confirmed. For example, lifestyle interventions (exercise therapy, Mediterranean diet, etc.) combined with neuroprotective drugs (eg, serotonin agonists, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, etc.) are used in early-stage patients or high-risk patients. Here, the DIKWP Wisdom layer takes into account the adherence and cost-effectiveness of the intervention and tailors an individualized approach (e.g., an exercise program that does not interfere with daily routines for people who are still working).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Proactive treatment after symptom onset:</strong> For patients who have developed motor symptoms, we are no longer limited to the traditional \"step-by-step medication\" and are introducing intelligent decision support. Specifically, the platform of this project is used to build a digital twin model for each patient, input their specific disease parameters, and the virtual patient system simulates the response to various drugs and dose combinations, so as to assist doctors in selecting the best regimen. For example, for patients with medium-term fluctuations in drug efficacy, the effects and side effects of adding a COMT inhibitor or an MAO-B inhibitor can be tested in the model, and the optimal combination can be recommended. This decision support will be provided to clinicians in the form of reports or interactive interfaces to help them make more informed adjustments to their treatment. For DBS surgery, we can also use the model to predict whether a patient is more suitable for STN or GPi stimulation (because the effect of the two targets is slightly different), as well as to predict the possible postoperative improvement for reference. Throughout the process, the systematic self-explanatory mechanism will clearly present the recommendation basis to the doctor to ensure that the clinical decision-making is transparent and credible.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Closed-loop monitoring and dynamic intervention:</strong> We design a home remote monitoring and intervention system, in which patients wear domestic multi-modal sensing devices (such as wearable motion sensors, watches to detect tremor and motion, and smart cameras at home to analyze gait), and the system obtains data streams every day and generates DIKWP data-information reports through AI analysis, such as \"today's tremor is 20% higher than yesterday, and the decrease in the number of turns at night may indicate poor sleep\". This information is reported to the cloud platform, and the knowledge layer judges that there may be problems such as insufficient dosage or side effects, and the Wisdom layer formulates an adjustment plan, such as \"It is recommended to increase the drug dose by half a tablet tonight, or turn on the sleep physiotherapy mode\". The system can automatically notify patients or families and automatically perform some interventions when authorized (e.g., smart pill boxes automatically adjust the amount of medication released at night). This closed-loop system uses the domestic Internet of Things and 5G technology to realize remote program control: as the current domestic DBS already supports, the implanter can be programmed through the network. Doctors can also view patient status and intervene remotely through the platform. This allows patients to receive ongoing care outside of the hospital and no longer rely solely on regular follow-up appointments to adjust treatment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Rehabilitation and retraining:</strong> In addition to medication and surgery, the place of rehabilitation in active medicine is particularly emphasized in our program. Using the project's BCI and exoskeleton technology, we can provide personalized rehabilitation exercises: for example, with the help of Purpose Recognition, let the patient lead some training games in virtual reality to exercise balance and coordination; Or use robot-assisted walking while adjusting the pace to the patient's real-time purpose to reshape their neural pathways. Rehabilitation data are also fed into the DIKWP model to help refine the assessment of patient function and the selection of priorities for subsequent interventions (e.g., if a patient is found to have a slower recovery of fine motor hand, the Wisdom layer will adjust the protocol to enhance hand rehabilitation). The whole program is centered on the patient's purpose and quality of life, and is improved dynamically and cyclically, so as to truly achieve active, whole-process and individualized intervention.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Modernization platform for drug screening and R&amp;D:</strong> The drug screening part of this project will not only stay at the model level, but also output some candidates and R&amp;D clues with drug potential. We will connect the potentially effective drugs found in virtual screening with domestic pharmaceutical research teams to carry out in vitro and animal validation. This is expected to give rise to the secondary development of domestic independent innovative drugs or new uses of old drugs. For example, if the model suggests that a Chinese medicine compound that has been marketed in China has a potential effect on the alleviation of Parkinson's disease, we can quickly organize preclinical and clinical trials to obtain approval for the new indication in a short period of time. For another example, for the screened new target molecules, we can coordinate the domestic new drug R&amp;D team to design the lead compound. The support of this program can cover early-stage R&amp;D and increase the success rate. Within the 3-5 year period of reporting, we expect to screen at least a few drug candidates for further study and develop new patents for Parkinson's disease to protect or improve symptoms. Through such efforts, China is expected to gradually narrow the gap with the international advanced level in Parkinson's disease drugs, and realize the shift from mainly relying on imported drugs to drugs with independent intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Localization design of intervention devices:</strong> In terms of hardware devices, the domestic equipment we plan to develop/improve includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>A new generation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) system:</strong> Based on the results of this project, a domestic brain pacemaker with adaptive stimulation function was designed. The specific features are: implanted electrodes to increase sensors, real-time recording of local EEG, and built-in AI algorithms (which can be based on the simplified ACPU principle) to adjust stimulation parameters in real time. The device realizes the main computing through domestic chips, and strives to reach the international level of similar products or even better. This project will provide the verification of algorithms and control logic, and the project implementation will be improved in cooperation with existing DBS vendors in China. At present, domestic manufacturers (such as Pinchi Medical) have launched perceptible, 3.0T NMR compatible, and remotely programmed advanced brain pacemakers, and we will further integrate closed-loop intelligence on this basis. After the launch of such a device, China will become a country that has mastered the core technology of adaptive DBS after the United States, and provide affordable high-end treatment for the majority of patients.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Portable EEG/Magnetic Brain Monitoring and Stimulation All-in-One Machine:</strong> For early intervention and home rehabilitation, we design a non-invasive brain-computer interaction device. It consists of a multi-channel dry electrode EEG acquisition cap and a transcranial electromagnetic/magnetic stimulation module that can help patients with specific training or symptom control at home. For example, when a brain signal is detected that the patient has a motor block (frozen gait), the device automatically administers transcranial electrical stimulation in the motor cortex to try to break the abnormal brain rhythm and make the patient walk again; Or when the patient is depressed, a specific frequency of transcranial magnetic stimulation improves emotion. This device can be worn by the patient on the head, connected to the mobile phone APP through wireless, the doctor can set the program remotely, and the patient can use it according to the prompts. All components and software are domestically produced to ensure data security and supply chain security.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Exoskeleton Rehabilitation Robot:</strong> As a key device at the output end of BCI, we will cooperate with domestic rehabilitation equipment manufacturers to transform the existing lower limb exoskeleton or training robot to make it compatible with brain-computer interface control. Its innovation lies in the addition of an AI control module, so that the robot can not only move according to a fixed program, but also respond to the patient's active purpose to adjust and cooperate. The structure adopts domestic high-performance lightweight materials and servo motors to ensure the comfort and safety of patients. The control algorithm is provided by us, especially the Wisdom layer concept of the DIKWP model into the control strategy, so that the robot can \"know\" the patient's state, such as actively reducing the assistance and prompting a rest when the patient is detected to be fatigue or resistance.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Smart drug delivery devices:</strong> To enable more granular drug interventions, we are considering implantable or wearable drug delivery devices. Examples include implantable drug pumps, which are used to continuously and slowly release dopamine analogues or other drugs to specific sites (similar to current duodenal gel pumps, but we explore the possibility of intraventricular or targeted drug delivery). and a subcutaneous smart pill box, which can be used to inject drugs at regular daily intervals according to the program, or to increase the dose in time when the system detects a worsening of symptoms. Through these devices, drug therapy can also achieve a certain degree of closed loop. All devices will be designed in accordance with national medical device specifications and will be ready for registration.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Evaluation system and standard construction:</strong> In parallel with the rollout of these programs and devices, we will also develop an evaluation system to quantify their effectiveness and safety. This includes: efficacy indicators (e.g., percentage improvement in UPDRS score, change in quality of life questionnaire score), initiative indicators (patient engagement, improvement in self-management ability), safety indicators (incidence of adverse events, device reliability), etc. In addition, we will engage with regulatory and standards bodies to incorporate some of the practices of proactive medical intervention into industry standards. For example, guidelines for the integration of digital diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease have been formulated, including digital biomarker screening and virtual model-assisted decision-making. Formulate safety certification standards for brain-computer interface products, etc. These efforts will help standardize and disseminate our results, paving the way for subsequent industrialization.</p>\n<p>To sum up, this section depicts a blueprint for collaborative innovation of industry, academia, research and medicine in China: through the special support of the state, we have not only made theoretical and model breakthroughs, but also made the output really \"visible and tangible\".<strong>of programs and equipment to bring good news to patients. In particular, the emphasis on the word \"domestic\" means that the core technology and products are independent and controllable, and are not controlled by others. This is critical to ensure large-scale clinical applications and to cope with international competition. At the same time, we also expect these results to have the attribute of sustainable evolution: with more data accumulation and technological progress, the solution can be updated and iterative, and the device can also be upgraded (such as using more advanced ACPU chips in the future to improve processing speed and algorithm performance). All this will establish China's leading position in the field of active intervention for movement disorders and provide an example for active medical exploration of other chronic diseases.</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"Three-to-five-year-project-phased-tasks-and-key-outcome-nodes\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Three-to-five-year-project-phased-tasks-and-key-outcome-nodes\" title=\"Three-to-five-year project phased tasks and key outcome nodes\"></a><strong>Three-to-five-year project phased tasks and key outcome nodes</strong></h1><p>The project is planned to be implemented in phases over a period of 3 to 5 years, and gradually achieve the goal of moving from basic theoretical research to system integration to demonstration application.

A Parkinson's disease center in a tertiary hospital was selected to conduct a small-scale clinical pilot. The content includes: using the platform to assist the actual patient's treatment decision-making (the doctor adjusts the plan according to the model recommendation) and observing the difference in efficacy compared with traditional empirical treatment; trial of the effect of BCI assistive devices in rehabilitation training; Remote monitoring and parameter tuning for patients receiving intelligent DBS. <em>Key node: Complete the data collection of at least 30 patients in the controlled trial, and the results show that the patients who applied the project system have statistically significant improvements in symptom improvement, complication control and other indicators, and write clinical research papers or reports</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Task 3.2: Industrialization Preparation and Regulatory Approval. Organize technical documents together with partner companies and prepare registration materials for related products. For example, the intelligent DBS system was submitted to the State Food and Drug Administration for review, and the BCI rehabilitation equipment applied for Class II medical device registration. <em>Key nodes: Obtain the registration approval of at least 1 product or enter the green channel pilot application; The guidelines for active diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease have been recognized by industry associations and have been published and applied within a certain range</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Task 3.3: Training Outreach and Feedback Improvement.

Comprehensively evaluate the completion of the project against the project indicators, and organize technical data and data archiving. Prepare for a larger-scale application promotion plan and possible commercialization paths, such as the establishment of a school-enterprise joint company to continue to advance. <em>Key node: through the national project acceptance, the acceptance experts recognized the innovation and application value of the project; Formulate a plan for the next stage of development, and clarify how to promote this achievement nationally and internationally</em>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Phase 3 Summary</em>: The final stage will really push our research into clinical practice and verify whether the \"paper talk\" translates into patient benefits. If it goes well, we will see real patients get better outcomes and improved quality of life because of our system. The hallmark of success at this stage lies not only in the data and papers, but also in clinical recognition and policy support: ideally, the system is endorsed and promoted by a team of leading Parkinson's experts in China, and health authorities see the promise of a proactive medicine model and provide policy support (e.g. inclusion in chronic disease management programs). We hope that by the end of the project, China has established a complete closed-loop management system for active intervention in Parkinson's disease in a demonstration center, and has the idea and foundation to promote this model to more diseases (Alzheimer's disease, motor neuron disease, etc.).</p>\n<p><strong>Milestones at a glance:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Milestone 1 (about 0.5 years)</strong> :D IKWP cognitive model of movement disorders was preliminarily completed, the basal ganglia loop simulation model was built, and the internal workshop evaluation was passed.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Milestone 2 (around the end of the first year):</strong> ACPU prototype and virtual patient v1.0 released, demonstrating the simple active intervention process, 2 patents submitted, and several papers published.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Milestone 3 (approx. end of year 2): The</strong> integration test of the active medicine platform was successful, and the closed-loop simulation intervention was effectively operational; The performance indicators of the Parkinson's disease digital twin model meet the predetermined requirements; Candidate list generation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Milestone 4 (around the end of the 3rd year):</strong> BCI Purpose reconstitution system successfully validated (healthy subject experiments), intelligent DBS algorithm successfully validated in animals; The core system enters the clinical trial preparation stage.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Milestone 5 (approx. 4-5 years):</strong> Clinical pilot data demonstrating significant improvement in efficacy; At least one smart device is approved for use; Project techniques and specifications began to be promoted in the industry.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Through the above-mentioned phased promotion and achievement output, this project will complete the whole process from theoretical innovation to clinical preliminary verification within 3-5 years, and effectively build an active medical intervention system for movement disorders integrating the DIKWP model. This not only achieves the goals required by the guidelines, but also lays a solid foundation for future development.</p>\n<h1 id=\"epilogue\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#epilogue\" title=\"epilogue\"></a><strong>epilogue</strong></h1><p>The project of \"Construction of Active Medical Research and Intervention System for Movement Disorder Neurological Diseases Integrating DIKWP Model\" is based on solving the major public health problem of Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders, and has carried out systematic design and planning from basic theory, technology research and development to clinical application. We make full use of Professor Yucong Duan's DIKWP artificial consciousness model and its derivative theories, deeply integrate it with neuroscience, and innovatively propose a semantic hierarchical disease model and an artificial consciousness-driven simulation control platform. By introducing the ACPU architecture, <strong>semantic elastic network, and self-explanatory mechanism</strong>, our system has the ability to explain and self-regulate that traditional AI does not have. Focusing on this core, we have built modules such as virtual patients, <strong>brain-computer interfaces</strong>, and <strong>closed-loop intervention devices, forming an overall solution for active medicine.</strong></p>\n<p>The implementation of this project will fill the gaps of the existing technology in the following aspects: firstly, realize the digital reconstruction of the whole chain of Parkinson's disease and other diseases from data to purpose, which will help solve the mystery of the complex mechanism of movement disorders; Secondly, the international advanced adaptive closed-loop intervention technology, such as intelligent DBS and BCI-assisted exercise, has been developed, which significantly improves the treatment effect and individualization. Thirdly, a new paradigm of model-driven drug screening was established to accelerate the discovery of new therapies. Finally, an active health management system for the grassroots and families has been created to realize long-term companionship medical care for patients. All these innovations are expected to raise China's scientific and technological level in the field of movement disorder prevention and treatment to a new height.</p>\n<p>Of course, the success of the project depends on the integration of multiple disciplines and the collaboration of multiple parties. In the course of the project, we will strengthen the collaborative research of experts in the fields of neurology, artificial intelligence, computer, biomedical engineering, etc., and closely cooperate with industry, academia, research and medicine. At the same time, we keep abreast of the latest international developments to ensure that our technology is always up-to-date and optimal, rather than working behind closed doors. <strong>The introduction of an evaluation system and a sustainable evolution mechanism ensures the reliability and vitality of the project results – our system will continue to improve itself with data and experience, becoming more intelligent and accurate. More importantly, the compound talent team cultivated and trained by this project will become an important force in the field of active medicine and artificial intelligence + medical care in China, providing human support for continuous technological iteration.</strong></p>\n<p>Looking to the future, if the system developed in this project is widely used, patients with Parkinson's disease will no longer rely on passive medication or waiting for surgery, but can receive individualized and comprehensive intervention at the early stage of the disease, and enjoy the protection and guidance of intelligent systems throughout the disease process. The quality of life of patients will be greatly improved, and the burden on families and society will be reduced. This reflects the purpose of science and technology to be people-oriented and serve people's livelihood. In addition, the methodology of this project can be extended to other chronic neurological diseases, creating a new era of disease digitalization and intervention initiative.</p>\n<p>To sum up, this project will promote a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of movement disorders in a scientific sense, create an independent intelligent medical platform in China in a technical sense, and bring new prevention and treatment methods in a clinical sense. Through 3-5 years of hard work, we are confident that we will deliver a high-quality answer sheet: to achieve <strong>the unity of theoretical innovation, technological breakthrough and clinical application, to achieve the goals guided by the guidelines, and to make significant contributions to the \"research on the pathogenesis and intervention treatment of Parkinson's disease and other movement disorder neurological diseases\" in China. At the same time, this project will also set a demonstration for the deep integration of artificial intelligence and medicine, and help China seize the commanding heights of future medical reform.

Background and significance of the study\"></a><strong>1. Background and significance of the study</strong></h1><p>Brain development disorders (such as autism spectrum disorder, ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, intellectual development disorder, etc.) are neurodevelopmental diseases that seriously affect the physical and mental health of children and adolescents. These disorders have an early onset and a long course of illness, and are often accompanied by lifelong deficits in social, cognitive, and behavioral functioning, placing a heavy burden on families and society. According to statistics, the global incidence of autism spectrum disorder in children has increased significantly in recent years, and the prevalence of ASD in 8-year-old children in some areas has reached about 3%. The prevalence of ADHD in school-age children is about 5%, and the co-incidence of ADHD in ASD is as high as more than 50%. These disorders of brain development have become an important part of the global burden of disease. However, the etiological mechanisms of such diseases are extremely complex, involving multiple levels such as genetic variation, molecular pathways, abnormal brain network development, and environmental factors. Traditional research tends to focus on a single level, such as genomic analysis revealing candidate genes, neuroimaging studies revealing differences in brain structure and functional connectivity, and psychological studies characterizing cognitive and behavioral characteristics, but the research at each level is relatively fragmented, and there is a lack of a unified theoretical framework to link \"bottom-up\" biological data with \"top-down\" cognitive and behavioral symptoms. This cross-level knowledge gap makes it difficult to fully understand the pathogenic mechanisms of brain development diseases. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a theoretical model that integrates multi-scale and multi-dimensional information and can unly explain the disorders from biological basis to higher-order cognitive dysfunction, so as to deepen the understanding of disease mechanisms and guide the development of new diagnosis and treatment strategies.</p>\n<p>The Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) model is a conceptual framework commonly used in the field of information science and cognition to describe the level of abstraction from raw data to Wisdom decision-making. However, the traditional DIKW model presents a strict hierarchical (pyramid) structure, with one-way transmission between layers, which is difficult to adapt to the complex feedback regulation characteristics and purpose-oriented behaviors of the human brain. In view of this, Prof. Yucong Duan, the applicant of this project, took the lead in proposing a new cognitive model with a \"Purpose/Purpose\" layer on the basis of DIKW, namely the DIKWP model. More importantly, the DIKWP model does not simply stack a new level, but connects the five elements of data, information, knowledge, wisdom, and purpose through a non-hierarchical network structure to form a cognitive network with multi-directional feedback and iterative updates. This original reticular cognitive model is an academic milestone, breaking through the limitations of the traditional linear cognitive framework and providing a new semantic structure for machine intelligence to simulate human cognition. By integrating \"Purpose\" into the model as an explicit level, the cognitive process not only includes the understanding of the objective world, but also the consideration of the subject's goal and purpose, so as to be closer to the essence of human thinking. The introduction of a purpose-oriented cognitive system is regarded as an innovative way to solve the \"black box\" problem in the field of artificial intelligence and improve the interpretability and controllability of AI systems. For brain development diseases, the cross-level semantic mapping capability of the DIKWP model has unique theoretical value: it provides us with a unified modeling framework that can integrate the abnormal representations of such diseases at different scales (from molecular and EEG data, to neural information processing, knowledge acquisition disorders, to impaired decision-making wisdom and lack of purpose) into the same semantic network for characterization and interpretation.</p>\n<p>Specifically, in diseases such as autism, patients often exhibit abnormal sensory data processing (e.g., hyperesthesia or sluggishness), insufficient information integration ability (e.g., distracted attention, difficulty filtering stimuli), social cognitive deficits at the knowledge level (e.g., lack of understanding of the purpose of others' minds), inappropriate decision-making at the wisdom level (e.g., stereotyped behavior, lack of flexibility), and lack of social motivation at the purpose level. Traditionally, these symptoms have been explained separately by different theories, such as sensory integration dysregulation theory, theory of mind deficits, \"executive function\" disorder, etc., but lack a convergence perspective. The DIKWP model is expected to describe the dysfunction at the above levels in a unified language: from the abnormality of sensory input in the \"data\" layer to the disorder of attention/perceptual processing in the \"information\" layer, to the insufficient acquisition of social semantics in the \"knowledge\" layer, the impaired decision-making reasoning in the \"Wisdom\" layer, and the abnormality of motivation and purpose in the \"Purpose\" layer, forming a coherent causal chain and network. It can also be used as an analogy in ADHD: this model can uniformly represent how impulsive tendencies at the gene and neurotransmitter levels affect the attention control of the information layer, which in turn disrupts knowledge accumulation and task planning (Wisdom layer), leading to difficulties in maintaining intentional behavior (Purpose layer). Similarly, for intellectual developmental disabilities, the DIKWP framework is able to correlate the biological roots of cognitive delay with its performance at the level of knowledge acquisition and application. It can be seen that the DIKWP network cognitive model, as a unified modeling tool for cross-level cognitive mechanisms, can comprehensively reveal the pathological mechanisms of brain development diseases at different levels and explore the interaction between different levels, which cannot be achieved by traditional single-level research. This unique theoretical value will provide a new perspective for deepening the study of the etiology of brain developmental diseases, and provide systematic guidance for diagnosis and intervention.</p>\n<p>While introducing the DIKWP model, this project will integrate <strong>the theory of artificial consciousness (AC) to deepen the analysis of higher-order dysfunction of brain developmental diseases. Artificial consciousness is the frontier direction in the field of artificial intelligence, which is committed to enabling machines to simulate the generation process and functional characteristics of human consciousness, including perception, emotion, willingness, and self-awareness.</strong> Professor Yucong Duan's DIKWP model is an important theoretical cornerstone of the artificial consciousness system: based on this model, he proposed the \"DIKWP×DIKWP\" artificial consciousness system architecture, which adds a metacognitive cycle (the second DIKWP cycle) to the basic cognitive process to realize the primary self-awareness functions such as self-monitoring, self-reflection and self-regulation. This \"dual circulation\" architecture is seen as a key way to build AI systems with autonomous awareness. The artificial consciousness model provides a new research tool for the problems of self-perception deficits, attentional control disorders, and abnormal motivation and willingness shown by patients with brain development disorders: we can simulate and analyze the dysfunctional mechanisms of corresponding functions in the patient's brain with the help of artificial intelligence with self-monitoring and purpose representation capabilities. For example, by artificially introducing perturbations such as \"Purpose layer loss\" or \"abnormal attention control parameters\" into the DIKWP network, the changes in the overall cognitive behavior of the artificial consciousness can be observed, so as to deduce the cause of the patient's symptoms by analogy. This method breaks through the limitations of inferring pathology only through clinical observation and passive data analysis, and can actively simulate the consciousness and cognitive processes in disease states, which is expected to reveal the internal mechanism of autism and other diseases in terms of self-awareness and higher-order cognition.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the theoretical basis and significance of this project are as follows: taking the applicant's original DIKWP*DIKWP mesh cognitive model as the core, integrating artificial consciousness simulation methods, constructing a unified framework across the five layers of semantic space of data, information, knowledge, Wisdom and Purpose, and systematically analyzing the pathogenic mechanism of brain development diseases. This not only fills the gap in the current multi-scale research on the integration of brain science and cognitive science, but also is expected to bring a paradigm shift in clinical diagnosis and treatment: from a symptom-oriented empirical approach to precise intervention guided by cognitive mechanism models, so as to open up a new path for the diagnosis and treatment of brain developmental diseases.</p>\n<h1 id=\"2-the-overall-goal-and-technical-route\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-the-overall-goal-and-technical-route\" title=\"2. the overall goal and technical route\"></a><strong>2. the overall goal and technical route</strong></h1><p><strong>Overall Objective: This project aims to construct a unified cognitive mechanism model based on the \"DIKWP×DIKWP\" non-hierarchical network cognitive model and artificial consciousness theory for typical brain development diseases such as autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of diseases across all levels of data-information-knowledge-wisdom-purpose, and then to explore new diagnostic indicators and intervention targets, and to propose integrated diagnosis and treatment strategies and technical solutions driven by artificial awareness. Specifically, it includes the following five objectives:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Establish DIKWP×DIKWP cognitive models to achieve unified modeling of cross-level cognitive mechanisms of brain development diseases: improve the DIKWP network cognitive model proposed by Professor Yucong Duan and expand it into a \"dual circulation\" DIKWP ×DIKWP architecture to characterize the whole process mechanism of patients from biological signals to cognitive purpose. Through this model, we can unify the elements involved in this project (genetic and molecular data, neural circuit information, cognitive knowledge representation, decision-making wisdom and purpose behavior), provide a unified semantic framework for disease mechanism research, and highlight the applicability and unique value of the DIKWP model in different diseases such as autism, ADHD, and intellectual disability.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Artificial consciousness system was used to deeply analyze the mechanism of higher-order neurological dysfunction in patients: an artificial consciousness simulation system was constructed based on the DIKWP × DIKWP architecture, so that it could have the functions of perception, self-awareness and purpose decision-making. The system was used to simulate and analyze the mechanism of higher-order dysfunctions such as self-perception deficits, attention control disorders, behavioral motivation and purpose-oriented abnormalities in patients with brain development diseases. Through the simulation of the \"failure\" or parameter abnormality of the corresponding modules in the artificial consciousness body, the internal causes of the above symptoms and the interaction between various cognitive levels are explored, and the explanatory power of the artificial consciousness model in the study of disease mechanism is verified.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>To construct a multi-scale integrated model of brain developmental diseases and a DIKWP cognitive layer evaluation framework for auxiliary diagnosis and brain-like model calibration: collect and integrate the big data of patients with brain developmental diseases at different scales such as molecular, cellular, neural circuit, cognitive behavior, etc., and establish a multi-scale disease model. On this basis, the DIKWP structured cognitive layer evaluation framework was introduced, and quantitative indicators at each level (such as biomarker characteristics in the data layer, attention/perceptual function indicators in the information layer, cognitive test results in the knowledge layer, decision-making ability score in the Wisdom layer, and social motivation assessment in the Purpose layer) were designed. An intelligent auxiliary diagnosis system was developed to map the multimodal data of patients to the DIKWP framework for comprehensive evaluation, so as to improve the accuracy of early identification and classification diagnosis of diseases. At the same time, the evaluation framework is used for</strong> the calibration of brain-inspired computing models (such as neural network models or brain simulation systems) to ensure that the behavior of the model at each cognitive level is consistent with the characteristics of human diseases, so as to improve the credibility of the model in predicting disease mechanisms and efficacy.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>A therapeutic target identification method based on cognitive interaction perturbation mapping was proposed, and an integrated diagnosis and treatment program driven by artificial consciousness was developed: the cognitive interaction perturbation mapping experiment was designed by using the established DIKWP ×DIKWP artificial consciousness model, that is, virtual intervention or perturbation was carried out for different levels of elements in the model (such as adjusting the activity of a molecular pathway, simulating and improving the intensity of a certain cognitive training, etc.), and the impact on the overall cognitive function and pathological state was observed. Through systematic intervention screening in silico</strong>, key nodes that can effectively improve the abnormal cognitive representation in the model were identified as potential therapeutic targets. Corresponding intervention strategies were developed for these targets, including small molecule drugs acting on abnormal neurotransmitter pathways, gene editing/treatment to correct pathogenic genes, and cell therapy to supplement defective neuron types. At the same time, the synergistic effect of the combined intervention was evaluated in the artificial consciousness simulation, and the closed-loop integrated diagnosis and treatment plan of \"diagnosis-mechanism model-intervention response-cognitive reconstruction\" was optimized. The program will take the artificial consciousness system as the core decision-making engine, intelligently recommend personalized intervention combinations according to the results of multi-layer evaluation of patients' DIKWP, and predict the efficacy. This AI-driven approach is expected to significantly accelerate target discovery and treatment design, and improve the accuracy and effectiveness of interventions for brain development diseases.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Develop a digital cognitive rehabilitation system and a simulated consciousness training platform for patients with brain development disorders, and verify the effectiveness in the preclinical model: Based on the above theoretical and technical achievements, a digital rehabilitation training system for patients with brain development disorders is developed. The system will include digital cognitive rehabilitation modules</strong> (such as a series of interactive training games or virtual reality scenarios designed for attention, memory, social cognition, etc.) and simulated awareness training modules (i.e., virtual partners or coaches driven by artificial consciousness with personalized interaction and situational guidance functions). Patients repeatedly practice their weak cognitive skills (e.g., social dialogue, self-emotion recognition, concentration exercises, etc.) by interacting with simulated consciousness bodies in a safe and controlled digital environment. The system uses the DIKWP framework to evaluate the progress of patient training at multiple levels, and adaptively adjusts the training content and difficulty to achieve personalized rehabilitation. We will first validate the efficacy and safety of the system in preclinical models, such as testing the effects of certain trained stimuli on neuroplasticity in animals in autism models, or recruiting a small number of children with developmental disabilities for a preliminary feasibility trial. Referring to existing research, virtual reality combined with AI has been used to improve the social skills of people with autism and has proven to be effective; Digital play therapies such as EndeavorRx have also been approved by the FDA for improving attention in children with ADHD. Therefore, the cognitive rehabilitation platform developed in this project is expected to enter clinical application after validation, providing children with a new choice of digital therapeutics.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Technical route: This project will be promoted in accordance with the process of mechanism model construction→ artificial consciousness simulation→ multi-scale integration → target discovery → scheme research and development→ system development and verification, and each module will be connected and gradually deepened to form a closed-loop research path (see figure omitted). Firstly, at the theoretical level, the framework of DIKWP × DIKWP unified cognitive model was established to define the elements at each level and their interaction relationships. Based on this, an artificial consciousness simulation platform was developed to realize the digital reproduction of human cognitive processes. Subsequently, a large number of multimodal data related to brain development diseases (including genome/proteome data, brain imaging and electrophysiological data, neuropsychological assessment results, etc.) were collected to build a multi-scale database of diseases, and mapped into the DIKWP model for comprehensive analysis. In the simulation platform, the model parameters are flexibly adjusted and computational experiments are carried out</strong>: on the one hand, the functional deficits at each level under the disease state are simulated to verify the explanatory power of the model, and on the other hand, various virtual interventions are introduced to evaluate their improvement effect on the pathological state in the model (i.e., cognitive perturbation experiments). By comparing the effects of different perturbations, the most potential intervention methods and corresponding biological targets were screened. Next, a specific diagnosis and treatment plan was designed based on the screening results, and the artificial awareness system was used to optimize and iterate the program—the AI agent will continuously adjust the intervention combination based on the simulation feedback until the best cognitive improvement effect is obtained. Based on the optimization plan, we will enter the application development stage: develop intelligent auxiliary diagnosis software (embedded in the existing diagnosis process of the hospital to realize the automatic analysis and risk assessment of multi-level indicators of patients) and a digital rehabilitation training platform (rehabilitation app or VR system for patients to use in the clinical or home environment). Finally, animal model experiments and small-scale clinical trials were used to validate and evaluate the proposed protocol and system, collect evidence of efficacy and safety, and improve technical details. The whole technical route emphasizes human-computer interaction and iterative improvement: the model results will guide the biological experiment, and the experimental data will in turn correct the model parameters; Similarly, the trial feedback of the diagnosis and treatment system will also be used to further improve the artificial awareness algorithm and cognitive model, forming a closed loop of continuous evolution. Through the above route, we will deliver a complete solution covering \"mechanism analysis, intelligent diagnosis, target screening, innovative therapy, and rehabilitation training\" at the end of the project period, providing full-chain support from theory to application for brain development diseases.</p>\n<h1 id=\"3-Sub-module-research-content\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-Sub-module-research-content\" title=\"3.

Specific work includes:</p>\n<p>1) <strong>Formal definition of DIKWP × DIKWP model</strong>: On the basis of the original DIKWP mesh model, the \"dual circulation\" architecture is introduced, and the basic cognitive process and metacognitive process are combined to form the DIKWP × DIKWP model. We will define the nodes and relationships of the model in a mathematically and computer-executable form, such as using directed graphs or tensor networks to represent the five elements and two-way feedback connections, so as to ensure that the model is strictly logically self-consistent and computable.</p>\n<p>2) <strong>Disease cognitive representation mapping</strong>: For the three types of autism, ADHD and intellectual disability, the typical abnormal manifestations of autism, information, knowledge, wisdom and purpose are summarized based on literature and expert knowledge, and these abnormalities are anchored to the corresponding nodes or connections of the model. For example, sensory hypersensitivity in autism can be mapped to abnormal input signal gain in the data layer, imperfect semantic network in the knowledge layer corresponding to social comprehension disorders, and insufficient activation of nodes in the purpose layer due to low social motivation. Through this mapping, a model characterization of the disease is established.</p>\n<p>3) <strong>Cross-level mechanism hypothesis testing</strong>: The constructed model is used to verify several important cross-level mechanism hypotheses in the simulation environment. For example, to test \"how information filtering disorder leads to impaired knowledge acquisition\": to simulate the decline of attention control (information layer) function, and to observe changes in the learning performance of new concepts in the knowledge layer, so as to explain the association between attention deficit and academic difficulties in ADHD; In another example, the reverse inhibitory effect of the reduction of social motivation on the perceptual-knowledge layer in the Purpose layer was simulated to explain the vicious circle of sensory overload and social avoidance in autism. These simulations will produce quantitative data that can be used to validate the plausibility of the model.</p>\n<p>4) <strong>Model optimization and unified theory</strong>: According to the simulation results and experimental feedback, the model parameters and structure are continuously modified to make it possible to explain the multi-level characteristics of multiple diseases at the same time, and extract the common mechanisms and differences across diseases. This module is expected to form the final version of the DIKWP × DIKWP unified cognitive mechanism model, which will serve as the cornerstone of all subsequent research work.</p>\n<p>Expected Results: Complete the construction of DIKWP×DIKWP model and disease mechanism mapping, publish 1~2 model-related theoretical papers, and form a systematic theoretical explanation of the cross-layer cognitive mechanism of brain development diseases. Several key pathological hypotheses were verified in the model to provide a basis for the formulation of follow-up intervention strategies. The model will be presented in the form of a map or software, visually demonstrating the mechanism of disease association from the biological level to the cognitive level, providing an intuitive tool for scientific research and teaching.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Module-2-Analysis-of-higher-order-neurological-dysfunction-mechanisms-based-on-artificial-consciousness-theory\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Module-2-Analysis-of-higher-order-neurological-dysfunction-mechanisms-based-on-artificial-consciousness-theory\" title=\"Module 2: Analysis of higher-order neurological dysfunction mechanisms based on artificial consciousness theory\"></a><strong>Module 2: Analysis of higher-order neurological dysfunction mechanisms based on artificial consciousness theory</strong></h2><p><strong>Research content: This module uses the DIKWP × DIKWP model established in module 1 to construct an artificial consciousness system and conduct an in-depth analysis of higher-order dysfunction in patients with brain development diseases. Main research steps: 1) Artificial consciousness system development: design and implement an artificial consciousness agent (software agent) based on DIKWP ×DIKWP architecture. The agent consists of two parts: the basic cognitive cycle (realizing the perception, processing and decision-making of environmental data) and the metacognitive cycle (monitoring and regulating one's own cognitive state). We will endow the agent with human-like physiological parameters (such as virtual receptive field, memory capacity, reward mechanism, etc.) and emotion and purpose representation mechanisms, so that it has a similar perceptual-emotional-voluntary function as humans. 2) Normal cognitive baseline training: Artificial consciousness agents are trained to complete a series of cognitive tasks in a virtual environment through reinforcement learning and other techniques as a baseline for normal functioning. For example, it is trained to focus on goal-oriented tasks to ensure that the agent has a certain ability to control attention and maintain purpose. Train them to interact with virtual social individuals to develop self-other-awareness and social behavior patterns. Once the training converges, the agent will exhibit a relatively stable functional state in all layers of the DIKWP, close to the expected human function.</strong> 3) <strong>Disease state simulation</strong>: Targeted perturbation of artificial consciousness agents to simulate higher-order dysfunction of patients. Specifically, <em>self-perception deficit simulation</em> - weakens the performance of the self-monitoring module in the metacognitive loop, and makes the agent slow to perceive changes in his own state (error, success, etc.), so as to simulate the self-awareness disorder of autistic patients; <em>Attention deficit simulation</em>: introducing noise or reducing attention selectivity in the information layer to observe the agent's ADHD-like transient attention and distracted behavior; <em>Motivational Willingness Disorder Simulation</em>: Reducing the agent's sensitivity to task reward or goal adherence at the Purpose layer, resulting in a state of insufficient motivation and poor behavioral purposefulness in the artificial consciousness body, similar to the lack of social motivation in autism or poor persistence in ADHD. By placing agents in these perturbed states to perform tasks, we will collect data on their behavioral performance and internal state and compare them with the results of cognitive assessments in real patients. 4) <strong>Mechanism analysis</strong>: Based on the results of simulation experiments, the key internal mechanisms that cause specific higher-order dysfunctions are extracted. For example, we may find that when the information filtering (attention control) is weakened, the representation confusion of the agent knowledge layer increases, and the decision-making error rate increases, which confirms the supporting role of attention on high-level cognition. In another example, when the driving force of the Purpose layer is reduced, the agent is more likely to abort the task when encountering difficulties, which illustrates how the lack of motivation leads to insufficient behavioral persistence. These findings will be used to explain the intrinsic causal chain of the patient's symptoms and provide clues to interventions (e.g., whether enhancement of a certain layer of function compensates for the deficit). 5) <strong>Model validation</strong>: Some mechanisms will be selected to be verified in real patients or animal models, such as using brain imaging technology to observe whether the abnormal activation of brain information filtering related networks in ADHD patients during attention tasks is consistent with simulation prediction. The validation results will further feed back the correction of the surrogate model.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Results: Completed the prototype development of the artificial consciousness agent system, and successfully simulated the behavioral characteristics of typical higher-order dysfunctions such as autism and ADHD. He has produced a mechanism explanation model for the dysfunction of brain development diseases in terms of self-awareness, attention, and willingness,</strong> and has published more than one academic paper in authoritative journals at home and abroad. This work will demonstrate for the first time that artificial consciousness systems can be used to study disease mechanisms, deepen our understanding of the nature of these higher-order cognitive impairments, and lay the foundation for the development of innovative therapies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Module-3-Multi-scale-Modeling-of-Brain-Development-Diseases-and-Construction-of-DIKWP-Cognitive-Level-Assessment-Framework\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Module-3-Multi-scale-Modeling-of-Brain-Development-Diseases-and-Construction-of-DIKWP-Cognitive-Level-Assessment-Framework\" title=\"Module 3: Multi-scale Modeling of Brain Development Diseases and Construction of DIKWP Cognitive Level Assessment Framework\"></a><strong>Module 3: Multi-scale Modeling of Brain Development Diseases and Construction of DIKWP Cognitive Level Assessment Framework</strong></h2><p><strong>Research content: This module focuses on connecting multi-scale biological data of brain development diseases with cognitive models, establishing multi-scale disease models from molecular to in vivo</strong> levels, introducing the DIKWP structured cognitive layer evaluation system, and developing intelligent auxiliary diagnosis and model calibration tools. The main contents are as follows: 1) <strong>Multi-scale data integration and disease modeling</strong>: Collect multi-level data related to brain development disorders in project partner hospitals and public databases, including: genetic and epigenetic data (pathogenic gene variation, copy number variation, DNA methylation, etc.), molecular and cellular level data (blood and cerebrospinal fluid biochemical markers, neurotransmitter levels, histopathology, etc.), neural circuit level data (functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI connection mode, EEG/ magnetoencephalography, brain network atlas, etc.) and behavioral and cognitive assessment data (scales, questionnaires, neuropsychological test scores, etc.). Multi-modal data fusion technology is used to map data of different scales to the same patient object, and a multi-scale feature vector or knowledge graph of disease is established. If necessary, the dimensionality reduction and clustering methods of machine learning are applied to extract the key variables that can represent the main pathological features from the massive features. 2) <strong>DIKWP cognitive layer evaluation index extraction</strong>: According to the DIKWP framework, the above multi-scale features were mapped to five cognitive levels. For example, gene/cell abnormalities are classified as \"data layer\" lesions, simple perceptual function and attention indicators are classified as \"information layer\", language ability and social cognition test results are classified as \"knowledge layer\", complex decision-making and problem-solving ability assessment are classified as \"wisdom layer\", and motivation, interest, and goal-related scale results are classified as \"purpose layer\". A composite score or set of indicators is designed for each level to quantify the patient's degree of functional integrity at that level. We will develop the DIKWP multi-level cognitive function assessment scale, which integrates subjective and objective data to profile patients in an all-round way. 3) <strong>Development of intelligent auxiliary diagnosis system</strong>: Based on the above evaluation framework, a machine learning model is established to output diagnostic suggestions after inputting the patient's multi-layer feature vectors. For example, training a classification model to identify ASD, ADHD, or intellectual disability categories, or further classify subtypes; Train regression models to predict disease severity scores, and more. In particular, we pay attention to the contribution of the combination of indicators at each level of DIKWP to diagnosis, hoping to discover cross-level diagnostic feature patterns and improve the diagnostic accuracy and ability to distinguish comorbidities (such as ASD with ADHD). In addition, a visual interface was developed to visually display the five-layer DIKWP score radar chart of patients to clinicians to assist clinical decision-making. 4) <strong>Calibration and verification of brain-inspired models</strong>: select the current international advanced brain computing models or simulation platforms (such as large neural networks to simulate the cognitive process of the human brain), and apply our DIKWP evaluation framework to its output to evaluate the cognitive performance of the model. If the DIKWP spectrum of the model is systematically biased from that of real patients, we will adjust the model structure or parameters (such as adding feedback connections at the Purpose layer) to make it closer to the real pathology. This process can also be seen as a validation of the DIKWP theory: a successful calibration will prove the universality and validity of the DIKWP framework.</p>\n<p>Expected Results: Establish a multimodal database containing ≥ 100 patients and a hierarchical evaluation system of DIKWP. One prototype system for intelligent diagnosis of brain development diseases has been developed, and its diagnostic accuracy is improved compared with existing methods (for example, the diagnostic accuracy of ASD is increased by no less than 5 percentage points). He has written 1 paper on multi-scale data fusion diagnosis. The applicability of the DIKWP framework in the simulation system was verified through the evaluation and calibration of the brain-inspired model, and the relevant results were published in interdisciplinary journals. The results of this module will provide a directly applicable auxiliary diagnostic tool for clinical practice, and provide an objective quantitative means for the evaluation of follow-up intervention strategies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Module-4-Therapeutic-target-discovery-based-on-cognitive-interaction-perturbation-mapping-and-research-on-artificial-consciousness-driven-diagnosis-and-treatment-protocols\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Module-4-Therapeutic-target-discovery-based-on-cognitive-interaction-perturbation-mapping-and-research-on-artificial-consciousness-driven-diagnosis-and-treatment-protocols\" title=\"Module 4: Therapeutic target discovery based on cognitive interaction perturbation mapping and research on artificial consciousness-driven diagnosis and treatment protocols\"></a><strong>Module 4: Therapeutic target discovery based on cognitive interaction perturbation mapping and research on artificial consciousness-driven diagnosis and treatment protocols</strong></h2><p><strong>Research content: This module aims to use the aforementioned cognitive models and artificial awareness platforms to discover innovative drugs and other intervention targets, and to construct AI-driven integrated diagnosis and treatment protocols. The core idea is to explore potential interventions through trial and error in a simulated environment, and to screen for the best options by simulating their impact on cognitive function. The main research steps are:</strong> 1) <strong>Cognitive interaction perturbation mapping experiment</strong>: in the artificial consciousness simulation platform, the biophysical and cognitive parameters that can be adjusted (such as neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity parameters, corresponding to drug effects) are introduced into the artificial consciousness simulation platform; Gene expression levels correspond to gene therapy; Specific cognitive training intensity corresponds to rehabilitation therapy, etc.). Using the method of high-throughput computational experiments, these parameters were adjusted one by one or in combination, and the impact on the performance indicators of each layer of the agent DIKWP and the overall task performance were recorded, and the \"intervention-effect\" mapping network was drawn. Particular attention is paid to changes in parameters that significantly improve the agent's cognitive deficit (the abnormality simulated in Module 2) and locate their corresponding biological implications. For example, the discovery that increasing levels of a certain neurotransmitter can alleviate simulated attention impairment suggests that this neurotransmitter pathway may be a drug target for ADHD. 2) <strong>Screening of candidate therapeutic targets</strong>: Comprehensively mapping the results to screen out the key intervention nodes at multiple levels: at the molecular level, there may be several high-impact genes or proteins; At the cellular circuit level, it may be the pattern of activity of a particular brain region or neural circuit; At the cognitive level, it may be some kind of training paradigm. Combined with literature search and expert knowledge, the biological rationality and feasibility of these nodes were evaluated, and some of the most promising novel targets were selected. For example, if it is found that modulating prefrontal-hippocampal circuit connectivity significantly improves learning ability in the model, then this circuit is used as an intervention target for electrical stimulation or neuromodulation. We plan to select 2-3 targets in each disease for further validation. 3) <strong>Formulation and optimization of intervention strategies</strong>: design specific intervention strategies for each target screened. For example, for molecular targets, molecular docking and virtual screening are used to find potential small molecule drugs, or topical use of existing drugs is considered for indications (drug retargeting); For gene targets, design gene therapy protocols (e.g., vector delivery RNA interference or CRISPR correction); For cell/loop targets, optogenetics, transcranial magnetic stimulation and other technical means should be considered for regulation. For purely cognitive targets, develop intensive training or behavioral therapy protocols. In the artificial awareness platform, a more refined virtual patient model (taking into account individual differences) is introduced to simulate the effects and synergies of the above interventions. If multiple targets require joint intervention, we will apply reinforcement learning algorithms to allow AI to autonomously experiment with the combination and sequence of interventions to optimize efficacy and reduce side effects. The result is a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan for different subtypes of patients, including specific drug/non-drug intervention combinations and procedures. 4) <strong>Experimental validation</strong>: select some representative intervention programs and carry out validation experiments in vitro and animal models. For example, to test whether the effects of a new drug on social behavior and brain functional connectivity are consistent with model predictions in a mouse model of autism; Specific brain stimulation interventions were administered to ADHD model mice, and attention improvement was observed. Some safer interventions (e.g., cognitive training regimens) will also be evaluated in preclinical human trials: a small sample of patients will be recruited to observe changes in DIKWP before and after the intervention, compared to model expectations. The results of the validation are used to adjust and refine the diagnosis and treatment plan. 5) <strong>Closed-loop feedback mechanism</strong>: The verification data is fed back to the AI-driven decision-making system, and the intervention decision-making algorithm is constantly updated to make it gradually self-improve in the real world, and finally form a closed-loop treatment system of artificial consciousness that can be used in clinical practice.</p>\n<p>Expected Results: Propose a variety of innovative therapeutic targets and intervention strategies, and apply for no less than 2 related invention patents. At least 1 new drug target (e.g., animal experiments have demonstrated that improving the function of a certain protein can improve autistic behavior), 1 new physical/digital intervention method (e.g., VR scenario training combined with transcranial electrical stimulation to improve attention), and 1~2 papers have been published. Integrate the above results to form a white paper or guideline manuscript of AI-driven diagnosis and treatment plan for brain development diseases, covering disease identification, target selection, personalized intervention process, etc., to lay the foundation for subsequent clinical trials and application promotion. The results of this module will connect the \"last mile\" from mechanism to intervention, bringing practical new therapies to patients.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Module-5-Development-and-effectiveness-verification-of-digital-cognitive-rehabilitation-system-and-simulated-consciousness-training-platform\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Module-5-Development-and-effectiveness-verification-of-digital-cognitive-rehabilitation-system-and-simulated-consciousness-training-platform\" title=\"Module 5: Development and effectiveness verification of digital cognitive rehabilitation system and simulated consciousness training platform\"></a><strong>Module 5: Development and effectiveness verification of digital cognitive rehabilitation system and simulated consciousness training platform</strong></h2><p>Research content: Based on the intervention strategies proposed in Module 4, this module is oriented to clinical applications, develops a comprehensive platform for digital cognitive rehabilitation and artificial awareness training, and verifies its effectiveness and safety through preclinical studies. The main tasks are as follows:</p>\n<p>1) <strong>Overall system architecture design</strong>: According to the rehabilitation needs of patients with brain development diseases, the functional modules and processes of the digital rehabilitation system are designed. The system will take the form of a client application or a virtual reality platform, including: an evaluation module (collecting multi-level cognitive data of patients and accessing the evaluation framework of module 3), a training module (a training game or task set for different cognitive functions), an artificial awareness counselor module (an intelligent agent monitors patient performance in real time, gives feedback and guidance), and a data recording and analysis module (records training data for efficacy evaluation and strategy adjustment). Determine system hardware requirements (e.g., VR headsets, brain-computer interface optional components, etc.) and data security specifications.</p>\n<p>2) <strong>Rehabilitation training content development</strong>: A series of training content is designed according to each cognitive level of DIKWP. For example, data/information layer training includes sensory integration training, attention concentration exercises (such as target finding stimulation games); Knowledge-level training includes language comprehension and social cognitive training (role-playing games, talking to virtual characters and practicing social skills); Wisdom layer training includes problem-solving and situational decision simulation (completing tasks in a virtual campus environment to train planning and execution functions); Purpose-level training focuses on enhancing motivation and self-awareness (recognizing emotions through virtual characters, training patients to recognize their own emotions and set goals). Each training session will be set with multiple difficulty levels and personalized parameters to suit patients of different ability levels, and will be dynamically adjusted under the control of AI coaches.</p>\n<p>3) <strong>Artificial Awareness Counselor Development</strong>: Use the artificial awareness agent of module 2 to create the image of \"virtual rehabilitation therapist\". The agent is implanted in the rehabilitation system and assumes a variety of roles: for example, when the patient is engaged in social training, the agent plays the role of a dialogue partner to present different expressions and reactions; In attention training, the agent monitors the patient's concentration and gives prompts or rewards in a timely manner; In Purpose training, the agent discusses goals with the patient to enhance their autonomy. The agent will evaluate the patient's status based on the patient's real-time performance (obtained through motion capture, physiological sensing, etc.), and decide the next interaction according to preset rules or reinforcement learning strategies (such as increasing the difficulty of the challenge or switching training strategies), forming a closed-loop human-computer interaction training process.</p>\n<p>4) <strong>Software integration and testing</strong>: develop the above modules into software prototypes and integrate them into a unified platform. Functional testing and user experience optimization were carried out, and rehabilitation therapists and some patients were invited to participate in trial feedback to improve the interactive interface and process. Ensure the system is easy to use, fun, and motivating to improve patient compliance.</p>\n<p>5) <strong>Effectiveness</strong> verification: select appropriate animal models and human volunteers to carry out preclinical trials. For animals (e.g., genetically engineered autism model mice), a customized training device was used to provide some digital-like training elements (such as perceptual stimuli and reward mechanisms) to observe the effects of long-term training on their behavior and brain plasticity, and to verify the biological effects of digital cognitive stimuli. For humans, a small-sample, single-group controlled trial will be carried out in collaboration with clinicians: several children with autism or ADHD will be recruited, and a digital rehabilitation system will be added to the standard treatment for a period of time, and the changes in DIKWP indicators and clinical symptoms (such as improvement of attention test scores, changes in social behavior rating scores, etc.) will be compared before and after the intervention. At the same time, adverse events and technical issues are closely monitored to assess system safety and stability. If conditions permit, a control group can also be set up for a preliminary study of randomized controlled trials. The validation results will be analyzed using statistical methods to determine the achievement of the preliminary efficacy of the system.</p>\n<p>Expected Results: Completed the development of one set of \"Digital Cognitive Rehabilitation and Simulation Awareness Training Platform for Brain Development Disorders\", and obtained the relevant qualifications for computer software copyright or medical device registration. Previous clinical studies have been projected to demonstrate a positive effect of the system in improving target cognitive function (e.g., a significant increase in the average attention score after training, or an improvement in social interaction behavior ratings) with no significant adverse effects. We will write a report on the results of system development and experiments, and publish one paper in a journal in the field of rehabilitation medicine or digital medicine. In addition, based on the validation results, the system was improved and upgraded to prepare for the next large-scale clinical trial. This module will ultimately deliver an innovative rehabilitation tool with clinical potential to improve the prognosis of patients with brain development disorders in combination with traditional treatments.</p>\n<h1 id=\"4-feasibility-analysis\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-feasibility-analysis\" title=\"4. feasibility analysis\"></a><strong>4. feasibility analysis</strong></h1><p>Technical and theoretical feasibility: This project is built on a solid foundation of preliminary research and a mature theoretical framework. The applicant, Professor Yucong Duan, has been deeply involved in the field of cognitive computing and artificial intelligence for many years, and is the original proposer of the DIKWP model and an internationally recognized leader in this field. The DIKWP model and its extension (including the \"dual circulation\" artificial consciousness architecture) have obtained 114 authorized invention patents at home and abroad, forming a complete intellectual property system, which fully proves its scientific innovation and feasibility. In particular, the DIKWP mesh cognitive model described in the patent has been verified by many cases, which can provide clear cognitive levels and transformation rules for large-scale AI systems, and provide an executable semantic framework for the development of artificial consciousness systems. These preliminary results show that it is technically feasible to construct an artificial awareness and cognitive assessment system with DIKWP as the core. In addition, the team has developed the DIKWP artificial consciousness prototype system, which has won the \"Best Poster Award\" at a recent academic conference. For example, we have successfully implemented the \"Purpose-Driven DIKWP Physiological Artificial Consciousness Prototype\", which initially demonstrates the effect of embedding the Purpose layer into an artificial intelligence body to produce self-regulating behavior. These advances have laid the foundation for the construction of more complex artificial consciousness simulations and cognitive models for this project.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of multidisciplinary development, the key technical routes on which this project is based have made important breakthroughs in their respective fields, and have the conditions for integrated innovation. On the one hand, the fields of brain science and cognitive science have accumulated a large number of multi-scale data and theoretical models for autism, ADHD and other diseases, such as candidate genes found in genome association studies, functional network abnormalities revealed by brain imaging studies, and executive function deficit hypotheses proposed by cognitive psychology. On the other hand, recent advances in artificial intelligence and data science have enabled us to integrate and analyze these heterogeneous data – deep learning and network analytics techniques can be used to mine potential correlational patterns in multidimensional data and build models of complex systems. In recent years, the research on artificial consciousness has developed rapidly in the world, and some preliminary models have been able to simulate human perception and some cognitive functions. Virtual reality and human-computer interaction technologies are also becoming more and more mature, and have been applied to the social training of children with autism and have achieved results. It can be said that the DIKWP cognitive model, artificial consciousness simulation, multimodal data fusion, intelligent decision-making and digital rehabilitation involved in this project have a good foundation in their respective fields, and our team has the conditions to organically combine them to produce a \"1+1&gt;2\" synergistic effect. In particular, the introduction of the DIKWP framework is expected to become a link to integrate knowledge from various fields, connect biology and cognitive disciplines, reduce the uncertainty of research, and improve the probability of success.</p>\n<p><strong>Research team and supporting conditions: This project is undertaken by a multidisciplinary high-level team, and the core members have rich research experience and outstanding achievements in artificial intelligence, brain science, biomedical engineering, etc. The project leader, Professor Yucong Duan, is also an academician of the International Academy of Advanced Technology and Engineering and the chairman of the World Association of Artificial Consciousness, and has made great achievements in the research of basic theories and cognitive models of artificial intelligence. Many of the project backbones come from the fields of neurobiology, psychiatry, clinical and computer science, and have participated in national key R&amp;D programs and major projects, and have a deep understanding of the mechanism of brain development diseases and AI medical technology. The team has all the key technologies needed to carry out this project</strong>, including cognitive model construction, machine learning, big data processing, brain imaging analysis, animal experiments and clinical trial design. In terms of research conditions, the relying unit has established scientific research platforms such as \"Artificial Consciousness and Cognitive Intelligence Laboratory\" and \"Multimodal Brain Imaging Center\", equipped with high-performance computing clusters, virtual reality equipment, neural signal recording analyzers and other hardware, which can fully meet the needs of model simulation and data processing. We have partnerships with hospitals and rehabilitation centers to obtain clinical samples and conduct preclinical studies. At the same time, existing patents and software achievements will be seamlessly used in this project, speeding up the research and development process. In addition, the project team has an extensive academic cooperation network at home and abroad, and can consult experts in related fields at any time to carry out collaborative research. All these ensure the feasibility and efficient progress of the project implementation.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk analysis and response: This project is cutting-edge and innovative, involving multidisciplinary interdisciplinarity, and potential challenges include: the complexity of the model may bring difficulty to analysis, some hypotheses are difficult to verify, and the regulatory and ethical considerations in the process of clinical translation. In this regard, we have formulated a plan: in the model design, adhere to modular, gradual development, if the global model is too complex and difficult to converge, we will simplify the sub-model and gradually superimpose; In terms of verification, if a hypothesis cannot be verified by conventional experiments, we will seek alternative experimental paradigms or use cooperative team resources. For clinical application approval and ethics, we will communicate with regulatory authorities and ethics experts early in the development process to ensure that the product design meets specifications and strictly adheres to the protection of subject rights and interests during the validation phase. It is worth mentioning that because this project conducts a large number of simulation experiments in a virtual environment</strong>, the risk and cost of real-world experiments can be reduced to a large extent. On the whole, the project is bold in innovation but well-thought-out in its plans, with controllable risks and multiple response paths, which has high implementation feasibility.</p>\n<h1 id=\"5-Phased-achievements-and-assessment-indicators\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#5-Phased-achievements-and-assessment-indicators\" title=\"5. Phased achievements and assessment indicators\"></a><strong>5. Phased achievements and assessment indicators</strong></h1><p>In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the project, we plan to divide the entire research plan into three phases, and the key tasks and assessment indicators of each stage are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Phase 1 (initial stage of the project, 1~2 years): model construction and basic platform construction. Complete the construction and optimization of the DIKWP×DIKWP unified cognitive model, build a basic platform for artificial consciousness simulation, and realize the simulation of normal people with at least one typical cognitive task; Establish a multimodal database of brain development diseases and a hierarchical evaluation index system of DIKWP; The prototype of intelligent auxiliary diagnosis algorithm was developed. <em>Assessment indicators</em>: submit DIKWP× DIKWP model formal description and software module, the model can reproduce the basic cognitive behavior of normal people; The database covers multi-layer data of no less than 100 samples; The accuracy of the auxiliary diagnostic model for the classification of patients in the training set ≥ 85%. At least 2 papers published in the stage (including 1 SCI journal paper); The stage summary report passed the expert review.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Phase 2 (mid-project, 3~4 years): mechanism validation and target screening.

Complete the initial validation of at least 1 intervention in an animal model and observe changes in efficacy in the expected direction; The digital rehabilitation prototype system has complete functions, no major software defects, and positive feedback from small-scale trials. Published 2~3 papers and applied for more than 1 Chinese invention patent; The mid-term inspection passed.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Phase 3 (late project, 5th year): Comprehensive integration and validation evaluation. Integrate the results of each module and improve the decision-making system for diagnosis and treatment driven by artificial awareness; For the most promising 1~2 intervention programs, in-depth animal experiment verification (including multi-index evaluation of behavior and pathophysiology) was completed, and statistically significant efficacy improvement results were obtained. Conduct controlled trials of digital rehabilitation systems in target patient populations to evaluate their clinical benefits; Organize and form research reports and technical specifications on the mechanism and diagnosis and treatment strategies of brain development diseases, and plan clinical transformation. <em>Assessment indicators</em>: The integrated diagnosis and treatment decision-making system can give personalized intervention suggestions based on patient data, and the effectiveness of the recommendations is verified in the simulation test (compared with the unoptimized program, the cognitive improvement predicted by the model is increased by &gt;20%); In animal experiments, the core symptom indicators of the intervention group were significantly improved compared with the model group (P&lt;0.05). In the rehabilitation system trial with no less than 10 patients, the response rate (the proportion of symptom scale score improvement reaching the predetermined standard) was not less than 70%, and no serious adverse events were reported; Form 1 copy of the general project report and 1 copy of the standardized technical manual; Published more than 2 papers (including 1 SCI Zone 2 or above paper) and applied for 1 related international patent; All the acceptance indicators of the project were achieved, and the final acceptance was passed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"6-Clinical-transformation-and-promotion-paths\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#6-Clinical-transformation-and-promotion-paths\" title=\"6. Clinical transformation and promotion paths\"></a><strong>6. Clinical transformation and promotion paths</strong></h1><p>The ultimate goal of this project is to apply the research results to clinical practice for the benefit of the majority of patients with developmental disabilities. To this end, we have developed a clear clinical translation and promotion plan:</p>\n<p>First of all, in terms of diagnostic evaluation technology, the DIKWP multi-layer evaluation framework and intelligent diagnostic system developed in this project will enter the clinical verification stage in the later stage of the project. Once its effectiveness is verified to be superior to existing diagnostic methods, we will collaborate with children's hospitals and psychiatric hospitals to conduct multi-center clinical trials to collect data from larger samples to verify stability. At the same time, it is preparing to apply for national medical device approval, and the diagnostic system will be registered and certified as an auxiliary diagnostic software (Software as a Medical Device, SaMD). At the promotion level, we plan to promote this new assessment system to psychiatrists and clinical psychologists through academic conferences and continuing education, and to develop user manuals and training materials to ensure that clinicians can master its use. Relying on the team's influence in the domestic artificial intelligence medical field, we will actively strive to incorporate relevant indicators into clinical diagnosis and treatment guidelines or expert consensus, so as to improve industry recognition.</p>\n<p>Second, in terms of therapeutic targets and intervention programs, we will cooperate with biopharmaceutical companies and clinical research institutions to advance the drug development or clinical trial process for the selected new drugs or gene targets. If it is a new indication (retargeting drug) of an existing marketed drug, the design of a phase II clinical validation trial will be initiated; For new drugs with a new mechanism, we will consider optimizing the drug lead compound, pharmacological and toxicological evaluation, and then applying for IND approval. Gene and cell therapy targets are further validated in larger animal models in collaboration with gene therapy companies or stem cell centers, and then applied for clinical trials after maturity. We plan to bring at least one new therapy into clinical trials within 3-5 years of the end of the program. At the same time, non-invasive physical and digital intervention programs (e.g., brain stimulation, digital rehabilitation training) will enter clinical translation earlier. We will complete the preliminary clinical trial data during the project period and apply for approval from the relevant competent authorities to market the digital rehabilitation system as a medical device or digital therapeutics. The success of Akili's approval of play therapies shows that regulators are embracing this form of digital intervention. We will also refer to its path to ensure that the product meets security and privacy specifications and is approved for registration.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, in terms of the promotion and application of the digital rehabilitation platform, we plan to adopt a multi-channel strategy. In addition to being used as a prescription rehabilitation tool in the medical system, we will also cooperate with special education schools and rehabilitation training institutions to promote the system, so that more children with developmental disabilities can use the system in their daily training. In order to lower the barrier to use, we will develop a version that adapts to a variety of terminals (tablets, PCs, VR devices), and launch a cloud service model for access in under-resourced areas. The project team will hold a demonstration training course to train a group of therapists and teachers who have mastered the digital rehabilitation system as \"seed users\", so as to expand the application from point to point. Considering the large base of children with developmental disabilities in China and the significant regional differences, we also plan to cooperate with public welfare foundations to carry out charitable donations or pilot applications in some underdeveloped areas to verify the large-scale feasibility and effect of this system in a real environment. Once it proves to have significant social benefits, we will actively propose to the National Health Commission and other competent authorities to include digital rehabilitation in the scope of national rehabilitation plans and medical insurance payments, and further promote its popularization.</p>\n<p>Finally, in terms of industrial transformation and continuous R&amp;D, relying on the results of this project, we have the conditions to incubate specialized high-tech enterprises or cooperate deeply with existing medical AI companies to build scientific research prototypes into stable commercial products. The team's rich patent reserves and technical secrets will play a key role in the industrialization process. We will formulate a clear intellectual property sharing and licensing policy to protect the interests of our partners and promote a win-win situation for industry, academia and research. After industrialization, more resources will be invested through the market mechanism to continuously improve product functions and upgrade the version according to clinical feedback. For example, we will continue to expand the training content library, optimize artificial intelligence algorithms, and increase support for other related diseases (such as depression and anxiety with developmental disabilities) to expand the applicability of products. In terms of promoting internationalization, we plan to cooperate with well-known foreign research institutions and autism organizations to promote this achievement to the world. In terms of academic communication, through publishing high-level papers and participating in international conferences, we will improve China's influence in the intersection of artificial consciousness and brain diseases, and export the \"China Plan\".</p>\n<p>In short, while completing the scientific research goals, this project will closely focus on clinical needs and open up a one-kilometer road from laboratory to clinic. Through the above-mentioned multi-level and multi-path transformation and promotion measures, we strive to make our theoretical and technical achievements truly applied to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with autism and ADHD within a few years after the end of the project, improve the diagnostic efficiency and intervention effect, reduce the burden on patients' families and society, and produce significant social and economic benefits. We believe that the successful implementation and transformation of this project will contribute to the solution of the global problem of brain development diseases, and lead a new direction for the deep integration of artificial intelligence and brain science.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

Background and significance\"></a><strong>1. Background and significance</strong></h1><p>Cognitive impairment neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, etc.) are one of the major medical and social challenges facing the world and China. These diseases are characterized by high incidence, irreversible progression of the disease course, and heavy burden of care. According to statistics, there are currently more than 16 million dementia patients in China, and it is expected to increase to about 115 million in 2050, ranking first in the world. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of cognitive impairment dementia, characterized by progressive memory loss and deterioration of overall cognitive function. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is more common in younger people, and is prominently manifested by personality and behavior changes, language impairment, etc. These diseases not only seriously affect the quality of life of patients, but also bring a heavy burden to families and society, so it is of great significance to study their pathogenesis and explore effective diagnosis and treatment strategies.</p>\n<p>The pathological mechanisms of cognitive impairment neurodegenerative diseases are extremely complex. Taking AD as an example, the pathogenesis of AD is thought to be the result of the long-term accumulation of a variety of harmful factors, including amyloid plaque deposition, abnormal phosphorylation of Tau protein to form neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic and neuronal loss, neuroinflammatory responses, and brain metabolic disorders. At the cellular and molecular levels, the neuronal microenvironment of AD brain has problems such as abnormal energy metabolism, decreased glucose utilization, and lipid metabolism disorders, resulting in impaired neural network activity, decreased plasticity, and accelerated deposition of pathological products. The loss of synaptic connections is the direct anatomical basis of cognitive impairment in AD, and the extent of which is highly correlated with dementia severity. Studies have shown that synaptic loss is an early feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, and is the main pathological change associated with cognitive dysfunction. The occurrence of synaptic dysfunction is closely related to the abnormal activity of glial cells (microglia and astrocytes): activated glial cells mediate excessive synaptic phagocytosis and pruning, resulting in an imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission and exacerbating network dysfunction. In addition, the metabolic imbalance between the brain and the periphery is also an important factor, such as the significant reduction of glucose and oxygen consumption in the brain and the impaired insulin signaling in AD patients, which is vividly called \"type III diabetes of the brain\". Systemic metabolic disorders (such as abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism, iron ion imbalance, etc.) can affect the central nervous system through the blood-brain barrier and neuroendocrine pathways, accelerating neurodegenerative changes. In contrast, the pathological mechanism of FTD varies according to different pathological types (such as Tau proteinopathy, TDP-43 proteinopathy, etc.), showing a high degree of genetic and pathological heterogeneity. The clinical manifestations of FTD patients are varied, ranging from loss of behavioral inhibition and impulsivity to progressive decline in language function, and even members of the same family with the same mutation may have very different clinical manifestations. Due to the complex diversity of phenotypes and mechanisms, the pathogenesis of cognitive degenerative diseases is far from being fully elucidated.</p>\n<p>In clinical practice, the current diagnosis and treatment methods for cognitive degenerative diseases are still very limited. There is no cure for AD and FTD, and existing drugs (such as cholinesterase inhibitors, donepezil, memantine, etc.) can only alleviate symptoms to a certain extent, but cannot prevent disease progression. Even newly approved immunotherapies for AD amyloid (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) only delay the course of the disease, have limited effect on cognitive impairment that has already occurred, and have safety concerns. A common difficulty in these disorders is the insidious onset, the lack of specific symptoms in the early stages, and the widespread irreversible damage to the brain by the time the clinical diagnosis is made. For example, pathological changes in the brain of AD patients may begin to accumulate 20 years before cognitive symptoms appear. In the early stages of FTD, it is often misdiagnosed as psychiatric illness or depression, and the intervention window is missed. Due to the lack of sensitive and reliable early biomarkers and screening methods, the clinical identification of high-risk individuals (such as patients with mild cognitive impairment and MCI) and the timing of intervention are insufficient. At the same time, the current assessment of cognitive function mainly relies on scales such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and neuropsychological tests, which have limited ability to detect impairments in high-level cognitive functions (such as executive function, insight, and purpose planning), and often focus on low- and middle-level functions such as memory and language. However, higher-order functional disorders, such as lack of self-awareness and reduced behavioral purposefulness, lack quantitative indicators in traditional assessments, so clinical identification and targeted treatment are insufficient. As a result, although some patients have no obvious memory impairment, their \"wisdom\" and \"purpose\" functions such as decision-making ability and social cognition have been significantly reduced, but they have not been paid attention to in time, which has missed the opportunity for intervention.</p>\n<p>In the face of the above challenges, it is necessary to explore new theoretical frameworks and technical means to systematically analyze the whole chain evolution mechanism of cognitive degenerative diseases from molecular pathology to high-level cognitive functions, so as to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. <strong>The Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom-Purpose (DIKWP) model provides an innovative perspective for this.</strong> The DIKWP model is an artificial consciousness cognitive framework originally created by Professor Yucong Duan's team, which adds the highest level of \"Purpose/Intention\" to the classic DIKW (Pyramid) model (Data–Information–Knowledge–Wisdom).<strong>Dimension. The model believes that there are five layers of abstract semantic hierarchy in the cognitive system, from data to information, to knowledge, Wisdom, to Purpose, and that the transmission between each level is not simple, but through the network structure to achieve two-way feedback and iterative update. That is to say, the low-level perceptual data is extracted into information, further integrated to form knowledge, and then elevated to wisdom through experience and judgment, and finally guided by wisdom to form the purpose and purpose of action. In turn, the purpose and purpose of the higher level play a guiding and constraining role in the information processing and knowledge application of the lower level.</strong> The introduction of the \"Purpose\" layer is the key innovation of the model, which acts as the \"North Star\" of the entire cognitive chain, ensuring that cognitive activities are clearly goal-oriented. The DIKWP model establishes a unified cognitive semantic language that enables every step of complex cognitive processes to be parsed and understood. This model framework was originally applied to the field of artificial intelligence, providing a new way to solve the \"black box\" problem of large-scale pre-trained models and improve the interpretability of AI systems. By embedding a \"purpose\" layer inside the model and making the process traceable at each level, DIKWP makes the AI decision-making process transparent, so that every step of the reasoning is well documented. It is worth noting that the DIKWP model is essentially a general cognitive structure abstraction, which is equally applicable to the description and analysis of human cognitive processes. Therefore, the introduction of the DIKWP model into the study of neurodegenerative cognitive disorders is expected to transform the data from <strong>data-information-knowledge-wisdom-purpose</strong> For example, AD patients have a decrease in information processing speed and difficulty in acquiring knowledge (corresponding to information and knowledge barriers) in the early stage, a decrease in judgment and problem-solving ability in the middle stage (Wisdom layer disorder), and a late loss of life goals and autonomous behavior motivation (Purpose layer disorder). This DIKWP-based cognitive degradation profile will be more comprehensive than the traditional memory-executive function division, which can capture the subtle changes of higher-order cognitive function degeneration and provide new clues for identifying early abnormalities.</p>\n<p>At the same time, from the <strong>perspective of Artificial Consciousness theory, it also brings innovative value to the understanding and intervention of advanced functional disorders of such diseases. Dementia is not only a loss of memory, but also involves a decline in the level of consciousness</strong>: patients often have reduced self-awareness, empathy, and lack of behavioral purpose, which can be regarded as manifestations of impaired human consciousness. If we think of the brain as a system of information processing and consciousness formation, then neurodegenerative diseases can be seen as the system that produces local or global dysfunction, resulting in a decrease in the ability to \"quasi-conscious\". Most of the existing studies explain the symptoms at the molecular and network levels, but lack the discussion on the phenomenological aspects of consciousness. The introduction of artificial consciousness theory can help build bridges from neural mechanisms to conscious experience. For example, drawing on consciousness frameworks such as Global Workspace Theory (GWT) or Integrated Information Theory (IIT), it is possible to re-understand why AD patients gradually lose integrated cognition of the environment and self, and why FTD patients lack awareness of their own lesions (anosognosia). The DIKWP artificial consciousness model proposed by Professor Yucong Duan itself integrates the ideas of multiple mainstream consciousness theories, and simulates the cognitive flow and self-regulation mechanism of human consciousness through a five-layer framework and a \"dual circulation\" structure. The application of this model to the patient's brain is expected to elucidate the disintegration process of higher-order cognitive functions (such as decision-making purpose and value judgment), and clarify the association between these higher-order dysfunctions and underlying neuropathology. This has important implications for the development of targeted interventions, such as the Purpose Drive that stimulates patient retention.</p>\n<p>In summary, this study takes \"pathological mechanisms and novel diagnosis and treatment strategies of neurodegenerative diseases with cognitive impairment\" <strong>as the core proposition, and takes the DIKWP model and artificial consciousness theory as the core theoretical support, aiming to open up the research chain from molecular pathology to advanced cognition. On the one hand, the DIKWP framework system was used to characterize the degeneration trajectory of patients' cognitive function at the levels of data, information, knowledge,</strong> wisdom and purpose, and to reveal the dynamic change law of the whole cognitive chain with the evolution of the disease. On the other hand, from the perspective of artificial consciousness, we can grasp the barriers of higher-order functions (such as self-awareness, purpose-driven, etc.) that cannot be fully quantified by traditional methods, and design innovative evaluation indicators and intervention strategies for these aspects. Through the in-depth intersection of basic mechanism research and artificial intelligence technology, this project will provide new ideas and means to solve the mechanism problems of such diseases and explore new diagnosis and treatment options, which has great scientific significance and application value.</p>\n<h1 id=\"2-Research-objectives-and-overall-technical-roadmap\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-Research-objectives-and-overall-technical-roadmap\" title=\"2. Research objectives and overall technical roadmap\"></a><strong>2. Research objectives and overall technical roadmap</strong></h1><p><strong>The overall goal of the research is to systematically study the mechanism and relationship of functional deterioration at each level around the five-layer cognitive structure proposed by the DIKWP model for cognitive degenerative diseases, establish a new hierarchical diagnosis and evaluation system</strong>, and develop a consciousness-like assisted diagnosis and treatment strategy combining biology and artificial intelligence. Specifically, the objectives of this project include: (1) Revealing data, information, knowledge, <strong>wisdom, and purpose</strong> Under the five-layer framework, the degradation mechanisms and mutual influences of each level in the progression process of cognitive impairment were clarified, and the key pathological links and potential intervention targets were clarified. (2) Construct a hierarchical evaluation index system and quantitative model of cognitive function based on DIKWP to achieve fine representation and early warning of patients' cognitive status; (3) develop AI-driven intelligent assessment and diagnosis tools, using machine learning to fuse multimodal data to improve the detection rate and diagnostic accuracy of early cognitive abnormalities (especially the decline in higher-order wisdom function and consciousness level); (4) Propose and validate new cognitive intervention strategies from the perspective of consciousness, and design training programs that can activate the functions of patients' Wisdom and Purpose layers; (5) Integrate the above results to develop a consciousness-inspired cognitive rehabilitation system, which can be used to assist clinical cognitive training and home rehabilitation of patients, and ultimately improve the quality of life of patients.</p>\n<p>Overall technical route: This project adopts the route of \"basic mechanism research-cognitive modeling-technology development-system integration\", which is promoted layer by layer from bottom to top, and at the same time, the DIKWP theory runs through the whole process, integrating multidisciplinary methods. The technical route is generally divided into five links, which are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Multimodal Neurobiological Mechanisms Study</strong> →</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Cognitive layer degradation modeling based on DIKWP</strong> →</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>DIKWP Structured Cognitive Assessment Tool Development</strong> →</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Class awareness-based intervention program design</strong> →</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Intelligent cognitive rehabilitation system integration</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>First, through multimodal neurological and molecular biology studies, abnormal changes in neurons, synapses, glia, metabolism and other aspects of diseases are obtained, so as to provide a biological basis for cognitive models; Secondly, the above findings were integrated into the cognitive framework of DIKWP to establish a model of disease cognitive function deterioration, and to clarify the mapping relationship between functional impairment and biological mechanism at each level. Then, guided by the model, hierarchical evaluation indicators and methods were designed, and AI-driven evaluation tools were developed to achieve comprehensive quantitative assessment and intelligent diagnosis of patients' cognitive status. Then, based on the DIKWP model, the intervention ideas were proposed, and the training methods and class awareness aids that could stimulate the ability of the patients' Wisdom/Purpose layer were designed. Finally, the evaluation and intervention module is integrated into an intelligent rehabilitation system that combines software and hardware, and verified and optimized in real scenarios. The above technical roadmap covers the complete process from mechanism exploration to application transformation, ensuring that the research results can be closed-loop verification, gradual iteration, and finally application. The details of each phase and key technical solutions are described in detail below.</p>\n<h1 id=\"3-Research-content-and-technical-route\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-Research-content-and-technical-route\" title=\"3. Research content and technical route\"></a><strong>3. Research content and technical route</strong></h1><p><strong>3.1 Neuromolecular mechanisms and brain microenvironment</strong></p>\n<p>The first part of this study focuses on the neurobiological basis of cognitive impairment degenerative diseases, aiming to elucidate the neuromolecular mechanisms and changes in the brain microenvironment underlying the deterioration of various layers of cognitive function. We will conduct in-depth research in three key areas: synaptic function, glial cells, and <strong>brain-body metabolism</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Synaptic Injury and Altered Network Connectivity: Synapses are the basic units of neural information transmission, and their structural and functional integrity are critical to cognitive processes. Numerous studies have shown that synaptic loss and dysfunction are highly correlated with cognitive decline and are the most important anatomical basis in the pathogenesis of dementia such as AD. In this project, we will use brain histopathology, animal models, and neuroimaging to detect changes in synaptic density and plasticity in the early and advanced stages of the disease, with a particular focus on synaptic plasticity decline in cognitively relevant brain regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. At the same time, super-resolution imaging, electrophysiological recording and other techniques were used to study the abnormalities of presynaptic and postsynaptic elements (such as neurotransmitter release of presynaptic neurons, postsynaptic dendritic spine density and receptor expression), and the effects of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic dysbalance on neural network dynamics were investigated. We hypothesize that the loss of synaptic connections first affects the processing efficiency of the data layer and the information layer in the DIKWP model, because sensory input and primary information processing depend on intact synaptic networks; As synaptic lesions expand, knowledge acquisition and integration (knowledge layer</strong>) and further impact Wisdom decision-making ability ( <strong>Wisdom layer</strong>). Through synaptic pathology studies, we will identify synaptic structural/functional indicators that are closely related to dysfunction in various layers of cognition and screen for possible targets for intervention (e.g., synaptic plasticity-related proteins).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Glia and neuroinflammation: Microglia and astrocytes, among others, form the \"helper\" networks in the brain, but in neurodegenerative diseases, they often go from being supporters to destroyers. Microglia overactivation and astrocyte dysplasia are often seen in the brain of AD and FTD patients, accompanied by a chronic inflammatory environment. These glial changes are strongly associated with synaptic injury: activated microglia can engulf synapses through the complement pathway, and astrocyte dysfunction affects neuronal metabolic supply and ion homeostasis. In this study, immunohistochemistry and single-cell sequencing were used to analyze the changes in glial cell morphology and gene expression profiles in the brains of patients and model animals. The phagocytic activity of microglia</strong>, the secretion of inflammatory factors, and the nutritional support function of astrocytes in the course of the disease were investigated. We will elucidate the link between glial-mediated chronic inflammation and <strong>cognitive impairment at the Wisdom/Purpose level: for example, does excessive clearance of synapses by microglia lead to disconnection of higher cognitive circuits? Does the reduced support of astroglia for presynaptic terminals impair the ability to process complex information? Through longitudinal monitoring of the brain microenvironment, we hope to identify several neuro-immune regulatory pathways</strong> as intervention entry points to delay cognitive degeneration. Novel glial-related biomarkers, such as inflammatory factors or glial-derived proteins in plasma/cerebrospinal fluid, will also be explored in the study to inform early diagnosis.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Mechanisms of Brain-Body Metabolic Imbalances: There is growing evidence that neurodegenerative cognitive impairment is strongly associated with systemic metabolic health. For example, patients with AD often have systemic metabolic problems such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and decreased cerebral glucose utilization. The energy crisis in the brain can directly impair the function of neurons and accelerate the accumulation of pathological products, thus forming a vicious circle. In this study, brain imaging (such as FDG-PET to detect brain glucose metabolism), peripheral metabolic index monitoring (glucose tolerance, blood lipids, inflammatory mediators) and metabolomics analysis will be used to comprehensively evaluate the brain-body metabolic status of patients. We focus on how impaired neuronal energy metabolism</strong> (decreased mitochondrial function and ATP production) affects the efficiency of information processing and knowledge acquisition in cognitive processes, as well as the chronic damage to the brain caused by peripheral metabolic disorders (such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia) through vascular and inflammatory pathways. Based on these data, we will construct a <strong>metabolic-cognitive correlation map</strong> of disease and identify metabolic factors that are significantly associated with the rate of cognitive decline. For example, the presence or absence of changes in the levels of certain metabolites predicts the shift in cognition from mild impairment to dementia. For the discovery of important metabolic pathways, we will also conduct intervention experiments (such as diet control, exercise training, or metabolic drug interventions) in animal models to verify whether improving systemic metabolism can help maintain cognitive function. This part of the study will provide a mechanism for non-pharmacological intervention strategies (e.g., exercise therapy, dietary modification) for cognitive impairment.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Through the above multimodal mechanism research, we try to elucidate the biological causes of the degradation of cognitive function at different levels of \"molecular-cellular-network-holistic\". <strong>Expected Results: Identify at least 2-3 key pathological mechanisms or targets</strong> (e.g., specific synaptic proteins, glial pathways, or metabolic factors) and explain their causal relationship with cognitive impairment. These mechanistic discoveries will not only enrich the understanding of disease occurrence and progression, but also provide scientific support for subsequent cognitive modeling and intervention design. The data obtained from mechanistic studies (including pathological indicators, molecular markers, etc.) will be used as input to the cognitive model of DIKWP, so that the model has a solid biological foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>3.2 DIKWP model-driven cognitive layer degradation modeling</strong></p>\n<p>After grasping the important neurobiological changes of the disease, the second part of the study will construct a theoretical model of cognitive deterioration driven by the DIKWP model to explain and simulate the full-chain decline of cognitive function with the progression of pathology. Based on the DIKWP artificial consciousness framework proposed by Professor Yucong Duan, the model maps the biological abnormalities found in the previous section to various abstract levels of the cognitive system, so as to reveal the characteristics and internal connections of diseases at different cognitive levels.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we will first define the meaning of the five levels of DIKWP in the context of disease cognition:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Data: Refers to the primitive sensory input received by the brain and the neural signals generated. In a healthy state, the data layer includes the normal acquisition of sensory information such as vision, hearing, and touch, as well as neuronal firing patterns. In disease states, the data layer may involve decreased sensory function (e.g., audiovisual and visual impairment) as well as abnormalities in neuronal firing (e.g., epileptic firing or diminished resting-state functional connectivity of neural networks). The compromise of the data layer will directly affect the quality of information extraction.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Information layer: Refers to the representation of raw data after it has been interpreted, filtered, and encoded. In cognitive processes, it is equivalent to attention selection, retrieval of meaningful signals, and temporal storage of working memory. Disorders may lead to reduced function of the information layer, such as difficulty concentrating, decreased working memory capacity, and slower processing of information from complex environments. These changes are often the source of early subjective cognitive difficulties.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Knowledge: refers to the semantic network, factual knowledge and skill reserve formed through learning and memory. Under normal circumstances, individuals are constantly integrating new information into existing knowledge structures. The typical effects of disorders such as AD on the knowledge layer are memory loss, difficulty learning new things, and loss of semantic knowledge (e.g., language disorder). Patients with FTD may also have difficulties in semantic comprehension at the knowledge level. The degradation of the knowledge layer directly corresponds to the symptoms of forgetfulness and the difficulty in applying knowledge seen in clinical practice.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Wisdom: refers to the ability to understand, judge, synthesize, and innovate on the basis of mastered knowledge, including higher-order cognitive functions such as abstract thinking, decision-making and planning, problem solving, and situational response. The Wisdom layer is an individual's ability to apply knowledge to solve real-world problems and make informed decisions. In the process of dementia, the function of the wisdom layer gradually disintegrates, which is manifested as a decrease in judgment, a deterioration in the ability to solve daily problems, and difficulty in coping with new situations. In frontotemporal dementia in particular, loss of executive function and social cognition is an important manifestation of Wisdom layer disorder. Deficits at this level often affect the patient's ability to live independently earlier than memory problems.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Purpose Layer (Purpose/Intention): This is the highest layer that is particularly emphasized in the DIKWP model. It represents the motivation, goal, and will of the individual, i.e., the \"ultimate purpose of the service of the cognitive process\". The Purpose layer runs through and guides the activities of all levels below, which corresponds to the vision and direction of the entire cognitive system. Under normal circumstances, a clear purpose keeps our cognitive behavior centered around achieving a goal. In neurodegenerative diseases, the function of the Purpose layer is often overlooked but critical. For example, patients with advanced AD have</strong> apathy, loss of interest and initiative in any activity, which is typical of Purpose dysfunction; Patients with FTD may present with disturbances in purpose-directed behaviors, such as impulsive behaviors or repetitive stereotyped behaviors, reflecting impaired purpose-making mechanisms. The disintegration of the purpose layer means that the patient gradually loses the ability to self-drive behavior and the understanding of the purpose of his behavior, which eventually leads to the inability to take care of himself.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the above layers are defined, we will map the biological mechanisms to the cognitive level changes through theoretical analysis and modeling. This includes collating the important neuropathological events identified in Section 3.1 and classifying and mapping them to potentially affected links in each layer of the DIKWP. For example, reduced hippocampal synaptic density primarily affects knowledge layer (memory storage) ability, while frontal neural network disconnection and dopaminergic dysfunction may explain the Wisdom layer (executive function and motivation) disorders. We will use systems dynamics modeling or causal mapping to characterize the causal chain from molecular pathology to cognitive deterioration. In this process, the two-way feedback characteristics of the DIKWP model are introduced: not only how the pathology accumulates from the bottom up leads to cognitive decline, but also how the decrease in cognitive activity in turn accelerates physiological deterioration (e.g., the loss of the Purpose layer leads to passive inactivity, which in turn aggravates the decline of metabolism and brain function, and the vicious circle of \"use in and in waste\").</p>\n<p>In order to quantify the model, we will combine the actual data to estimate the modeling parameters. For example, the cognitive assessment scores (including memory, executive function scores, etc.) and the corresponding brain imaging and biomarker data were used to establish a correlation model between functional and pathological indicators at each layer in longitudinal follow-up. Structural equation model (<strong>SEM) or Bayesian network can be used to</strong> fit the pathway model of cognitive decline by using DIKWP layers as latent variables and pathological mechanism indicators as observation variables. This makes it possible to estimate the relative progress of degradation at each level and its contribution to the overall cognition. We will also try to construct a simplified cognitive system model (e.g., agent-based simulation) through computer simulation, assign it DIKWP structure, and introduce AD-like pathological parameters (such as reducing connection weights, increasing random noise, etc.) to observe the changes in system behavior to verify the rationality of the model.</p>\n<p>Through this module, we hope to obtain a comprehensive model that can explain the phenomenon of \"cognitive dimensionality reduction\" <strong>(that is, the loss of higher-order abilities such as Wisdom / Purpose, which gradually degenerates into only fragmented knowledge and even difficulty in processing basic information). This model will shed light on the differences in cognitive deterioration pathways that may exist between different patients: for example, some patients develop memory deficits first (knowledge level degenerates first), while others exhibit decreased judgment (</strong>). The Wisdom layer is damaged first), which may be related to differences in their pathological type or brain reserves. Models will also help predict disease progression: by observing changes in lower-level functions, it is possible to infer when there will be significant disintegration of high-level Wisdom and Purpose, so as to guide early clinical intervention. More importantly, the model will point out key turning points and weaknesses at all levels, providing a theoretical basis for us to design targeted assessments and interventions.</p>\n<p>Expected Results: <strong>This part will develop</strong> a theoretical framework and a preliminary mathematical model of the \"DIKWP Cognitive Degeneration Model\", and elucidate: (1) the mapping of the correspondence between biological pathology and cognitive function levels; (2) the initial sequence of cognitive degradation and the interaction mechanism of each cognitive layer; and (3) potentially modifiable links (e.g., the compensatory effect of strengthening a certain level of function on overall cognition). This lays the groundwork for the subsequent development of assessment tools and interventions that can be optimised for specific levels of functional impairment in an evidence-based manner.</p>\n<p><strong>3.3 Development of intelligent evaluation and early screening diagnostic tools</strong></p>\n<p>With the cognitive degeneration model, we will move on to the third part of the study: the development of intelligent cognitive impairment assessment and early screening and diagnosis tools based on the DIKWP hierarchical structure. The core idea is to combine traditional cognitive assessment methods with artificial intelligence technology, and use machine learning to extract subtle clues of \"early consciousness abnormality\" or \"wisdom function decline\" from multi-source data, so as to achieve sharper and more comprehensive detection than existing methods. Early and accurate assessment is essential for timely intervention and slowing the disease progression.</p>\n<p>The specific research content and technical route include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Design of DIKWP hierarchical evaluation indicator system: Based on the model established in Section 3.2, we will design the evaluation tasks and indicators covering each layer of DIKWP. Traditional scales focus on memory (knowledge layer) and orientation/language (information layer), while we will supplement the tests of the Wisdom and Purpose levels. For example, at the</strong> Wisdom layer, we can design test scenarios to examine the subject's comprehensive reasoning, planning, and problem-solving skills (e.g., having the patient complete a daily task plan that spans multiple steps, assessing their logic and co-ordination skills); At the Purpose layer, motivational questionnaires or behavioral observations can be used to quantify the intensity of the patient's willingness to actively plan activities and the frequency of goal-directed behaviors. In addition, the functions of the data layer and the information layer also need to be objectively evaluated, such as sensory impairment tests, simple reaction time tasks, attention span tests, etc. We will integrate these tests to form a DIKWP Cognitive Function Assessment Scale. The scale will be presented in modules, each corresponding to a level of DIKWP, so that the results of the assessment can depict the level at which the patient has major deficits. For example, a patient with a fair memory score but a low Wisdom score suggests that higher-order executive function impairment may precede memory impairment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Multimodal data collection and digital evaluation: In order to improve the objectivity and granularity of evaluation, we will introduce a variety of new digital technologies. First of all, the cognitive assessment software is used to implement the test on a tablet or computer, and the accurate data such as reaction time and accuracy are automatically recorded to reduce the error of manual scoring. Second, wearable devices are utilized to monitor behavioral and physiological signals related to cognition, such as gait and daily activity patterns (representing</strong> purpose-driven initiative), sleep quality (related to brain health), and changes in speech intonation (which may reflect language organization and emotional willingness). Studies have shown that non-invasive signals such as voice and gait contain cognitive health information that can be used for inexpensive and efficient screening. We will collect data on short free speech and gait walking in subjects, analyze the content coherence, complexity and emotional expression of speech through artificial intelligence, analyze the speed, stride length and stability of gait, and extract features reflecting cognitive status. For example, patients with early AD may have increased speech pauses and poor vocabulary, which can be detected by NLP algorithms. People with mild cognitive impairment have increased gait fluctuations when walking, which can also be captured by wearable devices. In addition, we consider the response of neurophysiological signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) or functional near-infrared imaging (fNIRS) in simple tasks to assess brain information processing efficiency and network connectivity. The acquisition of multimodal data will provide rich input for machine learning models and help improve the accuracy of evaluation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Machine Learning Model Extracts Early Marker Features: After obtaining the above multidimensional data, we will build a machine learning/deep learning model to mine the key feature combinations that best distinguish early patients from normal aging individuals. Since the DIKWP model provides theoretical guidance for our feature selection, we will classify features into the model according to the hierarchy (e.g., perception/reaction time as the data layer feature, memory score as the knowledge layer feature, complex task performance as the Wisdom layer feature, etc.). Initially, we will use supervised learning methods to train classification models (such as support vector machines, gradient boosting trees, deep neural networks, etc.) to determine whether subjects have mild cognitive dysfunction or early dementia tendencies. The model training will use the annotated datasets collected in this project (classification such as normal cognition,</strong> MCI, early AD, etc.), and be tuned through cross-validation. At the same time, we will also try unsupervised**/self-supervised methods to automatically learn latent representations from the data to spot patterns that are imperceptible to the human eye. For example, an autoencoder is used to fuse multimodal data, extract a low-dimensional representation, and then analyze the differences in the distribution of this representation among different populations. White-box AI diagnosis is also one of the features of this project, and we plan to use the structure of DIKWP to explain the model: for example, through hierarchical regression analysis, the importance of the characteristics of each DIKWP layer to the model output, so that doctors can understand the basis of model decision-making. This approach is similar to** the white-box approach adopted by Prof. Yucong Duan's team in AI model evaluation, which makes the AI cognition and decision-making process transparent. Eventually, we will form an intelligent early screening algorithm, whose inputs include scale scores, numerical behavioral parameters, physiological indicators, etc., and output them as an assessment report of the respondent's cognitive health status. For example, the report will give a quantitative score for each DIKWP level (similar to a \"data/information/knowledge/wisdom/purpose\" 5D radar chart), the degree of deviation relative to normal people of the same age, and an overall risk score. In this way, even the slightest high-level functional abnormality, such as the Wisdom layer or the Purpose layer score is lower than the normal range, our system can alert you early. This full-link evaluation system has been verified in the evaluation of model awareness level in the field of AI, and it has been proved that it can comprehensively analyze the cognitive ability structure of the tested object.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Early Screening and Clinical Validation: The evaluation tools developed need to be validated for validity and utility in real populations. We plan to work with hospitals and communities to conduct clinical trials on a certain scale. In memory clinics or geriatric units, we will evaluate older adults who come to the clinic complaining of memory/cognitive problems using the system, and a specialist will make a diagnosis based on current clinical criteria (gold standard, such as clinical diagnosis of MCI or mild dementia). By comparison, we can calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the system for MCI/early dementia</strong> and compare the performance with traditional scale screening (e.g., MoCA). Our goal is to significantly improve the detection rate of early anomalies and reduce missed and misdiagnosed. For example, the sensitivity of the system to MCI is expected to increase by at least 20% compared to MoCA, and the specificity will remain at a high level. In addition, we will test the system in cognitively normal older adults to assess their predictive ability by looking at the relationship between their assessment scores and cognitive outcomes at follow-up. If certain indicators (e.g., Wisdom tier score) are found to significantly predict the risk of cognitive decline over the next 2 years during cohort follow-up, this proves that our assessment system is forward-looking. Eventually, we will refine the human-machine interface and reporting format of the assessment tool to make it suitable for daily use by clinicians and primary care providers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expected Results: A prototype of an intelligent cognitive assessment system based on the DIKWP model was produced</strong>, including: (1) a set of DIKWP hierarchical cognitive assessment scales and task packages with reliability and validity; (2) The early screening AI model fused with multimodal data has reached a practical level in terms of area under the ROC curve (AUC) and other performance indicators; (3) the test in the clinical setting proved that the tool can significantly improve the sensitivity and accuracy of early diagnosis compared with traditional methods; and (4) the assessment report format and indicator interpretation manual, making it a generalizable application. This achievement will fill the gap in the current cognitive assessment in high-level functional testing, provide a white-box and digital decision support tool for clinical practice, and provide a quantitative basis for follow-up intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>3.4 Design of consciousness-assisted therapy systems</strong></p>\n<p>In the fourth part of the project, we will develop a consciousness-like assisted therapy system for disease intervention. Guided by the DIKWP model, the system helps delay <strong>cognitive decline and improve patients' ability to take care of themselves by activating the patient's residual Wisdom layer and Purpose layer functions, combined with artificial intelligence technology. Different from traditional cognitive training, which focuses on memory exercises, our strategy emphasizes the reconstruction of higher-order cognition and active consciousness, which is a new model of \"quasi-consciousness\" rehabilitation.</strong></p>\n<p>The main research contents and innovations are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Design of cognitive training tasks (Wisdom layer activation): According to the Wisdom layer function of DIKWP, we will design a series of training tasks to exercise the comprehensive cognitive ability of patients. These tasks go beyond simple memorization and involve more reasoning, planning, and problem solving. For example, you can design a scenario simulation task</strong>: give the patient a daily life situation (e.g., planning a shopping trip, preparing a meal) and ask them to list the steps to deal with the changes and problems that arise along the way. This training is designed to stimulate the patient's brain to execute the network, exercising logical reasoning and adaptability. Strategy games and puzzles (puzzles, Sudoku, etc.) can improve the ability to think abstractly and pay attention. Studies have shown that regular cognitive training can improve memory and executive function in people with mild to moderate dementia. We will present these trainings in a gamified format to make them more fun and engaging. Each task will be combined with a quantitative assessment to monitor the patient's performance progress, allowing for individualized adjustment of the training difficulty.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Motivational Guidance and Purpose Layer Activation: In view of the common lack of motivation and depression and apathy of patients, we will introduce elements of motivational stimulation and meaning therapy to help patients rebuild their sense of purpose in life. On the one hand, the system will set up a goal management module: for example, guide patients to set daily</strong>/weekly small goals (such as tidying up the room, talking to friends), and give reminders and feedback, so that patients can gradually develop the habit of active planning. By breaking down \"big goals\" into \"small tasks\", patients can regain a sense of control and accomplishment. On the other hand, we draw on life review therapy in psychology, allowing patients to recall life stories and refine positive emotions through multimedia interaction, and find the meaning of continuous efforts from past experiences. These processes help activate the remaining spark in the patient's sense of self and rekindle interest in social interactions and activities. In addition, we plan to use social robots or virtual assistants to interact with patients and provide them with emotional support and companionship. Studies have shown that virtual peers with personality traits can reduce loneliness and apathy in people with dementia, encouraging them to communicate and be more active. Our system will implement an AI assistant with simple conversation and emotion recognition capabilities, which will talk to patients on a regular basis to understand their emotional state and encourage participation in training. This human-computer interaction attempts to simulate social interaction and has a positive effect on maintaining the patient's mental activity.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Virtual Reality and Multi-Sensory Stimulation: In order to enhance the training effect and fun, we will introduce virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies to build immersive cognitive training scenarios. For example, develop a VR home living environment in which patients are required to complete a series of daily tasks (finding objects, cooking, etc.) to exercise their multi-step execution and spatial memory skills. The immersion of VR can stimulate the multi-sensory pathways of the patient's brain and enhance the learning effect, and some studies have confirmed that VR intervention can improve the cognitive and motor function of the elderly with mild cognitive impairment. In addition, sensory stimulation therapies such as music and light stimulation (such as playing familiar songs with image recall) are combined to activate brain networks at multiple levels. These multi-sensory inputs enrich the stimuli at the data and information layers in the DIKWP framework, helping to lay the foundation for higher-level cognitive training.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Human-Computer Interaction and Biofeedback: Our quasi-consciousness rehabilitation system will focus on the friendliness and intelligent adjustment of human-computer interaction. On the one hand, through the large screen, tablet or VR equipment to provide an intuitive interface, patients can simply operate or voice commands to interact with the system; On the other hand, we collect various data from the training process, such as the patient's facial expressions and voice (reflecting emotional engagement), heart rate, and physiological indicators such as electrodermal energy (reflecting the level of concentration and relaxation). Using this feedback, the system can adjust the pace and content of the training in real time, for example by automatically reducing the difficulty of the task when fatigue is detected, or giving positive encouragement. Our goal is to create an adaptive learning system</strong> that adapts the protocol to the patient's condition to improve training effectiveness and adherence.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Integration and prototype implementation of rehabilitation system: The above sub-modules (cognitive training games, motivation guidance units, VR scenes, human-computer interfaces, etc.) will be integrated on a unified platform. We will develop a software prototype (which can run on a tablet or an all-in-one rehabilitation terminal) with the necessary hardware (e.g. VR glasses, wearable monitoring devices). The prototype system (tentatively named \"CogConscious\") will have features such as user management, training plan development, data logging and analysis, and more. To make it easier for healthcare professionals to use, we will design a management interface that allows you to browse patient training data, adjust intervention priorities, and link with assessment tools. For example, if the assessment results show that a patient has a low Wisdom tier score, the management recommends focusing on the corresponding training module. The entire system focuses on security and privacy protection, and conforms to medical AI system specifications.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Preliminary efficacy evaluation: We plan to carry out a small-sample efficacy observation study in the later stage of the project, select a certain number of patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment, and use this system for 6-12 months of intervention training, and the weekly training frequency and duration are determined according to individual tolerance. The control group was given conventional cognitive interventions (e.g., paper-and-pencil training or traditional rehabilitation instruction). We will compare changes in cognitive assessment scores, daily functioning scales, and behavioural symptoms (e.g. depression, apathy scores) between the two groups before and after the intervention. It is assumed that our class awareness intervention can achieve better results, such as a significant reduction in deterioration on the executive function test, a smaller decline in scores on the Life Independence Questionnaire, and even an improvement in some positive indicators. With special attention to</strong> metrics related to the Wisdom and Purpose levels, such as the number of patients' voluntary activities, willingness to actively communicate, etc., it is expected that the training group will outperform the control. This will validate the viability of our innovative intervention strategy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expected Result: Delivery of a prototype of a quasi-consciousness cognitive training and rehabilitation system</strong> and demonstration of its practical value in a small-scale trial. Specifically, it includes: (1) a set of training task sets and motivational stimulation programs for higher-order functions of dementia, which are scientific and operable as evaluated by experts; (2) System software prototype and hardware solution, verify usability through user testing; (3) preliminary clinical trial data showing the effect of cognitive training in maintaining or improving patients' cognitive function (e.g., the decline rate of memory and executive function in the 6-month training group was reduced by X% compared with that in the control group, and the quality of life score was improved); (4) At least 1-2 relevant research papers reporting the training program and test results. If the results are significant, we will lay the foundation for further large-scale validation and product rollout.</p>\n<h1 id=\"4-Feasibility-analysis\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-Feasibility-analysis\" title=\"4. Feasibility analysis\"></a><strong>4. Feasibility analysis</strong></h1><p>This project is led by Prof. Yucong Duan, whose team has deep research accumulation and unique advantages in the intersection of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, which provides a reliable guarantee for the smooth implementation of this research.</p>\n<p>First of all, the <strong>theoretical foundation is strong and the core technology is original.</strong> Professor Yucong Duan is an internationally renowned expert in the field of cognitive computing and artificial consciousness, and is currently an academician of the International Academy of Advanced Technology and Engineering, and the chairman of the World Association of Artificial Consciousness. He took the lead in proposing the DIKWP artificial consciousness model, which extended the Purpose layer on top of the classic DIKW framework to construct a network cognitive structure with two-way feedback. This theoretical system is an academic milestone and is considered to be one of the key paths to achieve strong artificial intelligence and artificial consciousness. What is even more commendable is that Professor Duan's team has put the DIKWP model into concrete implementation and obtained a series of independent intellectual property rights: up to now, the team has been authorized 114 invention patents (including 15 PCT international patents), covering many cutting-edge directions such as large model training, artificial consciousness construction, and cognitive operating system. These patented technologies have laid a solid technical reserve. In particular, in the area of explainable AI (white-box AI), the team used the DIKWP model to successfully design a method that makes the AI decision-making process transparent and controllable. For example, they propose to embed DIKWP into a large language model, decompose its reasoning into five links: data, information, knowledge, wisdom, and purpose, each step has a mathematical definition, and the model output can be supervised, so as to realize the semantic operating system prototype of the large model. This shows that the team has the ability to translate complex cognitive theory into engineering implementation, which is of great benefit to the development of interpretive diagnostic AI and transparent decision support system for this project.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the <strong>previous research results are rich and the multidisciplinary experience is rich</strong>. In recent years, Yucong Duan's team has produced a series of internationally leading results in artificial awareness and cognitive assessment. For example, the DIKWP white-box evaluation system led by it has become an innovative benchmark for the \"awareness level\" of evaluation models in the AI field: the \"Large Language Model Awareness Level \"Knowledge\" Quotient \"White-box DIKWP Evaluation Report\" released in 2025 builds a full-link evaluation system based on the DIKWP model, comprehensively quantifying the cognitive ability of mainstream large models from data, information, knowledge, wisdom, and purpose. The report shows that this system can deeply analyze the performance of modules such as perception, reasoning, problem solving, and purpose of the model, setting a new standard for AI cognitive evaluation. This result demonstrates the team's creativity in the cognitive assessment of complex systems and the ability to organize international collaborations (with the participation of more than 90 institutions around the world). This full-chain assessment concept will be directly borrowed from the development of human cognitive assessment in this project. In addition, in the medical field, the team has begun to explore the application of the DIKWP model: for example, the DIKWP artificial consciousness dialogue system has been developed in the intelligent medical consultation scenario, which can deeply understand the patient's description and give doctor-like consultation guidance (this study was published in a well-known academic forum and gained attention). In addition, the \"Purpose-driven DIKWP Physiological and Artificial Consciousness Prototype\" constructed by the graduate students of the team under the guidance of Professor Duan <strong>won the Best Poster Award at the 2023 China Digital Service Conference. The prototype integrates the cognitive cycle of data-information-knowledge-wisdom and the purpose driving mechanism of physiological state, and preliminarily demonstrates the feasibility of artificial consciousness system in simulating biological cognition. These cross-disciplinary attempts show that the team has accumulated some experience not only in the field of pure AI, but also in the combination of AI + medical engineering, which lays the foundation for interdisciplinary cooperation in this project.</strong></p>\n<p>Third, the <strong>technical and experimental conditions are complete, and multidisciplinary cooperation supports</strong>. With the support of the School of Computer Science of Hainan University and cooperative medical institutions, this project will make full use of the existing experimental conditions. The team has a supporting artificial intelligence experiment platform, including high-performance computing servers and GPU clusters, which can meet the needs of deep learning model training and massive data processing. The cognitive laboratory is equipped with VR equipment, EEG/NIR imagers, wearable sensor kits, etc., which can carry out human-computer interaction experiments and physiological data collection and analysis. In addition, the team has established cooperative relationships with a number of hospitals and research institutions, such as the Department of Geriatrics of Hainan Provincial People's Hospital and the Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory of Ocean University of China, which will provide support in patient recruitment, sample testing, and image acquisition. The project team members have diverse disciplinary backgrounds, including artificial intelligence experts and software engineers, as well as neurobiologists, clinicians and rehabilitation therapists, to achieve a true cross-disciplinary team. Among them, the medical partners have the qualifications and experience to carry out clinical research, which can ensure the quality of clinical samples and trials. This project plans to apply for ethical approval and obtain informed consent from patients, and conduct research under the premise of ensuring ethics and privacy.</p>\n<p>Finally, the project team has rich experience in project management and achievement transformation. Prof. Yucong Duan has undertaken a number of national research projects and has mature experience in the organization and risk management of large-scale projects. In the past five years, the team has published dozens of high-level papers, authorized more than 100 patents, and actively promoted the transformation of production, education and research, and cooperated with science and technology enterprises to apply some patented technologies to practice. For example, the team is working with a high-tech company to build a joint laboratory for artificial awareness to explore the implementation of the DIKWP model in business intelligence software. This means that if the results of this project achieve the expected progress, there will be ample opportunities to accelerate the transformation through school-enterprise cooperation, incubation and entrepreneurship, etc., and bring practical benefits to the society.</p>\n<p>In summary, the team responsible for the project is fully prepared in terms of theory, technology, resources and cooperation. <strong>The original DIKWP theory provides strong academic support for the project, the evaluation and prototype system accumulated in the early stage prove the feasibility of the scheme, and the abundant multidisciplinary resources ensure the implementation conditions of the research. It can be expected that under the guarantee of the above favorable conditions, the project will be able to complete the scheduled research tasks with high quality and achieve the expected goals.</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"5-Milestones-and-milestones\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#5-Milestones-and-milestones\" title=\"5. Milestones and milestones\"></a><strong>5. Milestones and milestones</strong></h1><p>The proposed research cycle of this project is 5 years, and the work focus and assessment nodes are divided by year. The milestones and milestones for each year are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Year 1: Basic mechanism research and model conception stage</strong>. It focuses on experimental research on neuromolecular mechanisms and brain microenvironment, and accumulates data on disease mechanisms. At the same time, the framework of DIKWP cognitive degradation model was preliminarily established. <strong>Milestone 1</strong>: Elucidate at least 2 key biological mechanisms closely related to cognitive deterioration (e.g., the discovery that specific synaptic protein abnormalities are associated with memory decline, or the activation of an inflammatory pathway is associated with executive function decline), and form research reports or publish papers. A preliminary portrait of the DIKWP hierarchy of cognitive impairment was drawn, including a hypothetical relationship diagram of the functional changes of each layer. At the end of the first year, a workshop was held to evaluate the findings of the mechanism and to revise/enrich the cognitive model accordingly.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Year 2: Cognitive degeneration model development and validation stage</strong>. According to the data of the first year, the DIKWP model was improved, and the quantification and preliminary validation of the model were completed. <strong>Milestone 2</strong>: Construct a mathematical model of DIKWP cognitive degeneration, which can be used to simulate the changes in functional scores of each cognitive layer at different stages of the disease. Data from a cohort of follow-up patients were used to validate the explanatory power of the model (e.g., the predicted time of decline of the Wisdom layer by the model was consistent with the actual clinical stage). Write model theory papers or software work descriptions, and apply for copyright. At the end of the second year, the model was judged to be logical and reasonable and the parameters were based on expert argumentation, which could be used to guide the development of the evaluation system.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Year 3: Intelligent assessment tool development and experimentation phase</strong>. Based on the model, the hierarchical evaluation system was designed, and the software development and algorithm training of the evaluation tool were completed. <strong>Milestone 3</strong>: Developed a prototype DIKWP cognitive assessment system to achieve scale testing, multimodal data collection and risk scoring functions. Complete data collection of no less than 100 subjects, including groups such as cognitively normal, MCI, and early dementia. The early detection AI model was trained, and its performance indicators reached 0.85 for MCI recognition, &gt; sensitivity &gt; 85%, and specificity &gt; 80% (the specific indicators can be adjusted according to the experimental data). Write a technical report or apply for a patent for an evaluation tool. At the end of the third year, a mid-term evaluation meeting was held, and through comparative experiments against clinical standards, it was proved that the evaluation system was better than the traditional scale, and had the value of continuous optimization and promotion.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Year 4: Quasi-awareness intervention program development and system integration stage</strong>. Design and implement a cognitive training system for class consciousness to integrate assessment and training. <strong>Milestone 4</strong>: Completed the prototype integration of the \"quasi-consciousness assisted therapy system\", including the development and debugging of functional modules such as cognitive training games, motivation guidance modules, VR scenes, human-machine interfaces and data synchronization. The system was piloted in a laboratory setting, and feedback was collected from at least 30 patients, with zero adverse events. Optimize the user-friendliness and difficulty of the training protocol based on feedback. At the end of the fourth year, a small sample efficacy observation study was initiated to compare the changes in cognitive scores before and after 6 months of training. Expected results: The training group significantly improved or slowed down the decline in executive function or life ability assessment compared with the control group. Organize the details of the intervention plan and apply for relevant invention patents (such as \"cognitive training method based on artificial consciousness\").</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Year 5: System Improvement and Clinical Demonstration Stage</strong>. In the final year, the evaluation and training system is integrated and refined to validate and prepare for application on a larger scale. <strong>Milestone 5</strong>: Completion of clinical pilot validation – no less than 2 partner hospitals/rehabilitation centers were selected, a total of 50-100 target patients were recruited, the system was used in the actual clinical setting for evaluation and partial intervention, and follow-up results were collected. Statistical analysis showed that the evaluation indicators of this system were significantly correlated with clinical outcomes, and the functional maintenance of the intervention group was better than that of the historical control. Draft clinical guidelines were formed, including the application process of DIKWP cognitive assessment and intervention. At the same time, he completed the project summary and published no less than 2 papers in top academic journals, covering new discoveries of mechanisms, evaluation of system accuracy and intervention effects. Finally, submit the general project report, including product prototypes, data sets and models, patent software lists, etc. At the end of the fifth year, the project results passed the expert acceptance, and it is recommended to enter the next step of large-scale promotion and application.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above phases ensure that the project progresses step by step, with clear goals and measurable results every year. From the perspective of scientific output, it is expected to publish more than 5 SCI papers (including 2 papers with high impact factor), apply for 3-5 national invention patents, and cultivate several interdisciplinary talents. From the perspective of application transformation, at the end of the project, a complete prototype of the \"DIKWP Assessment and Rehabilitation System for Cognitive Impairment\" will be delivered, laying the foundation for subsequent productization. Through these milestones, the project will solidly deliver on its research objectives.</p>\n<h1 id=\"6-Assessment-indicators-and-results-form\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#6-Assessment-indicators-and-results-form\" title=\"6. Assessment indicators and results form\"></a><strong>6. Assessment indicators and results form</strong></h1><p>According to the requirements of the guidelines and the characteristics of the project itself, we have formulated the following main assessment indicators and results to evaluate the implementation effect of the project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Mechanistic research indicators: elucidate at least 2 or more innovative disease mechanisms or intervention targets, including evidence of their molecular</strong>/cellular mechanisms. Specifically, it can be manifested as the publication of more than 2 high-level papers (impact factor&gt;5). These mechanistic findings need to be recognized by peer review and their association with cognitive function described in detail in the project report. The effectiveness of the target can be assessed for reference: whether the intervention of the target can improve cognitive function or alleviate pathology in animal models.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>**Biomarker metrics: Identify several sensitive and specific markers for early diagnosis that can be used to distinguish healthy aging from MCI/**early dementia. The requested marker had an AUC &gt; 0.85 in the project dataset, and the sensitivity and specificity were both &gt;80%. These markers can be molecules (proteins, metabolites) in body fluids, neuroimaging parameters, or numerical behavioral features. The results are in the form of corresponding patents or papers, as well as technical specifications of the testing method.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>DIKWP Cognitive Scoring System: Establish a set of cognitive function assessment scales or scoring systems at the DIKWP level. The reliability and validity of the scale were good: the Cronbach α coefficient of reliability was &gt;0.8, and the correlation coefficient of the criterion correlation with the standard scale was &gt;0.7. The system is tested with no less than 100 samples, and the range of norm and critical values is given. The results are in the form of a scale manual (including instructions for use and explanation guides) and copyright registration. This scoring system will be one of the landmark achievements of the project.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Performance of intelligent evaluation tools: The AI evaluation tools developed need to reach the practical level. Quantitative indicators include: the detection accuracy of mild cognitive impairment is ≥85%, which is at least 15% higher than that of traditional methods (such as MoCA); The accuracy of discerning functional impairment at different cognitive levels was &gt; 90% by professional evaluation. Tools should also be interpretable</strong>, providing hierarchical reporting and descriptions of key indicators. The results are in the form of software prototypes, user guides, and registrations (e.g., filed as Class II medical device software).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Detection rate of abnormal Wisdom function: Our approach should significantly improve the detection rate of abnormalities in higher-order Wisdom function compared to existing clinical assessments. For example, in patients with early frontotemporal dementia with impaired executive function but normal memory, who may have been missed in the past, our system should be able to identify &gt;80%</strong> of such cases. Through clinical trial statistics, the consistency and difference between conventional diagnosis and diagnosis of this system were compared, which proved that this system has advantages in identifying very early or atypical cases. This is used as a measure of the effectiveness of the system.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Intervention Effect of Artificial Consciousness Assistance System: The effect of quasi-consciousness rehabilitation system was verified in a small clinical trial. The assessment indicators included: the average annual decline rate of cognitive scores in the intervention group decreased by more than 20% compared with the control group</strong>, and the ADL score of specific functions (such as ADL scores of activities of daily living) was maintained or improved from baseline, while the control group decreased significantly. At the same time, there was a trend of improvement in the scores of patients' behavioral symptoms, such as apathy scale and depression scale. Although the sample size is limited, it should at least show a positive direction of effect. If possible, further statistical tests showed that the difference was significant (P&lt;0.05). In addition, patient compliance and safety measures should be assessed to ensure no serious adverse events and &gt; 60% of the average daily training participation time. The results were in the form of intervention program sets and clinical observation reports.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Papers and patent achievements: During the implementation of the project, it is expected to publish more than 5 academic papers</strong> (SCI, artificial intelligence, brain science and other fields), of which at least 1-2 representative achievements will be submitted to top journals or conferences (such as Nature, Neurology, AAAI, etc.). Apply for 3-5 national invention patents, including core innovation points such as evaluation algorithms and training systems, and strive to achieve authorization. The above outputs will be used as indicators to test the innovation and academic value of the project.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Database and platform construction: Establish a DIKWP multimodal database for cognitive impairment</strong>, collect and sort out the multimodal data (including clinical scales, sensor data, images, biomarkers, etc.) and corresponding labels generated by this project. The amount of data is not less than 200 subjects, and standardized storage and sharing interfaces are realized. The database will provide a valuable resource for subsequent research and algorithm development. If possible, some datasets can be opened to the public to increase their impact. At the same time, a prototype of a cloud-based platform was developed to modularize the evaluation and training capabilities for later deployment and expansion.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, the assessment indicators cover the scientific indicators such as disease mechanism and marker sensitivity required by the guidelines, and also extend to the cognitive scoring system, intelligent diagnosis and intervention effect characteristic of this project. The form of results includes not only academic outputs such as papers and patents, but also emphasizing the actual systems and data products that can be used. We will strictly monitor the progress of the project according to the above indicators to ensure that the final results are of high quality and meet the standards, and truly achieve a comprehensive breakthrough from mechanism to application.</p>\n<h1 id=\"7-Application-and-promotion-paths\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#7-Application-and-promotion-paths\" title=\"7. Application and promotion paths\"></a><strong>7. Application and promotion paths</strong></h1><p>The expected results of this project have important clinical application prospects and industrial transformation value, and we will actively plan the application and promotion path, accelerate the results from the laboratory to the clinic and the market, and benefit the majority of patients.</p>\n<p>First of all, in terms of clinical translation, we will rely on cooperative hospitals and medical centers to carry out clinical demonstration and application of project results. In the later stage of the project, it is planned to cooperate with representative medical institutions inside and outside the province (such as geriatric departments and memory clinics of large tertiary hospitals) to establish a DIKWP assessment and rehabilitation demonstration center for cognitive impairment. Deploy our assessment systems and rehabilitation equipment in demonstration centers, used by professional doctors and therapists, to detect and train cognitively impaired patients who come to the clinic or rehabilitate. This will test the performance of our system in a real-world medical environment on the one hand, and increase clinical awareness through a demonstration effect on the other. We will develop clinical manuals and training courses to train healthcare professionals to ensure they master the operation of the system and the interpretation of data. The effects of the demonstration application (e.g., improving the early diagnosis rate, prolonging the maintenance time of patient function, etc.) will be counted through case follow-up. If the verification results are excellent, we will recommend the DIKWP assessment system to the national health authorities and academic organizations to include the DIKWP assessment system in the diagnosis and treatment guidelines or expert consensus for cognitive impairment, and promote it to become a standardized assessment tool.</p>\n<p>Secondly, in terms of productization and industrial promotion, we plan to package the project technology into a digital medical product. Specifically, it includes: \"Cognitive Impairment Hierarchical Assessment System\" software and \"Quasi-Consciousness Cognitive Training Platform\" hardware. We will improve the security and stability testing of the software in accordance with the requirements of medical device regulations, and strive to apply for medical device registration after the completion of the project, so that it can obtain legal sales qualifications. At the same time, contact powerful medical AI companies or rehabilitation equipment manufacturers to discuss cooperation and transformation models. A possible model is to invest in the technology to co-build a start-up, or to license the patent to a large company for production and promotion. For example, the evaluation software can interface with the existing electronic medical record system or health management app in China, and embed it into the existing medical IT platform to achieve large-scale deployment. The rehabilitation training platform can cooperate with professional elderly care and rehabilitation equipment manufacturers, who will produce integrated equipment with VR and biofeedback functions according to our design, and roll it out in nursing homes, community rehabilitation stations, etc.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, we attach great importance to <strong>the connection with the Wisdom pension and public health platform. China is facing the challenge of aging, and the state has issued policies such as the Action Plan for the Prevention and Treatment of Alzheimer's. Our results are aligned with this national need and can be used as</strong> an important part of Wisdom's retirement efforts. In the roll-out phase, we will work with aged care service providers, community health centers, etc., to roll out the assessment and training system to communities and families. For example, a geriatric cognitive screening program in collaboration with community health services, using our assessment tools to regularly check the cognitive function of the elderly, will help to detect problems early and refer them for timely intervention. Deploy training systems in nursing homes or day care centres to provide daily cognitive activities for seniors with mild cognitive impairment. In addition, we can build a remote assessment and rehabilitation platform and develop a mobile application, so that some elderly people who are unable to go out can also use a simplified version of assessment and training at home (of course, there are professionals to guide them remotely). Combined with the Internet of Things technology, the data can be uploaded to the cloud for real-time monitoring by doctors. This model can reduce the cost of promotion and expand the reach.</p>\n<p>In terms of publicity and education, we will raise the awareness and acceptance of DIKWP cognitive diagnosis and treatment through various channels. This includes sharing project results at academic conferences and continuing classes, and conducting training lectures for clinicians; For the general public and patients' families, the advantages of this new assessment and rehabilitation method are introduced through popular science articles, media reports, etc. Raise the public's awareness of early screening and active cognitive training, and create a good social environment for promotion and application.</p>\n<p>Finally, considering the sustainable development of the results, we plan to continue to promote the construction of an interdisciplinary collaboration platform after the end of the project. Strive to apply for the establishment of the \"Cognitive Impairment Artificial Consciousness Research Center\" or provincial and ministerial key laboratories, based on the results of this project, gather experts in related fields, further improve the technology and develop new applications. For example, the DIKWP assessment system will be extended to the cognitive assessment of other brain diseases (Parkinson's, depression, etc.), or the combination of quasi-consciousness rehabilitation and robotic care will be developed to develop intelligent companion robots. These follow-up studies and applications will become more feasible through the successful demonstration of the results of the project.</p>\n<p>In short, the promotion path of the results of this project is clear, and the influence will be <strong>amplified step by step through the steps of clinical demonstration, productization cooperation, and community integration. It is expected that within 3-5 years after the completion of the project, our DIKWP assessment tool is expected to be applied in many memory clinics in China, and the quasi-consciousness rehabilitation system will become a characteristic project of some elderly care institutions, gradually forming a new format of \"artificial consciousness + cognitive health\". In the longer term, if the promotion is successful, it will significantly improve the early diagnosis rate of cognitive impairment diseases and the quality of life of patients in China, reduce the burden of care, and at the same time give birth to a new industrial growth point of artificial intelligence in the field of medical rehabilitation, with significant social and economic benefits.</strong></p>\n<p>The above application and promotion plan ensures that the project results can be truly transformed from theoretical research to practical technology, serve the huge group of patients with cognitive impairment in China, and realize the social value and innovation leading role of major national interdisciplinary research projects.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

Sleep disorders, including insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders, are highly prevalent in the population, with about 10–35% of the general population reporting long-term insomnia. Sleep deprivation or rhythm disruptions not only affect memory, attention, and metabolic function, but also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, mood disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the pathogenic mechanism of sleep disorders and develop effective intervention methods to improve public health and reduce the burden of related diseases.</p>\n<p><strong>Research status at home and abroad:</strong><br/>In the central nervous system, the <strong>suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the core center of the mammalian biological rhythm, known as the \"brain biological clock\". Located above the hypothalamic optic chiasm, the SCN is composed of about 20,000 neurons that are able to autonomously generate a rhythm for about 24 hours and coordinate whole-body rhythms through nerve and humoral signals. SCN regulates almost all circadian rhythms, including sleep-wakefulness, such as eating, endocrine, body temperature, etc. Its main output is projected to several key regions of the hypothalamus, including the preoptic region (including the sleep promotion center VLPO</strong>), the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and the thalamus and limbic system. Through these projections, SCNs can affect hypothalamic wakefulness-promoting regions (eg, orexin/amphetamine-related peptide neurons in the lateral hypothalamus) and the ascending brainstem arousal system, thereby promoting wakefulness or sleep at different phases of circadian rhythms. For example, the classical \"flip switch\" model proposes that during the subjective daytime period, SCN activates the wakefulness-promoting pathway and inhibits VLPO through the dorsomedial hypothalamus; When nocturnal SCN activity is reduced, VLPO is activated to induce sleep. <strong>SCN rhythm disturbances have been found to be closely associated with a variety of mood disorders and sleep disturbances</strong>. Decreased neural activity and output connections of SCN in older adults are thought to be an important cause of sleep-wake cycle disruption. Therefore, <strong>maintaining normal rhythmic signals is essential for sleep homeostasis</strong>. The study of SCN and its connection to central sleep function is the key to unraveling the mechanisms of rhythm-related sleep disorders.</p>\n<p>In recent years, breakthroughs have been made in the analysis of sleep neural circuits, thanks to the development of optogenetics, <strong>chemogenetics</strong>, in <strong>vivo calcium imaging and other technologies. Optogenetics uses specific wavelengths of light to precisely control the excitation or inhibition of specific types of neurons, enabling researchers to modulate cellular activity in sleep circuits on the millisecond scale, thereby verifying the causal effect of a certain neuronal population on the sleep</strong>/wake transition. In the past decade, a large number of studies have dissected <strong>the neural circuits of sleep-wake regulation through optogenetic means</strong>, such as activating glutamatergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus to induce wakefulness, and activating GABAergic neurons in VLPO to trigger sleep. Chemogenetics (e.g., DREADDs) can regulate neuronal activity for a long time through drug administration, which is convenient for studying circuit function changes in sleep deprivation, chronic insomnia, etc. Calcium imaging techniques such as in vivo two-photon imaging and fiber optic recording allow us to observe the dynamic activity patterns of sleep-related neuronal populations in the brains of free-moving animals in real time, and the correspondence with EEG and behavioral states, thereby revealing the cooperative activity characteristics of neural networks during sleep.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>multiomics techniques are being widely used in sleep studies to find mechanisms and markers at the molecular level. Transcriptome sequencing, proteomic and metabolomic analyses showed that sleep deprivation led to extensive gene expression changes in the brain</strong>, and the differential regulation of different brain regions suggested that the molecular mechanism of sleep/wakefulness was region-specific. For example, some studies have used spatial transcriptome to find that transient sleep deprivation can cause significant changes in the expression of thousands of genes in multiple brain regions such as hippocampus, cortex, and hypothalamus, and the differential genes and regulatory directions in each region are different. In addition, proteomic and phosphoromic studies have revealed that sleep loss can trigger different protein pathway changes in astrocytes and neurons, involving processes such as synaptic plasticity, energy metabolism, and stress response. These multimodal omics data provide rich clues to our search for key molecules in sleep disorders. For example, abnormal day-and-night fluctuations in certain inflammatory factors and stress hormones in the hypothalamus and cerebrospinal fluid may be diagnostic markers for sleep rhythm disorders. For another example, the discovery of the orexin pathway has elucidated the mechanism of narcolepsy and directly led to the emergence of new drugs targeting this pathway, which is a model for the successful transformation of molecular mechanism research in the field of sleep.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that the recent research on the <strong>glymphatic system has provided a new perspective for understanding the restorative function of sleep. The glucolymphatic system is a waste product removal pathway in the brain that relies on glial cells</strong> to remove harmful metabolites through the convective exchange of cerebrospinal fluid between brain parenchyma during sleep. Studies have shown that <strong>more than 85% of metabolic waste removal occurs during sleep</strong>. During deep sleep, neuronal activity decreases and the extracellular space expands, which facilitates the removal of metabolites such as β-amyloid from cerebrospinal fluid lavage. If there is a lack of sleep or rhythm disorders, glucolymphatic function is impaired, which can lead to toxic protein deposition and accelerate the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the mechanism of action of sleep in metabolite clearance and brain health maintenance has become a hot topic. The identification of <strong>key molecules (such as AQP4 aquaporin, norepinephrine, etc.) that regulate sleep-clearance function through omics methods is of great significance for the development of new strategies for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The basis of the team's preliminary work:</strong><br/>Professor Yucong Duan, the applicant of this project, has deep research accumulation in the field of artificial intelligence and cognitive computing, and proposed the \"DIKWP Artificial Consciousness Theory\" <strong>to construct</strong> Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom-Purpose (DIKWP**). cognitive architecture. This theory expands the limitations of traditional artificial intelligence focusing on DIK (data, information, knowledge), and introduces higher-level Wisdom (W) and Purpose (P) processing units to form an artificial consciousness model. Professor Duan further proposed the network DIKWP ×DIKWP interaction model**, which is used to describe the interaction mechanism of multi-agent and multi-level intelligent systems, that is, the information exchange between different DIKWP units (agents) at all levels from data to the destination to form a dynamic network to achieve more complex cognitive and decision-making functions. This model can be compared to the network interaction between different functional regions of the brain, and has unique advantages in simulating sleep-wake brain circuit communication. Based on the DIKWP model, the team developed a prototype of the Artificial Consciousness Operating System (<strong>AC Operating System), which integrates the DIKWP system into the computing framework to realize the orchestration and management of cognitive processes. In conjunction with this OS, the team also explored semantic programming methods</strong> to directly manipulate AI systems in the form of natural language and knowledge graphs to perform complex analysis and decision-making tasks in accordance with human semantic purposes. This method is expected to be used for the integrated analysis of multi-source heterogeneous biomedical data, accelerating the transformation from data to knowledge/wisdom.</p>\n<p>Although Professor Yucong Duan's original work is mainly focused on the field of artificial intelligence, his ideas have potential cross-border innovation value for the study of sleep rhythm regulation. In recent years, the applicant team has made positive progress in applying the DIKWP theory to biomedical informatics, such as using semantic network models to assist in the analysis of multi-omics data. In addition, the team has also accumulated experience in brain network modeling and biological signal processing, which provides technical support for the implementation of this project. Based on the previous work, we have the unique advantage of combining artificial consciousness models with neuroscience experiments, and can introduce advanced algorithms of artificial intelligence into the study of sleep disorder mechanisms in this project, and open up new research perspectives and technical means.</p>\n<p>In summary, the research foundation of this project is sufficient: there is a solid theoretical and technical accumulation in the field of sleep and rhythm, and our team's original work in artificial intelligence and multimodal data fusion will inject new ideas into this project. Based on the above foundation, we are confident that we will make breakthroughs in the mechanism and intervention research of rhythm-disrupted sleep disorders, and provide innovative solutions to solve major scientific problems and clinical needs.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Research-Objectives\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-Objectives\" title=\"Research Objectives:\"></a><strong>Research Objectives:</strong></h1><p>Focusing on the theme of \"Pathogenesis and Intervention and Treatment of Sleep Disorders\", the project aims to develop the following overall objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of neural circuits in rhythmic disordered sleep disorders: construct animal models of biological rhythm disorders and sleep disorders, analyze the functional connectivity changes between the rhythmic center with the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) as the core and sleep/wakefulness-related brain regions (such as VLPO, lateral hypothalamus, etc.), and reveal the circuit-level mechanism of rhythm disorders-induced sleep disorders.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Revealing the key molecular mechanisms of sleep regulation and metabolic waste removal: Transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and other multi-omics technologies were used to systematically identify the key molecules of sleep-wake regulation and brain metabolite clearance during sleep.

When biorhythms are disrupted (e.g., circadian cycle disorders or clock gene dysfunction), how do the activity patterns and functional connections of these key circuits change, leading to abnormalities in sleep structure and behavior?

Does the dysrhythmia impair this clearance process? What are the molecular and cellular components that play a key role in sleep-clearance function (e.g., AQP4 water channels, norepinephrine, astrocytes, etc.), and how do their functional changes explain the cognitive decline and increased risk of neurodegeneration that are common in patients with sleep disorders? Is it possible to capture biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid or blood that reflect the disorder of this process</strong>?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Mechanism of non-invasive brain stimulation on sleep rhythm: what are the effects and neurobiological mechanisms of non-invasive brain regulation technologies such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial electrical stimulation (tDCS/TES), transcranial ultrasound, and ambient light regulation on improving sleep and correcting rhythm disorders? How do different stimulation patterns (frequency, intensity, timing) affect neural activity and network dynamics in sleep-related brain regions, thereby altering sleep states (e.g., prolonging the duration of deep sleep, improving sleep efficiency, etc.)?

Is it possible to integrate multi-source data (EEG, neural activity, omics, physiological signals, etc.) through the artificial consciousness operating system to realize intelligent monitoring and abnormal detection of sleep status? How does semantic programming play a role in mining the underlying mechanisms of sleep disorders and screening therapeutic targets? Finally, can an AI-assisted closed-loop feedback system be built to automatically adjust stimulation parameters according to real-time monitoring of sleep physiological indicators to achieve optimal regulation of sleep?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The above scientific questions are interrelated and cover the entire chain from the basic mechanism to the application transformation. Addressing these issues will enrich our systematic understanding of the occurrence and progression of sleep disorders and provide a scientific basis for the development of new therapies.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Research-content-and-methodology\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-content-and-methodology\" title=\"Research content and methodology\"></a><strong>Research content and methodology</strong></h1><p>In order to answer the above scientific questions, the project has set up four major research contents, each part of which includes a number of specific research tasks and technical routes. Each part is connected to each other, layer by layer, and integrated into DIKWP artificial consciousness theory and related methods, so as to achieve the innovative integration of theory and technology.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-Construction-of-model-of-rhythm-disorder-and-sleep-disorder-and-research-on-brain-function-connection\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#1-Construction-of-model-of-rhythm-disorder-and-sleep-disorder-and-research-on-brain-function-connection\" title=\"1. Construction of model of rhythm disorder and sleep disorder and research on brain function connection\"></a><strong>1. Construction of model of rhythm disorder and sleep disorder and research on brain function connection</strong></h2><p><strong>Main contents: To construct animal models of various rhythmic sleep disorders, to characterize their pathological characteristics from the macroscopic behavior to the microscopic neural circuit level, and to analyze the change map of brain functional connectivity with SCN as the core. This paper focuses on</strong> the changes in the strength and pattern of functional connectivity between SCN and sleep/wake regulation (VLPO, lateral hypothalamus LH, thalamus and brainstem reticular ascending system) under the condition of rhythm disorder.</p>\n<p><strong>Methods:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Model establishment: A variety of methods were used to induce rhythm disorders and sleep disorders in mice. For example,</strong> disrupting the peripheral clock with ambient light interventions (inverting the circadian cycle, prolonging light, etc.); genetic knockout/mutation of core clock genes (e.g., Bmal1 or Clock); or apply jet lag simulation (changing the eating/activity cycle). Animal activity-resting rhythms and changes in sleep structure (EEG/EMG) were recorded to screen out models that stably reproduce the characteristics of human sleep disorders. Phenotypes of the model included decreased sleep duration, increased fragmentation, decreased circadian amplitude or phase dislocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Brain network measurements: Multi-channel in vivo electrophysiological recordings combined with local field potentials of brain slices were used to</strong> measure the synchronization and information transfer between SCNs and downstream sleep-related nuclei in model animals and normal controls. Neural tracing techniques (anterograde and retrograde tracers) were used to map the anatomical connections of SCN to each node of the sleep circuit, and combined with c-Fos functional markers and fMRI functional imaging, to determine the degree of influence of rhythm disorders on the functional connections of these pathways. It is expected that a map of brain functional connectivity will reveal changes in the activity of key pathways (e.g., whether neural activity in the SCN-preoptic pathway is attenuated in the model, and whether VLPO is impaired in inhibitory function of the brainstem arousal center).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Optogenetic and Fiber Optic Imaging Analysis: Select nodes with significantly altered functions in the above circuits, and use optogenetics to precisely regulate their activities to verify their causal role in sleep disorders. For example, in the arrhythmic disorder model, selective light stimulates the SCN output pathway to simulate normal rhythmic signals to see if it can correct the sleep disorder phenotype; or inhibiting overactive arousal to promote neuronal populations to see if it can improve sleep quality. At the same time, optical fiber recording/in vivo calcium imaging was used to monitor the dynamic activity of these neuronal populations at</strong> different stages of the sleep/wake cycle, so as to gain a deeper understanding of how rhythm signals regulate sleep occurrence. The data recorded by the fiber will be collected and analyzed in real time through the artificial consciousness OS: the \"data-information\" layer of the DIKWP model is used to filter and extract neural activity features, the \"knowledge-wisdom\" layer is used for pattern recognition and correlation analysis with sleep state, and the \"purpose\" layer is used to guide the next intervention (such as deciding when to give light stimulation to improve sleep).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>DIKWP network simulation: Based on the above experimental evidence, a mesh DIKWP × DIKWP interaction model was constructed to simulate the brain</strong> rhythm-sleep network. The SCN and the main target brain regions are regarded as agent nodes with DIKWP hierarchical processing architecture: the SCN nodes periodically generate rhythm signals (data layer); Downstream nodes receive and transform information, accumulate it into knowledge, and generate wisdom decisions on sleep/wakefulness (e.g., VLPO inhibits wakefulness center to induce sleep); Each node also has a goal to achieve a specific physiological purpose (homeostasis). The artificial consciousness operating system is used to orchestrate the interaction of these nodes to simulate the network dynamics under normal and disordered conditions. By comparing with the experimental observations, the model parameters were continuously adjusted to reconstruct the overall loop of <strong>sleep-rhythm regulation in the computer</strong>. This simulation can help predict the role of certain untested connections in the disorder, and provide hypothetical guidance for the next stage of experimentation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Expected results: To obtain a visual map of the functional connectivity of sleep circuits under the condition of rhythm disorder, and identify 2~3 neural pathways (such as SCN-VLPO or SCN-LH pathway) that are critical for sleep disorders. The function of these pathways is verified by causal interventions. The loop simulation based on the DIKWP model will deepen the understanding of the systematic characteristics of the sleep loop and provide computational support for subsequent research.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-Multiomics-analysis-of-the-molecular-mechanism-of-sleep-regulation-and-metabolic-clearance\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-Multiomics-analysis-of-the-molecular-mechanism-of-sleep-regulation-and-metabolic-clearance\" title=\"2. Multiomics analysis of the molecular mechanism of sleep regulation and metabolic clearance\"></a><strong>2. Multiomics analysis of the molecular mechanism of sleep regulation and metabolic clearance</strong></h2><p><strong>Main contents: In rhythm disorders and control animals, multi-level omics analysis of brain regions and body fluids related to sleep and metabolite clearance was performed to search for key molecules, pathways and biomarkers</strong>. Combining semantic programming and bioinformatics tools to transform multi-omics data into a systematic understanding of mechanisms.</p>\n<p><strong>Methods:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Targeted tissue and temporal sampling: According to the results of study content 1, several key brain regions of sleep regulation (such as SCN, VLPO, lateral hypothalamus, hippocampus, etc.) and cerebrospinal fluid samples were selected. Tissue and body fluid samples were obtained from animals in different phases (subjective daytime, night, sleep and wake states) under normal circadian cycle and rhythm disturbances to capture dynamic change information. Particular attention is paid to differences between sleep and wakefulness, as well as abnormal patterns resulting from rhythm disturbances.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Transcriptome and epimics: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to analyze the gene expression profile changes of the above brain regions under different conditions. It focuses on</strong> the differential expression of biorhythm genes (such as downstream genes regulated by Clock/Bmal1), <strong>sleep-related genes</strong> (such as encoding neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, etc.), and metabolic and inflammatory pathway genes. Combined with epigeneomics (e.g., DNA methylation sequencing, histone modification ChIP-seq), this paper explores whether rhythm disorders affect the rhythmicity of gene expression through epiregulatory mechanisms. It is expected that dozens of candidate genes that are significantly dysregulated in sleep disorder models can be identified, providing clues for further research.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Proteomics and metabolomics: High-resolution mass spectrometry is used to analyze changes in protein expression and modification in corresponding brain regions, as well as metabolite profiles in cerebrospinal fluid. Particular attention is paid to</strong> changes in the levels of proteins (e.g., AQP4, aquaporins, synaptic plasticity-related receptors, inflammatory factors, etc.) and metabolic wastes (e.g., lactate, β-amyloid fragments, etc.) associated with sleep-clearance function. Improve quantitation accuracy with labeled quantification (TMT or iTRAQ) and compare models to controls. Combined with metabolomic data, the disorders of energy metabolism, neurotransmitter metabolism and metabolic waste clearance pathways during sleep were revealed.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Key molecule identification: Based on the results of multi-omics, 23 key regulatory molecules with repeated abnormalities in the sleep disorder model were screened. For example, it may be found that an inflammatory mediator and a hormone pathway molecule are consistently upregulated, suggesting that it may mediate a decrease in sleep quality. For these molecules, literature research and database analysis can be used to understand their function, and follow-up validation experiments (such as gene knockout or drug antagonism) can be designed to evaluate their causal effects. In addition, 12 potential diagnostic markers were screened from cerebrospinal fluid metabolites, which were required to show significant and detectable changes in the rhythm disorder model, which are expected to be detected clinically by non-invasive means for the diagnosis or risk prediction of sleep disorders in the future.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Multimodal data integration and semantic analysis: In the face of massive omics data, we will introduce artificial intelligence to assist in integrated analysis. Using the semantic programming method developed by the applicant team</strong>, the knowledge graph related to sleep regulation was constructed, and the molecules and pathways found in the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome were represented by semantic networks and associated with existing biological knowledge (such as Gene Ontology and KEGG pathways). Through the artificial consciousness OS, the data is processed in layers under the DIKWP framework: the data layer is standardized, the information layer is used for statistical analysis and pattern extraction (such as co-expression network and molecular module identification), the knowledge layer introduces literature evidence and biological pathway knowledge to explain these patterns, the Wisdom layer finds out the most likely regulatory core molecules through reasoning, and the purpose layer finally forms answers to research questions (such as determining the most critical pathological circuits and molecules). The whole process is controlled by semantic instructions, and the researchers ask the system in a way that is close to natural language (e.g., \"find out the upstream regulators that cause sleep quality decline\"), and the system synthesizes multiple sources of information through artificial consciousness models to provide answers or hypotheses. This will greatly improve the efficiency of the transformation of multi-omics data into biological knowledge.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Validation experiments: Targeted validation of key molecules and markers identified. For example, immunohistochemistry was used to verify the expression changes of key proteins in model brain tissues; Brain stereotactic injection of specific receptor agonists</strong>/antagonists to target brain regions was used to observe the effect on sleep behavior; For markers, ELISA assays were designed to assess their level differences in more model individuals or pre-experimental clinical subjects to confirm their diagnostic value.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expected results: 2~3 regulatory molecules and pathways that play a key role in arrhythmic sleep disorders were identified, and their mechanisms affecting sleep and metabolic clearance were clarified. These molecules will be potential targets for intervention. At the same time, 1~2 kinds of humoral markers that can be used for early diagnosis of diseases or efficacy monitoring were screened. Construct a molecular network model of sleep regulation with multi-layer information to deepen the systematic understanding of the molecular regulation mechanism of sleep. The efficient integration of multi-omics data with the help of the semantic analysis of the artificial consciousness framework is also an innovative methodological achievement in itself.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"3-Research-on-the-mechanism-and-mode-of-action-of-non-invasive-brain-regulation\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-Research-on-the-mechanism-and-mode-of-action-of-non-invasive-brain-regulation\" title=\"3.

Research on the mechanism and mode of action of non-invasive brain regulation</strong></h2><p><strong>Main contents: To study the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation and regulation methods on sleep and biorhythms, analyze their neural circuits and molecular mechanisms, optimize stimulation patterns, and explore personalized regulatory strategies. The purpose of this study is to provide a theoretical basis for the development of new intervention methods and lay a foundation for the next step of device development.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Methods:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Screening of intervention methods: Several non-invasive brain modulation methods with current application prospects were selected, including transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS</strong>), <strong>transcranial electrical stimulation (tDCS/TES),</strong> <strong>transcranial low-intensity ultrasound stimulation</strong>, and <strong>audio-visual stimulation</strong>(e.g., sound pulses of specific frequencies, light pulses induce brain waves), etc. The effects of these measures on sleep markers were preliminarily tested in animal models of rhythm disorders. For example, model mice were subjected to rTMS with specific parameters during their active period, and the changes in EEG slow-wave activity, total sleep time, and number of awakenings during sleep were observed. or use slow-wave synchronized sound stimulation to enhance their deep sleep ratio during sleep. By comparing different methods and parameter combinations, 1~2 intervention methods with significant effects on improving the sleep of the model were screened.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Mechanism of action research: In-depth analysis of the mechanism of action for the best methods screened. In animal experiments, a combination of electrophysiology and imaging techniques was used to investigate the immediate and long-term effects of stimuli on activity in relevant areas of the brain. For example, microelectrodes can be used to record changes in cortical and thalamic neurons when rTMS is applied, or functional imaging can be used to observe how thalamic reticular nucleus activity changes after low-intensity focused ultrasound stimulation, so as to infer the mechanism of its sleep-promoting neural circuitry. In the case of transcranial electrical stimulation</strong>, the modulation effect on the slow-wave oscillation of the cortex and its propagation effect to the downstream sleep center were recorded. The effects of these stimuli on neurotransmitter levels (e.g., promoting melatonin secretion or decreasing stress-related transmitters) will also be examined to assess their effects at the molecular level.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Parameter optimization and mode exploration: Based on the understanding of the mechanism, the stimulation parameters are systematically optimized, such as adjusting the frequency and pulse sequence of rTMS to maximize the proportion of slow-wave sleep; Optimize tDCS electrode placement and current intensity to safely and effectively induce drowsiness. At the same time, rhythm-dependent stimulation patterns are explored: for example, in accordance with the circadian rhythm, sleep stimuli are given during the physiological sleep period, and intervention is avoided during the wake period to re-establish a normal rhythm. Artificial intelligence algorithms</strong> (reinforcement learning, etc.) are used to establish feedback models: sensors monitor the EEG and behavioral states of animals (or human volunteers) in real time, and AI decides when and in what mode to apply stimuli to achieve closed-loop adaptive regulation. The algorithm will be deployed on an artificial consciousness operating system, which continuously adjusts the stimulation program according to a set \"purpose\" (e.g., improving sleep quality) to simulate the autonomous optimization ability of artificial consciousness in the regulation process.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Individualized Difference Analysis: Taking into account differences in the response of biological individuals to stimuli, this section will evaluate the feasibility of individualized regulation. For example, the intervention experiment was repeated on different animal individuals, and data on their underlying sleep lineage and response to stimuli were collected, and the classification of response patterns (e.g., \"strongly responsive\", \"weakly responsive\") was found through machine learning clustering. Combine multiomics or genetic analysis to explore the biological basis of individual differences (e.g., differences in stimulation effects due to polymorphisms in certain genes). This will help to implement individualized sleep intervention programs in the population in the future.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expected results: To elucidate the mode and mechanism of action of non-invasive brain stimulation in improving sleep</strong>, for example, to demonstrate that rTMS can improve sleep quality by enhancing cortical-thalamic slow-wave network activity to prolong the duration of deep sleep. The combination of key parameters (such as optimal stimulation frequency, current intensity, etc.) and its neurobiological effects were identified to provide a basis for the subsequent formulation of clinical stimulation programs. A prototype of closed-loop brain-computer regulation principle was formed: a real-time monitoring and feedback stimulation system for sleep state based on artificial intelligence, and its effectiveness in animal models was verified.

For example, the development of wearable headbands or cap devices that integrate multi-channel EEG acquisition and controllable stimulation modules (electrical or acoustic stimulation, etc.). The device is powered by a microprocessor or mobile terminal that runs an artificial consciousness OS</strong> that analyzes the user's sleep stages in real time and automatically triggers appropriate interventions (e.g., applying a mild stimulus to guide a return to deep sleep when a tendency to light sleep or arousal is detected) based on a built-in optimization algorithm (a closed-loop model from Study Content 3). The whole device emphasizes non-invasive, portable, and adaptive, and provides a human-machine interface for users to monitor sleep quality. The device will be tested under laboratory conditions, including algorithm accuracy (sleep staging discrimination is consistent with conventional polysomnography), reliability of stimulation output, and safety (e.g., current intensity is within a safe range with no significant side effects).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Key technical research: In order to realize the above device functions, it is necessary to solve several technical problems, such as: long-term EEG acquisition with low noise and high comfort, miniaturized controllable stimulation circuit design, artificial consciousness OS transplantation and optimization in embedded platforms, and the application of semantic programming in human-computer interaction interface (enabling professional physicians to customize the intervention strategy of the device through high-level semantic instructions). In response to these, the project members will work together to tackle key problems, and use existing patents and experience. It is expected to form independent intellectual property rights in device hardware design, circuit safety, signal processing algorithms, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Design of new treatment methods: In addition to physical devices, this project also plans to propose 1~2 innovative treatment ideas based on the discovery of new targets/molecules</strong>. For example, if omics studies have found that inflammatory pathways play a prominent role in rhythm disorders, an evaluation of the effect of anti-inflammatory drugs in animal models may be tried; Or for comorbidities such as depression associated with rhythm disorders, explore new schemes of combined psychobehavioral therapy. In addition, noninvasive stimulation can be combined with medications (e.g., low-dose melatonin during the day to adjust the phase, and brain stimulation at night to prolong deep sleep) to form a comprehensive intervention strategy. Each candidate will be validated in animal models for efficacy, such as improving sleep duration, restoring circadian rhythms, etc., and evaluating the safety window. Excellent protocols will be screened for further translational research.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>IIT Studies and Preliminary Clinical Trials: Later in the program, if a device or therapy proves to be effective and safe in animals, we will initiate investigator-initiated clinical trial (IIT) preparation. After ethics approval, recruit small-scale subjects (e.g., 10-20 volunteers with sleep disorders) to try out new devices or protocols under strict monitoring. The observed indicators included subjective sleep quality score, objective polysomnography parameters, and daytime function improvement. Trials will assess the effects of the intervention using a randomised controlled or self-controlled before-and-after design. At the same time, improve the layout of intellectual property rights (such as timely application for invention patents and software copyrights) to clear the obstacles for subsequent large-scale clinical application and industrial transformation. Strive to complete 1~2 IIT studies with independent intellectual property rights</strong>, and push the laboratory results to the substantive stage of clinical transformation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expected results: 2~3 innovative and validated methods for the regulation of sleep disorders were developed. This may include a prototype device for intelligent closed-loop sleep regulation, as well as several optimized stimulation therapies or drug combinations. Through performance tests and preliminary trials, it has been proven to be effective and safe in improving sleep and regulating rhythms. Apply for a number of patents, publish guidelines or specification suggestions, and lay the foundation for future product registration and promotion. The results of this section will mark a critical leap from mechanistic research to applied translation.</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"Technical-route\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Technical-route\" title=\"Technical route\"></a><strong>Technical route</strong></h1><p>In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the above research contents, this project formulates a clear technical roadmap, which is promoted from basic to application, and each stage supports and verifies each other:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Model Establishment and Circuit Interpretation Phase (Year 1–2): First, an animal model of rhythmic sleep disorder is constructed to obtain behavioral and basic physiological characteristics. Subsequently, brain circuit studies were performed on the model, including neural tracing, electrophysiological recording, and optogenetic interventions, functional connectivity mapping and identification of key abnormal circuits. The artificial consciousness model was used to simulate the loop to form a preliminary hypothetical framework for the mechanism.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Multi-omics Integration and Mechanism Mining Phase (Year 2–3): Multi-omics data is collected from model and control animals, and a combination of experimental and artificial intelligence analysis is used to extract a list of molecules and pathway networks associated with sleep and metabolic clearance disorders. The multi-omics results can be used to explain the discovery of the loop level (e.g., molecular changes in a pathway support an abnormality in a circuit) and to provide new targets for intervention on the other. During this period, the data is integrated through semantic programming, and the scope of key problems is gradually narrowed.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Intervention Validation and Optimization Phase (Year 3–4): For the loops and molecular targets proposed in the first two stages, non-invasive stimulation and other means are used to verify the intervention. By continuously adjusting the stimulation method and parameters, and optimizing with the help of AI feedback, the sleep phenotype of the model was improved. The verification results will be fed back to the models and mechanisms in the previous stage to improve the understanding of pathological mechanisms. At the same time, the mechanism of action of the intervention means is studied in depth at this stage in order to optimize its effect.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Device Development and Initial Transformation Phase (Year 4–5): Design and develop intelligent control devices and new treatment options based on all previous results. After the small-scale trial is effective, the IIT research will be promoted. Improve technical details to form standard operating procedures and preclinical data. At the end of the project, we will strive to achieve a closed loop of transformation from mechanism research to application prototype.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Throughout the above phases, the <strong>AI-aware DIKWP framework will serve as a unified platform to support data analysis, model building, and feedback control.

Whether it is drug abuse (such as opioids, nicotine, alcohol, etc.) or behavioral addiction such as online games and gambling, it involves abnormalities in the brain's reward circuits, manifested as compulsive pursuit of reward stimuli and uncontrollable use. Studies have shown that all addictive substances activate the common mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway, which is the dopamine pathway that projects from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain to regions such as the nucleus accumbens through the midbrain-limbic system. This <strong>midbrain-limbic pathway</strong> (see figure below) plays a key role in the regulation of motivation, reward, and reinforcement learning, and its dysfunction is thought to be one of the core mechanisms of addiction initiation and maintenance. <em>Figure: The midbrain-limbic dopamine reward pathway shows the purpose (the blue route indicates dopamine projection from VTA to nucleus accumbens, etc</em>.).<br/><img alt=\"图片描述\" src=\"/cooperation/items/media/image4.png\" style=\"width:50%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;\"/><br/>Due to the complexity and persistence of addictive behaviors, current withdrawal treatments have limited efficacy and relapse rates remain high. Addiction is seen as a chronic, recurrent brain disorder that requires long-term management rather than a one-time cure. Even after treatment, about 40%~60% of addiction patients will relapse within half a year. Existing drug-assisted treatments (eg, methadone for opioid addiction, naltrexone for alcohol addiction, etc.) alleviate withdrawal symptoms to some extent, but there are also significant limitations and side effects. For example, methadone replacement therapy carries its own risk of addiction, naltrexone may cause hepatotoxicity and adherence problems, and the cigarette withdrawal drug varenicline can cause emotional side effects. These problems have resulted in many patients not being able to adhere to treatment, highlighting the urgency of innovative intervention strategies.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the treatment of behavioral addiction (such as game addiction and gambling addiction) lacks specific drugs, mainly relies on psychological interventions, and the effect is easily affected by individual subjective factors. The study found that there are similarities between online game addiction and substance addiction in terms of neural mechanisms, such as impaired value decision-making function and reduced sensitivity to loss aversion. Functional imaging studies have also shown that the reward processing pathways of game addicts function abnormally, and similarly exhibit overreaction to addiction cues and weakened cognitive control in drug addicts. However, the current understanding of the brain circuit mechanism of behavioral addiction is incomplete, and its causal interaction network across brain regions needs to be analyzed urgently.</p>\n<p><strong>Clinical needs</strong>: In the face of high recurrence rate and limited intervention methods, there is an urgent need to deeply analyze the occurrence and development process of addictive behaviors from the perspective of neural mechanisms, and develop new intervention strategies accordingly. These include: (1) revealing neuromolecular, cellular, and cerebral circuit abnormalities as well as cognitive and emotional dysfunction of addiction at multiple levels; (2) to evaluate the mechanism of action and limitations of existing detoxification drugs and therapies, and to find the causal chain of side effects; (3) the design of novel withdrawal interventions that are more effective and have fewer side effects; (4) Formulate digital and personalized intervention programs for the increasingly prominent problem of behavioral addiction. The National Key R&amp;D Program lists \"Neural Mechanism Analysis of Addiction and Withdrawal Intervention Strategies\" as a key guideline direction, which is based on the above urgent needs.</p>\n<p><strong>New opportunities for artificial intelligence and artificial consciousness</strong>: In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has provided new means for the study of complex brain diseases. Among them, the <strong>artificial consciousness model has attracted attention, which tries to make AI have the elements of human-like consciousness, so as to better simulate human high-level cognitive and behavioral processes. This project intends to introduce the</strong> \"Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom-Purpose\" artificial consciousness model proposed by Chinese scholar Professor Yucong Duan. The model adds the top layer of \"Purpose/Purpose\" to the traditional DIKW (pyramid) architecture, and realizes two-way feedback and iterative update of semantics at all levels through mesh interaction. This system provides a framework for formalizing and structuring human cognitive processes, enabling AI to simulate human perception, cognition, and motivational decision-making processes in an \"explainable and controllable\" manner. In particular, the DIKWP model emphasizes the \"Purpose\" drive: the AI system not only processes the linear process from data to knowledge when sensing and making decisions, but is also led by the built-in goal/purpose layer to achieve self-regulation and iterative optimization. This purpose-driven cyclic structure enables AI to have the ability to self-explanatory and self-optimized prototypes, which is seen as an important path to artificial consciousness. With the help of this model, we are expected to simulate the information processing and motivational driving mechanisms of the brain of addicted individuals at different levels, and establish concepts such as \"semantic behavioral causal chain\" and \"cognitive addiction pathway\" to understand addictive behavior from a new perspective.</p>\n<p>In short, the significance of this project is to combine the latest artificial consciousness models and semantic technologies to propose new ideas and tools for interdisciplinary integration of the major topic of addiction neural mechanisms and intervention strategies. Guided by clinical needs, the project strives to make original breakthroughs in the analysis of addiction mechanisms and withdrawal intervention methods, and provide scientific support and technical reserves for the prevention and treatment of addiction.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Research-status-and-development-trend-at-home-and-abroad\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-status-and-development-trend-at-home-and-abroad\" title=\"Research status and development trend at home and abroad\"></a><strong>Research status and development trend at home and abroad</strong></h1><h2 id=\"Advances-in-the-neurobiological-mechanisms-of-addiction\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Advances-in-the-neurobiological-mechanisms-of-addiction\" title=\"Advances in the neurobiological mechanisms of addiction\"></a><strong>Advances in the neurobiological mechanisms of addiction</strong></h2><p><strong>Circuits and molecular mechanisms of substance addiction</strong>: A large number of studies have revealed that substance addiction involves the remodeling of multiple neural circuits in the brain, especially the <strong>midbrain-limbic dopamine reward system. Addictive drugs (such as cocaine, morphine, nicotine, etc.) can enhance the release of dopamine from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain</strong> to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to varying degrees, triggering a strong reward effect and disrupting the inhibitory control of behavior in the frontal cortex. As shown in the figure, the midbrain-cortex-limbic circuit, consisting of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and ventral tegmental area (VTA), <strong>plays a key role in behaviors such as rewarding learning, impulsivity, and addiction. Long-term addiction can lead to changes in synaptic plasticity in this circuit, such as chronic drug exposure inducing a</strong> disturbance in the excitatory/inhibitory balance of the cortical-nucleus accumbens pathway, which reinforces drug-seeking behavior. In addition, the addiction process is accompanied by a series of molecular adaptations, such as the accumulation of transcription factors such as ΔFosB, the downregulation of dopamine D2 receptors, and the changes in glutamate receptor subunits, which shape the pathological dependence of the brain on drugs.</p>\n<p>In addition to the reward circuit, <strong>there has been an increase in attention in recent years to counter the reward/stress pathway. Repeated drug use not only triggers overactivation of the reward system, but the subsequent phase of withdrawal from negative emotions is associated with the stress system in the brain (e.g., activation of the CRF stress pathway in the middle amygdala). Addiction is thought to be the result of a combination of reduced reward system function and increased stress system functioning. This also explains why addicts find it difficult to quit because of the pain of withdrawal, even if they no longer get pleasure.</strong></p>\n<p>In terms of domestic research, many teams have used modern neuroscience technology to deeply analyze the addiction circuit. For example, the team of Professor Xin Wenjun of Sun Yat-sen University used optogenetics and in vivo calcium imaging to find two fine neural circuits projected to the anterior and posterior bundle nucleus (IPAC) in the conditional position preference (CPP) model of morphine addiction in rats: one from VTA GABAergic neurons, which is involved in the formation of reward effect; The other is a D1 dopamine receptor-positive neuron from the shell region of the nucleus accumbens, which is involved in the formation of environmental memory. Together, both contribute to the establishment of drug addiction. This achievement reveals the role of a new connection pathway between the midbrain, the nucleus accumbens, and the extended amygdala (IPAC) in addiction, and provides leading evidence for understanding the circuit mechanism of addiction.</p>\n<p>In addition, domestic scholars have also focused on the long-term plasticity of addiction. For example, studies have reported the dual roles of neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and prefrontal lobes in addiction formation and withdrawal. Studies from Peking University and other institutions have found that chronic morphine exposure causes microglia to release inflammatory factors, which regulate dopaminergic neuronal activity and aggravate addictive behavior. These advances suggest that the neural mechanisms of addiction are complex multi-level networks, including neural circuit reorganization, neuroimmunity, and plasticity changes, which provide key background knowledge for this project.</p>\n<p><strong>Cognitive neural mechanism of behavioral addiction</strong>: Compared with substance addiction, behavioral addiction such as gambling and gaming has no direct exogenous drug effect, and its addiction characteristics are more reflected in the abnormality of cognitive processes and decision-making mechanisms. Despite the lack of drug stimulation, behavioral addicts exhibit similar alterations in brain function as substance addicts. For example, functional MRI studies have shown that when online game addicts complete decision-making tasks, <strong>the activation of higher-order cognitive regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is reduced, and the value assessment function such as loss aversion is impaired. At the same time, reward-related nucleus accumbens and dopamine pathways overreact to game-related cues. This supports the neurological basis for behavioral addictions to share part of substance addiction.</strong></p>\n<p>Theoretically, behavioral addiction can be seen as the result of dysfunction of reinforcement learning mechanisms: an individual's preference for immediate reward (instant gratification) is too strong, and there is insufficient consideration for delayed punishment or long-term benefits. This is related to the <strong>imbalance between model-based and habit-free decision-making systems in the brain. Normally, model-driven (supported by the prefrontal-hippocampus, etc.) and model-independent habituation systems (supported by the striatum, etc.) work together. However, in the addictive state, the transition from model-driven to model-independent behavior has been observed, and addicts rely more on unconscious habitual responses than on purposeful rational decision-making. Studies have shown that this shift is associated with specific areas of the brain, such as the orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral striatum, that change their function during addiction, leading to a shift in behavior from goal-oriented to habit-driven. This finding suggests that we need to pay attention to changes in the decision-making system of addicts and incorporate them into the model.</strong></p>\n<p>In conclusion, important progress has been made in the study of the neural mechanism of addiction at home and abroad, which provides a solid foundation for this project. However, most of the existing studies focus on single-level (molecular/cellular or behavioral/cognitive) mechanisms, and lack of cross-level integrated models. Moreover, the understanding of the mechanism of behavioral addiction needs to be deepened. We need a framework that integrates multiple levels of data and takes into account both biological and cognitive factors to comprehensively unravel the mechanisms of addiction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Withdrawal-intervention-strategies-and-limitations\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Withdrawal-intervention-strategies-and-limitations\" title=\"Withdrawal intervention strategies and limitations\"></a><strong>Withdrawal intervention strategies and limitations</strong></h2><p><strong>Medication-assisted therapy</strong>: Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is a common strategy for substance addiction. For example, opioid addiction with methadone, buprenorphine replacement therapy, or naltrexone blockade therapy; alcohol addiction with naltrexone, disulfur, and acrosate; Nicotine addiction uses nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion or varenicline, among others. These drugs have been shown to be effective in reducing cravings and reducing withdrawal symptoms. However, its limitations are also obvious: (1) the replacement therapy itself may be addictive (e.g., methadone needs to be taken for a long time and there is a risk of dependence); (2) poor compliance with blockers, and patients often have difficulty in adherence; (3) Significant drug side effects, such as naltrexone can cause liver damage, varenicline may induce depression and abnormal dreams, etc.; (4) Individual differences are large, the efficacy is different, and there is a lack of accurate personalization. As a result, the long-term success rate of drug dependence alone is limited, and other interventions and the exploration of new drugs are needed.</p>\n<p>Modern pharmacological research is also looking for new targets for addiction treatment, such as CRF receptor antagonists that regulate stress responses, NMDA receptor modulators that affect memory restructuring, and pro-neuroplasticity pro-molecules. But so far, no revolutionary new drugs have been introduced. On the one hand, the neural adaptation mechanisms of addiction are complex and diverse, and single-target therapy is often difficult to achieve. On the other hand, the R&amp;D cycle of new drugs is long and risky. As a result, some studies have begun to explore drug repurposing strategies, i.e., new uses of existing drugs, such as antiepileptic drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs in reducing addiction relapse. This requires a deep understanding of existing drug mechanisms and finding entry points in their networks of action, which is part of the reason why this project is intended to be implemented using semantic modeling.</p>\n<p><strong>Behavioral and psychological interventions</strong>: Psychosocial interventions are equally important in addiction treatment, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), motivational enhancement therapy (MET), mindfulness training, and others. These methods aim to change the negative cognitive and behavioral patterns of addicts and improve their ability to cope with cravings and stress. Traditionally, these therapies have been administered face-to-face by therapists, which has the disadvantages of high cost and limited coverage. In recent years, there has been an <strong>uptick in digital cognitive interventions, such as the delivery of CBT courses and support through mobile apps and online platforms. Several randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that digital CBT programmes are effective in reducing alcohol and drug use. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also approved prescription digital therapeutics for the treatment of SUDs, such as reSET applications, indicating that digital interventions are becoming an important adjunct. However, most current digital therapeutics lack personalized and intelligent feedback</strong>: i.e., little dynamic adjustment based on the patient's real-time state (cognitive load, mood swings, brain activity, etc.). This is where AI comes into play, by analyzing user behavior and physiological data to intelligently adapt the content and intensity of interventions.</p>\n<p><strong>Brain-Computer Interface and Neuromodulation</strong>: Emerging neuromodulation technologies offer hope for refractory addiction cases. For example, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is used to modulate prefrontal cortex activity and has been shown to have some effect on reducing cravings in cocaine and alcohol addiction; Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is tested in patients with refractory drug addiction, targeting the nucleus accumbens to inhibit excessive reward drive. Brain-computer interface (BCI) combined with neurofeedback training is also a hot topic. In recent years, the University of Science and Technology of China and other units have built cognitively guided brain-computer interface neurofeedback systems for nicotine addiction intervention. By allowing the subjects to perform cognitive training under EEG monitoring and real-time feedback on their brain activity patterns, the study found that the subjects' brain responses to smoking cues were significantly reduced after training, and the accuracy of the classifier in discriminating smoking-related EEG reached about 70%. This suggests that BCI-neurofeedback has the potential to reshape the brain response patterns of addicts and reduce sensitivity to addiction cues. It is foreseeable that future interventions will be more combined with non-invasive brain-computer interfaces to achieve monitoring and real-time regulation of brain status. This project intends to combine brain-computer interface with artificial consciousness model to explore a new model of closed-loop intervention: to judge the patient's state through the semantic interpretation of brain signals, and to generate corresponding intervention instructions (such as prompts and stimuli) by artificial intelligence to form a human-computer collaborative withdrawal support system.</p>\n<p><strong>Domestic and international trends</strong>: In general, addiction intervention strategies are developing in the direction of diversified integration and precise personality. On the one hand, it emphasizes <strong>bio-psycho-social integrated interventions</strong>, and on the other hand, it introduces advanced technologies such as AI, big data, BCI, etc. to optimize therapies. There are already interdisciplinary collaborations in the world dedicated to the development of so-called \"digital vaccines\", i.e. the prevention and reduction of addictive behaviors through gamified digital therapeutics. China also attaches great importance to related research, and new methods have emerged that integrate virtual reality exposure therapy, mobile app follow-up, and wearable device monitoring. However, there is currently a lack of a unified platform to integrate brain imaging, brain-computer interfaces, cognitive training, and AI decision support. This project proposes to build an \"artificial consciousness and human-machine collaborative intervention platform\", which is an innovative measure in line with this development trend, and its ultimate goal is to achieve all-round and whole-process intelligent intervention for addicts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"DIKWP-Artificial-Consciousness-Model-and-Advances-in-Semantic-Technology\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#DIKWP-Artificial-Consciousness-Model-and-Advances-in-Semantic-Technology\" title=\"DIKWP Artificial Consciousness Model and Advances in Semantic Technology\"></a><strong>DIKWP Artificial Consciousness Model and Advances in Semantic Technology</strong></h2><p><strong>The DIKWP artificial consciousness model</strong> :D IKWP model is composed of five layers: Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom and Purpose, which is an artificial consciousness framework that integrates cognition and semantics. Professor Yucong Duan's team was the first to propose this model, which enables AI to have an intrinsic representation and drive of the ultimate goal by adding a \"Purpose\" layer to the traditional DIKW architecture. The model adopts a network structure rather than a linear hierarchy, and there is a two-way semantic feedback between the layers: the perception data at the lower level can be gradually upgraded to the high-level abstraction, and the high-level purpose can also guide the selection and processing of low-level information. This feature makes the DIKWP model very suitable for causal chain analysis and decision interpretability studies of complex behaviors. For example, under the DIKWP framework, we can think of addictive behavior as the result of a combination of the data layer (sensory stimuli and physiological signals), the information layer (environmental cues and situations), the knowledge layer (the individual's past experience and memory), the wisdom layer (the assessment and balance of the consequences of the behavior), and the purpose layer (intrinsic motivation and goals). The interaction of each layer forms a semantic behavioral causal chain: for example, environmental triggers (I) trigger memory craving (K), weakens long-term hazard cognition through value judgment (W), and finally executes the seeking behavior (D behavior output) driven by purpose (P). This hierarchical description helps us identify key nodes in the chain of addictive behaviors (e.g., identifying cognitive biases in the \"knowledge layer\" or value shifts in the \"purpose layer\" that are driving addiction) and develop targeted interventions.</p>\n<p>The DIKWP model is also accompanied by the development of a series of key technologies: (1) <strong>Dual-cycle architecture</strong>: adding metacognitive loops in addition to the basic cognitive processes to realize AI self-monitoring and self-regulation is considered to be an important path to give AI initial self-awareness. (2) <strong>Interpretable Cognitive Operating System (ACOS): The</strong> DIKWP model is embedded in the AI system to form a \"semantic operating system\", and the reasoning process of the large model is divided into five monitorable links: D, I, K, W, and P, and each step has a mathematical definition, so as to realize the traceability of the whole process of AI decision-making. (3) <strong>Complex semantic network and energy/information coupling</strong>:D IKWP supports the construction of multimodal semantic graphs, coupling the internal cognitive state with the external environment information/energy, and facilitates AI adaptive collaboration in scenarios such as the Internet of Things and brain-computer interfaces. (4) <strong>LLM semantic adaptation</strong>: To solve the problem of illusion and purpose shift of large language models (LLMs), DIKWP provides structured prompts and multi-round dialogue semantic control to enhance the controllability of LLMs. The above technological developments show that the DIKWP model is becoming practical and systematic, providing new ideas for AI applications in various fields.</p>\n<p>In addition to the DIKWP model, other theories (such as global workspace theory IIT, attention mediation theory, etc.) have emerged in the international research of artificial consciousness, but the outstanding feature of DIKWP is the introduction of <strong>the Purpose layer and semantic feedback mechanism</strong>, giving it a unique edge in cognitive modeling and explainable AI. As the inventor of the model, Professor Yucong Duan, an academician of the International Academy of Advanced Technology and Engineering, has been granted more than 100 patents, covering fields ranging from large model training and cognitive operating systems to AI governance and security. The DIKWP model and its artificial consciousness system were also unveiled on academic platforms such as the first World Artificial Consciousness Conference in 2023, becoming one of the frontier topics in the research of \"explainability\" and \"value alignment\" of artificial intelligence. It is foreseeable that in the future evolution of AI to human-like intelligence, the DIKWP model is expected to become a key basic framework, leading the transformation of AI systems from \"tools\" to \"self-aware agents\".</p>\n<p><strong>Semantic Communication and Semantic-Driven Programming</strong>: Some derivative ideas are also being formed around the DIKWP model. Semantic communication refers to the transmission of high-level semantics instead of low-level bits in a communication system, thereby improving efficiency and intelligence. This is a hot topic in the field of 6G communication and human-computer interaction. A DIKWP-based semantic communication system (DIKWP-SC) has been proposed, which uses the subconscious layer (D/I/K) to automatically process semantics, and the consciousness layer (W/P) to make abstract decisions, so as to realize the purpose understanding and active fusion in the process of information transmission. The \"Consciousness Bug Theory\" has also been used to improve the security mechanism to ensure that the information in semantic communication is transmitted efficiently without introducing semantic distortion or malicious purpose. This is instructive for the data transmission of brain-computer interfaces and the communication of patient semantic feedback in this project, that is, semantic layer understanding should be integrated into the signal exchange, irrelevant data should be filtered, useful information should be extracted, and the purpose should be ensured.</p>\n<p><strong>In terms of semantic-driven programming, the</strong> DIKWP model is being used to develop a new generation of programming paradigms. Traditional programming regards the problem as a process of input-&gt;-processing-&gt; output, while artificial consciousness programming requires a five-layer structure of DIKWP in each stage of input, processing, and output, and the global solution is driven by the top-level purpose. This means that the program is no longer the execution of fixed instructions, but an autonomous solution process with a \"purpose\". The key steps include mapping all inputs to the DIKWP structure content (aware of the purpose), waking up and satisfying the desired purpose of the output during processing. The Purpose driver makes the program run in a loop: the Purpose guides the parsing of inputs, information extraction, knowledge reasoning, and Wisdom decision-making. This paradigm allows the system to be self-regulating and self-explanatory, which is very suitable for the development of intelligent intervention systems that we need. For example, we can design a semantic-driven decision-making engine for the withdrawal intervention platform: dynamically adjust the intervention strategy W to meet the final rehabilitation goal P according to the patient's different state inputs (physiological data D, behavioral information I, medical history knowledge K, etc.). This kind of program can continuously evaluate its own effect during operation (Wisdom layer self-reflection) and adjust the strategy (Purpose layer correction) to form a closed-loop optimization.</p>\n<p>Overall, the development of the DIKWP artificial consciousness model and its related semantic technologies provides a new toolbox for this project. By applying these cutting-edge concepts, we can introduce semantic-level analysis and control into the complex system of addiction neural mechanisms and interventions, which is expected to break through the limitations of traditional methods and achieve more comprehensive and in-depth research and more efficient and intelligent interventions.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Scientific-issues-key-technical-challenges-and-innovations\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Scientific-issues-key-technical-challenges-and-innovations\" title=\"Scientific issues, key technical challenges and innovations\"></a><strong>Scientific issues, key technical challenges and innovations</strong></h1><p>Based on the above review, it can be clarified that the core scientific problems and key technical challenges to be solved in this project are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Unified modeling of cross-level causal mechanisms of addictive behavior</strong>: Addiction involves multi-level mechanisms from molecular to behavioral, and traditional research is mostly limited to a certain scale. The overarching scientific question for this project is how to integrate neuromolecular**/cellular changes, brain circuit dynamics, and cognitive/behavioral processes within a unified framework** to build a cross-level causal model of addictive behavior? This requires breaking through the semantic divide at different levels of data and linking biological mechanisms to psychological processes. The key challenge is: how can multi-source heterogeneous data (e.g., molecular pathways, physiological signals, cognitive assessments) be semantically integrated? How does brain imaging and behavioral data map to the layers of the DIKWP model? The innovation lies in the introduction of the DIKWP artificial consciousness model as a bridge, and its semantic network is used to associate neural activity with behavioral purpose, so as to construct a semantic causal chain model of addictive behavior for the first time. This model will shed, for example, how the downregulation of dopamine receptors affects cognitive control (knowledge layer) through the meso-circuit and ultimately leads to the development of relapsing behaviors (purpose-driven behaviors).</p>\n<p><strong>2. Analysis of the semantic mechanism of existing withdrawal drugs and interventions</strong>: At present, the mechanisms and action networks of various detoxification drugs and psychotherapies have not been systematically compared. The second scientific question to be answered in this project is: How can semantic modeling and intelligent reasoning be used to comprehensively unravel the mechanisms and limitations of existing withdrawal interventions? The technical challenge is that it is necessary to construct a semantic knowledge graph covering information such as various drug targets, neural pathways, symptom improvement and side effects, as well as the cognitive process chain affected by different psychological interventions. This requires AI to perform complex causal reasoning, such as \"what is the pathway of a drug to reduce craving, and what is the causal basis of its side effects (depression, etc.)\". The innovation lies in the use of the knowledge layer and the wisdom layer of the DIKWP model to formally represent and cause and effect the knowledge of these mechanisms, and find out the shortcomings of each intervention (such as only acting on the reward pathway but ignoring the emotional pathway) and the causes of side effects (such as blocking the chain of cognitive decline caused by specific receptors). This is the first time that artificial conscious semantic reasoning has been used for comparative analysis of addiction intervention mechanisms, which can provide a basis for improving existing therapies.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Semantic-driven design of new withdrawal intervention strategies</strong>: Innovative interventions are needed after the limitations of existing therapies are discovered. The third core question is: how to design and optimize new intervention molecules or strategies based on semantic-driven models? This involves two aspects: one is molecular design, that is, the discovery of new compounds with specific semantic functions (e.g., \"attenuation of reward memory\" or \"enhancement of cognitive control purpose\"); The second is the design of non-pharmacological strategies, such as new cognitive training paradigms or stimulation protocols. Key technical challenges include translating semantic targets into specific molecular structures or interventions. We need to develop a semantic-&gt; molecular mapping method, which may use knowledge graphs and generative models to identify biological targets that can achieve predetermined semantic effects, and then generate or screen molecules based on them. At the same time, a simulation environment needs to be established to evaluate the effectiveness of these new protocols on animal models or virtual patients. The innovation lies in proposing <strong>a \"semantic-driven drug innovation model</strong>\": unlike traditional empirical screening or blind machine learning, we design new drugs/new protocols guided by a clear semantic mechanism of action, and use artificial awareness models for simulation feedback optimization. This will introduce a new paradigm of rational design in the field of addiction treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Semantic spatial representation and intervention of behavioral addiction</strong>: Compared with substance addiction, game and gambling addiction emphasize more cognitive-affective processes. The fourth question that needs to be solved in this project is: how to construct a semantic space model of behavioral addiction under the DIKWP framework and use artificial consciousness agents to intervene and simulate it? The technical challenge is that behavioral addiction lacks direct physiological drives, so its semantic representation needs to capture factors such as cognitive biases (e.g., the gambler's fallacy), mood swings, and social environment, and map these high-dimensional factors to the state within the artificial consciousness model (knowledge/wisdom layer). At the same time, we want to have AI agents \"play\" the addict and test the effects of different interventions (e.g., time limits, financial penalties, mindfulness reminders) in a virtual environment. The difficulty that needs to be solved is the simulation of the causal chain network across brain regions, and how artificial consciousness models produce decision-making biases and correction processes similar to those of humans. The innovation lies in the construction of an \"<strong>artificial consciousness addiction</strong>\", that is, to let the AI present the cognitive and behavioral characteristics of the addict in the semantic space, and then apply intervention strategies to it to observe the outcome. This approach will provide a safer and more controllable testing ground than real-life experiments for pre-assessing the effectiveness and potential problems of interventions, and is an original tool for behavioral addiction research.</p>\n<p><strong>5. The construction of artificial consciousness and human-machine collaborative intervention platform</strong>: Ultimately, we hope to integrate the above models and methods into clinical applications. The fifth question is: how to build a collaborative intervention platform that integrates artificial consciousness AI and human therapists**/patients to achieve the integration and closed-loop control of multi-modal information? Technical challenges include: simultaneous acquisition and analysis of multi-source data (brain imaging, EEG, behavior, subjective feedback);** real-time decision-making and safety monitoring of the Artificial Consciousness Operating System (ACOS); and the effectiveness of the human-computer interface (ensuring that AI recommendations are understood and adopted by physicians and patients). In particular, safety and controllability need to be addressed: AI must be explainable and ethical in intervention decision-making, and avoid the adverse effects that may be caused by false feedback. Our innovative approach is based on DIKWP's \"semantic operating system\" technology, which divides each step of intervention decision into supervised semantic units, which are reviewed by clinical experts or verified by pre-set rules, so as to ensure the safety and reliability of interventions. The platform will integrate the neuroimaging/brain-computer interface input module, semantic behavior analysis module, artificial consciousness decision-making module and feedback execution module to form a closed-loop intervention ecology. This is a first-of-its-kind artificial awareness-driven addiction intervention system that is groundbreaking in terms of technology integration and clinical utility.</p>\n<p>In summary, the innovation of this project is reflected in the following: <strong>the artificial consciousness (DIKWP) model is comprehensively applied to the study of addiction mechanism and intervention</strong>, and the semantic link from the basic neural circuit to the high-level cognitive behavior is opened; develop semantic-driven analysis and design approaches to enable in-depth causal analysis of existing therapies and rational innovation of new therapies; Build a platform for artificial consciousness and human-machine collaboration, and open up a new model of intelligent withdrawal intervention. These are the first of their kind at home and abroad, and are expected to have an important impact at the intersection of addiction science and artificial intelligence.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Research-objectives-and-key-questions-to-be-addressed\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-objectives-and-key-questions-to-be-addressed\" title=\"Research objectives and key questions to be addressed\"></a><strong>Research objectives and key questions to be addressed</strong></h1><p>Focusing on the above scientific issues and challenges, the project establishes the following overarching and decomposition objectives:</p>\n<p><strong>The overall goal is</strong> to develop an innovative method of addiction mechanism analysis and intervention strategy based on the DIKWP artificial consciousness model, and to build a platform that integrates multi-level semantic modeling and intelligent intervention feedback. Theoretically, the cross-level semantic causal mechanism of addictive behavior is revealed. In terms of methodology, this paper breaks through the bottleneck of existing addiction intervention technology and proposes a new semantic-driven intervention program. In terms of application, the demonstration application of artificial consciousness model in human-machine collaborative withdrawal intervention is realized.</p>\n<p>Specific sub-objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Objective 1</strong>: To establish a multi-level semantic model of the neural mechanisms of addiction. The molecular pathways, neural circuits, and cognitive processes related to addiction are mapped into the semantic elements of each layer of the DIKWP model to form a computable behavioral dynamics model and a semantic causal chain. The model was used to explain the internal mechanism of typical addictive behaviors (such as craving and relapse), and its explanatory power for experimental observations was verified. <strong>Indicators</strong>: Construct at least one semantic model of substance addiction (e.g., opioids) and one set of behavioral addiction (e.g., game addiction); The model was able to reproduce key phenomena reported in the literature (e.g., increased cravings due to dopamine changes caused by a drug).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Aim 2</strong>: To develop a semantic analysis and reasoning system for withdrawal interventions. Based on the knowledge graph and causal reasoning, the DIKWP semantic communication and reasoning framework was introduced to model the mechanism semantic modeling of 3-5 major detoxification drugs and psychotherapies, and find out their respective paths and limitations. <strong>Indicators</strong>: mapping the semantic causal network for each intervention; At least 3 hypotheses of unspecified causes of side effects or failures should be put forward and consistent with the literature data (e.g., the prediction relationship in the knowledge graph was verified by association analysis).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Objective 3</strong>: To propose new interventions and programmes. Using a semantic-driven approach to drug design, several candidate molecules or interventions are generated to target unmet semantic goals (e.g., alleviate abstinent negative emotions during withdrawal, enhance cognitive control). The effect was evaluated through molecular docking simulation, animal experiments, etc. <strong>Indicators</strong>: At least one new compound was found to show superior withdrawal efficacy (e.g., 30% reduction in recurrence rate and reduction of side effects) in animal model trials (e.g., reduction in relapse rate &gt; 30%); or design a new cognitive training/brain stimulation regimen that has been shown to be feasible in animal or small clinical trials (e.g., prolonging the latency for relapse of addictive behaviors).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Objective 4</strong>: To build an artificial consciousness simulation and intervention test platform for behavioral addiction. For game addiction and gambling addiction, artificial consciousness agents were developed to simulate their cognitive-emotional-reward processes, and the effects of multiple interventions (such as limiting, reward substitution, and cognitive correction) were tested in a virtual environment. <strong>Indicators</strong>: The platform can simulate the behavior change curve of addicts under different interventions; Consistent with trends in real-world clinical interventions (e.g., simulations show that time restriction significantly reduces gaming addictive behaviors, which is consistent with clinical observations). The intervention effect evaluation report was output to provide a quantitative basis for the actual intervention strategy.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Objective 5</strong>: Develop a prototype system for human-machine collaborative withdrawal intervention in artificial consciousness. It integrates EEG/brain imaging acquisition module, DIKWP semantic analysis engine, and treatment interactive interface to realize real-time status monitoring, intelligent feedback, and therapy recommendations for addicts. Conduct a small sample trial to evaluate the feasibility of the system. <strong>Indicators</strong>: The prototype system integrates brain-computer interface to achieve &gt;70% accuracy of brain state recognition (e.g., accurate recognition craving); Individualized feedback to the patient meets safety norms and is assessed by experts to aid withdrawal (e.g., the patient's self-reported cravings are less intense than before the system was used); The software and hardware of the system run stably and pass the technical appraisal.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Through the realization of the above sub-goals, the scientific questions raised by the project will be gradually answered, and the expected innovation breakthroughs of the project will be achieved. The objectives of each part of the project support each other: the mechanism model provides the theoretical basis, the semantic analysis finds the direction of improvement, the new scheme design and simulation verify its effectiveness, and finally integrates it into the intervention system to apply the verification. This closed loop from theory, &gt; method, &gt; application ensures the implementation of project objectives and the transformation of results.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Research-content-and-technical-route\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-content-and-technical-route\" title=\"Research content and technical route\"></a><strong>Research content and technical route</strong></h1><p>In order to achieve the above goals, this project intends to set up five research directions (tasks), corresponding to the research content described in the guide: (1) multi-level analysis of addiction mechanisms, (2) semantic modeling of withdrawal drugs, (3) semantic-driven intervention innovation, (4) semantic modeling and simulation of behavioral addiction, and (5) integration of artificial awareness intervention platform. The main contents, technical routes and innovation points of each research direction are as follows:</p>\n<h2 id=\"Research-Direction-1-Analysis-of-the-neural-mechanism-of-addiction-behavior-based-on-artificial-consciousness-model\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-Direction-1-Analysis-of-the-neural-mechanism-of-addiction-behavior-based-on-artificial-consciousness-model\" title=\"Research Direction 1: Analysis of the neural mechanism of addiction behavior based on artificial consciousness model\"></a><strong>Research Direction 1: Analysis of the neural mechanism of addiction behavior based on artificial consciousness model</strong></h2><p><strong>Main contents</strong>: Using the DIKWP artificial consciousness framework, this paper explores the neuromolecular, cellular and circuit mechanisms of substance addiction and behavioral addiction, and establishes behavioral dynamics and semantic causal chain models. Specifically, it includes: (1) collecting and collating neurobiological data related to addiction (neuronal firing, changes in neurotransmitter levels, strength of brain connectivity, etc.) and behavioral data (craving scores, behavior frequency, etc.); and (2) mapping these data to the five-layer elements of the DIKWP model. For example, electrophysiology and imaging data are used as \"data (D) layers\", which are extracted into \"information (I) layers\" (such as enhanced activity in specific brain regions) through patterns, and then associated with existing knowledge bases (known knowledge of addiction circuits) to form \"knowledge (K) layers\" representations, and value evaluation and trade-offs are given to form \"Wisdom (W) layers\" to make judgments, and finally correspond to the individual's motivational Purpose \"P layer\" (such as the strong purpose of continuing to seek medicine). (3) Based on this, the addiction semantic network model is constructed, with nodes representing the concepts of each layer of DIKWP and edges representing causality or correlation (e.g., \"reduced hippocampal plasticity (K)→ reduced long-term return evaluation (W) → weakened abstinence determination (P)\"); (4) The system dynamics method is used to quantitatively simulate the semantic network to analyze the key causal paths and its influence on behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical route</strong>: We will combine knowledge graph and differential equation modeling. Firstly, the knowledge graph of addiction mechanism was constructed, and the biological mechanism and cognitive role reported in the literature were woven into a net. Then, causal inference algorithms (such as structural equation model or dynamic Bayesian network) are introduced to give the graph quantitative relationship, so as to deduce the overall effect from a certain node change. Semantic-driven simulation: Set different initial states of \"purpose\" (e.g., strong craving vs. no craving), observe the evolution of each layer of state in the model, and verify whether it reproduces the actual characteristics of addictive behavior. If necessary, reinforcement learning algorithms are introduced to allow AI agents to learn strategies on the model to better fit the trajectory of real behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>Innovation:</strong> For the first time, the artificial consciousness model is applied to the unified modeling of addiction mechanism, and the <strong>integrated simulation of bio-psychological processes is realized</strong>. Traditionally, neural circuit models and behavioral models have been in different domains, but we use DIKWP as a bridge to integrate the two into a complete chain from data to purpose. This not only facilitates understanding, but also provides a new means of validating causality: by manipulating nodes at a certain level in the model, it is possible to predict the impact of the corresponding intervention on the overall behavior. This lays the foundation for the design of follow-up intervention strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Results</strong>: 1 report on the semantic model of addiction mechanism (substance addiction and behavioral addiction) was formed, and related papers were published. The model will reveal at least two or more previously unidentified causal chains of addiction and validate them through animal experiments or big data analysis (e.g., the model predicts that the chain of \"decreased prefrontal lobe function leads to weak willpower (P)\", which can be supported by data from the prefrontal inhibition test of addicts).</p>\n<h2 id=\"Research-Direction-2-DIKWP-Semantic-Modeling-and-Intelligent-Reasoning-for-Withdrawal-Drugs-and-Therapies\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-Direction-2-DIKWP-Semantic-Modeling-and-Intelligent-Reasoning-for-Withdrawal-Drugs-and-Therapies\" title=\"Research Direction 2: DIKWP Semantic Modeling and Intelligent Reasoning for Withdrawal Drugs and Therapies\"></a><strong>Research Direction 2: DIKWP Semantic Modeling and Intelligent Reasoning for Withdrawal Drugs and Therapies</strong></h2><p><strong>Main contents</strong>: To establish a semantic model of DIKWP for the existing major withdrawal interventions (including drugs and psychotherapy), and to analyze its mechanism of action, scope of application and causal chain of side effects. Typical cases: drugs such as methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone; Psychological aspects such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Mindfulness Meditation, etc. Specific steps: (1) collect mechanistic information (drug target receptors, physiological effects, therapeutic effects on cognition, etc.) and efficacy data (success rate, side effect rate, etc.) of each intervention method; (2) The intervention means were regarded as some intervention input to the semantic model of addiction, and the DIKWP model was used to model its process. For example, methadone replacement therapy can be represented as the input of a stimulus that activates μ-opioid receptors at the data layer, which in turn produces a judgment in the Wisdom layer that alleviates withdrawal pain, but may not change the motivation for addiction at the Purpose layer; CBT is modeled as the adjustment of the knowledge layer and the wisdom layer, that is, correcting the over-perception of drug benefits, enhancing the trade-off of withdrawal benefits, etc., so as to change the decision-making tendency of the Purpose layer. (3) The inference algorithm was used to deduce the limitations of intervention methods and the formation mechanism of side effects. For example, through model simulation, it was found that naltrexone blocking reward may also block the natural reward pathway, resulting in anhedonia. CBT requires a high degree of patient cooperation, and its effect depends on the initiative of the Purpose layer, and the efficacy of the model will be reduced if the motivation of the Purpose layer is insufficient.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical route</strong>: Construct a knowledge graph of withdrawal intervention, with nodes including drugs, targets, symptoms, cognitive processes, etc., and relationships including \"acting on\", \"inducing\", \"alleviating\" and \"side effects\". Combining logical reasoning and causal analysis: using rule-based reasoning (e.g., descriptive logic) to obtain the direct impact of the intervention, and then using the causal network approach to find out the chain of indirect effects. The key is to use the DIKWP model to clarify how the intervention acts on which layer of the five-layer structure, so as to locate its effects and shortcomings. For example, methadone acts on physiological D and I layers (reducing data input for withdrawal symptoms), but does not affect the memory of K layer and the value judgment of W layer, so the recurrence rate is still high; Conversely, a perfect intervention should work at the W and P levels (change values and wills). We formalized this concept as a criterion for evaluating each intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Innovation</strong>: Traditionally, the evaluation of withdrawal drugs/therapies has mostly been based on empirical statistics and single-point mechanism analysis. This study introduces a new method of semantic causal analysis, and comprehensively examines the chain of action and blind spots of interventions through artificial consciousness models. This approach can explain why certain interventions are working/not working and predict how they can be improved. For example, it can explain why patients may still crave naltrexone even with naltrexone (because the Purpose layer is unaffected) and predict that \"success may be increased if the combination of psychological interventions strengthens Purpose control\". Such reasoning has not been shown in existing studies.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Results</strong>: Construction of semantic knowledge base and model of withdrawal intervention; Write a semantic analysis report of the intervention mechanism and make recommendations for improvement for each therapy. At least one set of intelligent question-answering or decision support archetypes: input patient characteristics and optional interventions, and the system can suggest a recommended strategy based on semantic reasoning (e.g., for patients with high anxiety, model inference emphasizes mindfulness training to alleviate stress and help boost willingness). These results will be published/applied in the form of papers and patents, and will provide guidance for the subsequent design of new therapies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Research-Direction-3-Design-and-validation-of-semantic-driven-novel-intervention-molecules-and-protocols\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-Direction-3-Design-and-validation-of-semantic-driven-novel-intervention-molecules-and-protocols\" title=\"Research Direction 3: Design and validation of semantic-driven novel intervention molecules and protocols\"></a><strong>Research Direction 3: Design and validation of semantic-driven novel intervention molecules and protocols</strong></h2><p><strong>Main content</strong>: To explore new intervention strategies based on the identification of existing therapeutic limitations. This includes the design of new drug molecules and the development of new non-drug interventions, all guided by semantic goals. Steps: (1) According to the results of research direction 2, identify the unmet key therapeutic semantic needs, such as: \"selectively inhibit craving memory reconsolidation\", \"enhance the regulation of impulses in the prefrontal lobe\", \"alleviate anxiety and depression in withdrawal period\", etc.; (2) Determine the biological target or intervention pathway hypothesis for each need. For example, inhibition of memory reconsolidation could consider blocking specific signaling pathways between the hippocampus-amygdala; To enhance cognitive control, consider boosting prefrontal dopamine or utilizing transcranial stimulation; (3) New drug design: using the method of knowledge graph + model generation, the candidates who meet the conditions are screened and optimized in the huge compound space. Knowledge graphs provide target-pathway-action relationship constraints, and generative models (such as deep generative networks or reinforcement learning) produce molecules with desired properties. For example, in order to achieve the effect of \"increasing prefrontal dopamine without overactivating the nucleus accumbens\", we designed molecules that specifically excitate D1 receptors and moderately cross the blood-brain barrier; (4) Non-drug program design: propose a new cognitive training or stimulation program based on artificial consciousness simulation. For example, having addicts perform specific tasks in a VR environment to reshape reward estimates, or designing brain-computer interface closed-loop stimulation strategies that automatically give negative frontal feedback to inhibit impulses when a craving signal is detected. Virtual addiction agents are used to test the effects of these regimens and select the best ones for validation in animal experiments or clinical trials.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical route</strong>: For the design of new drug molecules, a cross-cutting approach is adopted: first, knowledge-driven screening (using known pharmacological knowledge to narrow the search scope, such as locking a certain class of receptor ligands), and then AI generative optimization (generating molecules that meet multi-parameter optimization through deep learning models). In particular, a semantic scoring function is introduced: unlike the traditional optimization of IC50 or ADMET alone, we will define a semantic score for the molecule, such as \"both inhibiting craving without diminishing natural reward\", which requires a synthesis of multi-target modes of action and calculation using knowledge graph reasoning. During the optimization process, the AI tries different structures and evaluates them with semantic scores until the polymer is found. For the design of the new scheme, human-computer confrontation simulation was adopted: the artificial consciousness addiction agent interacted with the intervention AI, and the strategy was continuously improved in the simulated environment. This is similar to adversary learning in reinforcement learning, allowing the intervention AI to learn the optimal strategy. The whole route takes semantic goals as the core evaluation criteria.</p>\n<p><strong>Innovation:</strong> The traditional research and development of new drugs takes a long time and has no clear direction, but the \"semantic-driven drug design\" proposed in this study deduces drug characteristics from the semantic requirements of efficacy, which significantly narrows the search space and improves the pertinence. At the same time, we use artificial consciousness models for intervention strategy inventions, which break through the limitations of human experience and may generate unexpected new solutions. For example, an AI may find that a unique training sequence or stimulus waveform is more effective than artificially assumed. This idea of \"creating\" an intervention method by AI is the first of its kind in the field of withdrawal and is a disruptive innovation.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Results</strong>: Acquisition of at least 1-2 promising new compounds (patent application completed) and 1 novel intervention program (e.g., VR+BCI training program, application for software copyright or patent). Small-scale animal trials verified that the new molecule showed significantly better effects than existing drugs in animal models of addiction (statistically significant p&lt;0.05), or that the new behavioral intervention program showed better adherence and preliminary efficacy in volunteers. Publish high-level papers to explain the design methods and experimental results, and lay the foundation for further clinical research.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Research-Direction-4-DIKWP-Semantic-Space-Modeling-and-Intervention-Simulation-of-Game-and-Gambling-Addiction\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-Direction-4-DIKWP-Semantic-Space-Modeling-and-Intervention-Simulation-of-Game-and-Gambling-Addiction\" title=\"Research Direction 4: DIKWP Semantic Space Modeling and Intervention Simulation of Game and Gambling Addiction\"></a><strong>Research Direction 4: DIKWP Semantic Space Modeling and Intervention Simulation of Game and Gambling Addiction</strong></h2><p><strong>Main contents</strong>: The DIKWP artificial consciousness model was applied to the field of behavioral addiction, and the semantic space model of online game addiction and gambling addiction was constructed, and artificial intelligence simulation experiments were developed to test the effect of different intervention strategies at the semantic level. Specific work: (1) Construct cognitive-affective semantic models of game addiction and gambling addiction. Relevant research data were collected, such as abnormal brain function areas of game addicts, types of cognitive biases (such as probability distortions) of gambling addicts, etc., and expressed as various layers of DIKWP elements: the data layer included sensory stimuli (game rewards, gambling stimuli) and physiological responses (dopamine release, etc.) in addiction situations; The information layer is the extracted features (win-loss feedback frequency, reward uncertainty, etc.); The knowledge layer includes the individual's understanding of rules and probabilities, and the memory of past experience. The Wisdom layer involves its assessment of risk and benefit, as well as emotional responses (e.g., excitement or frustration); The purpose layer is the motivation to continuously engage in behavior (escapism or pleasure pursuit); (2) Build an artificial consciousness simulation environment: make an artificial intelligence agent act in a simulated game or gambling environment with the DIKWP model as the \"psychological framework\". Agents have addiction-like preferences and limitations (by adjusting their knowledge/wisdom layer parameters such as high discount rate, low loss aversion, etc.). Engaging agents in simulated gaming/gambling tasks that create addictive behavioural traits (e.g., a cycle of losing and gambling); (3) Introduce different intervention strategy simulations, such as setting betting limits (external constraints, equivalent to limiting the intensity of stimuli at the data layer), increasing risk reminders (providing real probability information at the knowledge layer), and introducing a delay reward mechanism (changing the evaluation of instant rewards at the Wisdom layer). Observe the agent's behavior and internal state changes, such as the number of bets, stop probability, sentiment indicators, etc.; (4) Analyze the links of each intervention that work within the model and compare their effectiveness. If a strategy is found to significantly reduce the purpose of continuing to gamble on the P layer, it is considered effective.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical route</strong>: Agent-based modeling and simulation method is adopted. Develop a simulation environment (which can be reduced to a classic Iowa gambling task or reinforcement learning environment) to engage agents with DIKWP decision architecture. The agent's decision-making is determined by the internal five layers: we will design brain-like sub-modules for it (e.g., the \"reward evaluation module\" corresponds to the Wisdom layer, and the \"impulse control module\" corresponds to the Purpose layer regulation). Trans-brain causal models were introduced into the simulation, such as setting \"when the reward appears, the surrogate nucleus accumbens (simulated reward) activation is enhanced, while the prefrontal control is weakened\" to realistically reproduce the addiction decision. Different interventions are achieved by changing the parameters or inputs of these modules. Run a large number of simulation statistics and apply reinforcement learning algorithms to find the best combination of interventions. Finally, the simulation conclusions are validated with the necessary human data, such as comparing them with experimental results in the literature.</p>\n<p><strong>Innovation</strong>: This is the first time that the artificial consciousness model has been used in an in vivo simulation experiment for behavioral addiction intervention. Traditional psychological research can only be done through trial and error in real people, but this task establishes a \"digital testing ground\". The combination of human-like cognitive biases and machine-observable internal states allows us to open the \"black box\" to see how interventions affect the agent's intrinsic semantic layer changes (e.g., how prompt information changes their knowledge-level cognition). This provides unique causal insights and predictive capabilities. Especially for interventions with ethical or practical limitations, we can first evaluate them in simulation. For example, the effects of coercive measures on agents in extreme situations can be simulated without the need for real human experimentation. This innovative approach is expected to become a new paradigm in behavioral addiction research.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Results</strong>: Completed the development of 1 set of software of \"Artificial Awareness Simulation Platform for Behavioral Addiction\"; Simulation models and intervention effect reports for at least two addictive behaviors were given. The report will list the magnitude of the impact of various strategies on the agent behavior indicators and recommend the best solution. For example, we may find that the combination of \"limiting game time + immediate feedback of real loss\" is more effective in correcting game addiction behaviors, which can inform policymaking. The results were published in the form of academic papers and conference reports, which enhanced the influence in the field of behavioral addiction modeling in China.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Research-Direction-5-Construction-of-Addiction-Intervention-Mechanism-Platform-of-Artificial-Consciousness-and-Human-Computer-Collaboration\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-Direction-5-Construction-of-Addiction-Intervention-Mechanism-Platform-of-Artificial-Consciousness-and-Human-Computer-Collaboration\" title=\"Research Direction 5: Construction of Addiction Intervention Mechanism Platform of Artificial Consciousness and Human-Computer Collaboration\"></a><strong>Research Direction 5: Construction of Addiction Intervention Mechanism Platform of Artificial Consciousness and Human-Computer Collaboration</strong></h2><p><strong>Main contents</strong>: Based on the above research results, a human-computer intervention platform driven by artificial consciousness is developed to realize the human-machine collaboration of multiple intervention methods. The platform includes: data collection layer (physiological and behavioral data obtained by neuroimaging, EEG, and wearable sensing), semantic analysis layer (DIKWP artificial consciousness operating system, multi-level semantic analysis of data), decision-making layer (giving personalized intervention decisions according to semantic causal models), and execution layer (acting on patients through APP, VR, brain stimulation equipment, etc., and collecting feedback). The platform will integrate specific functional modules such as: <strong>neuroimaging + AI monitoring module (using fMRI/EEG to detect brain craving-related patterns, which are interpreted into semantic signals by AI in real time), brain-computer interface feedback module</strong> (when high craving states are detected, automatically triggering such as transcranial electrical stimulation to reduce excitability, or reminding patients to perform mindfulness exercises through visual/auditory signals), and <strong>digital cognitive training module</strong>(gamified tasks are provided for patients to improve cognitive control, and AI adjusts the difficulty of tasks based on patient completion), <strong>therapist collaboration interface</strong> (AI analysis and recommendations are presented to clinicians in an interpretable form, such as annotating the current stage of addiction and recommended intervention strategies). Through the collaboration of these modules, a closed-loop intervention is established: the cycle of monitoring-analysis-intervention-re-monitoring is similar to the sensing-planning-execution closed-loop in autonomous driving, but applied to withdrawal support.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical</strong> roadmap: The platform development will follow a modular architecture. Firstly, the Artificial Consciousness Operating System Kernel (<strong>ACOS) is</strong> designed, which is embedded in the DIKWP model, which is responsible for coordinating the data and semantic flow of each module. ACOS converts the data from the sensor into DIKWP content (corresponding to the perception D/I layer) and runs semantic programs (such as the models and strategies in tasks 1-4 above) to derive the Wisdom decision W and Purpose P layer outputs. To achieve this, we will use the relevant solution in Professor Yucong Duan's patent to break down the AI decision-making process into five steps that can be monitored. The modules are connected via a semantic communication interface, i.e. the information exchanged is tagged with DIKWP. For example, the EEG module outputs not only waveforms, but events labeled as \"high thirst states (layer I)\"; The cognitive training module does not require simple instructions, but the goal of \"improving willpower (P-level)\", which is translated by ACOS into specific task parameters. This semantic interface greatly improves the efficiency and intelligence of the collaboration of all parts. In terms of implementation, a microservice architecture will be adopted, with each functional component developed independently and communicated through a semantic bus.</p>\n<p>In terms of test evaluation, we will first conduct a simulation test: use the artificial consciousness agent of task 4 to simulate the patient, interact with the platform, and check the correctness and safety of the platform's decision-making logic. Then conduct a small-scale clinical trial: invite addiction survivors to participate, let the platform assist the withdrawal process for 1-3 months, and observe their experience and effect. In the process, the human-computer interaction interface and algorithm parameters are continuously improved.</p>\n<p><strong>Innovation</strong>: The platform is a groundbreaking integration: for the first time, artificial consciousness (explainable AI), brain-computer interfaces, semantic communication, and digital therapeutics are fused together to serve addiction intervention. Compared with traditional treatment, it is more real-time (real-time monitoring of brain status), **more personalized (**AI tailors strategies for each patient), and <strong>better synergy (human-machine participation in treatment decision-making). At the same time, unlike general AI systems, every decision-making step within the platform is transparent and traceable, and therapists and patients can understand what the AI did and why, thereby increasing trust and compliance. This kind of artificial consciousness-driven explainable intelligent intervention is a cutting-edge exploration in the medical field and has important demonstration significance.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Expected Results</strong>: Completed the prototype of the \"Artificial Awareness Platform for Addiction Intervention\" and passed the test; Apply for corresponding patents or software copyrights for platform software and hardware; Formation of platform usage guidelines and clinical evaluation reports. It is expected that the platform will significantly help patients improve some indicators, such as reducing subjective craving scores, prolonging the number of days of uninterrupted abstinence, etc., in the trial, with a statistically significant difference compared with the control group without using the platform. The project will summarize the experience of this innovative model and propose further large-scale clinical applications. Ultimately, we hope that the platform will lay the foundation for subsequent industrialization and become a new prototype of intelligent addiction rehabilitation equipment/systems in China.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Project-implementation-plan-and-schedule\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Project-implementation-plan-and-schedule\" title=\"Project implementation plan and schedule\"></a><strong>Project implementation plan and schedule</strong></h1><p>In order to ensure the realization of the project objectives, we formulate scientific and reasonable implementation plans and schedules.

Professor Duan's team built a DIKWP physiological and artificial consciousness prototype system, which mapped the natural language interaction and subjective cognitive process in the doctor-patient consultation scene into the DIKWP model, and realized the unified computing simulation of data, information, knowledge, wisdom and purpose in the dialogue. The DIKWP brain region mapping theory proposed by them clarifies the corresponding brain regions and roles of the five levels in the cognitive process, and uses fusion transformation technology to solve the problem of inconsistent and imprecise information in actual interaction. The prototype system successfully visualized the DIKWP semantic graph and demonstrated the interpretability advantage of the artificial consciousness model in complex cognitive tasks. These results demonstrate our ability to apply the DIKWP model to the more complex scenario of addiction, with a preliminary software and algorithmic foundation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In terms of the study of the neural mechanism of addiction, the laboratory of Professor Li, a member of the team, is the first in China to use optogenetics to describe the circuit mechanism of morphine addiction, revealing the dual effects of the VTA-IPAC pathway on reward and memory.

Theoretical and methodological achievements</strong>: The construction of semantic models of addiction neural mechanisms and intervention semantic reasoning methods have enriched and developed the application of artificial consciousness theory in the field of cognitive neuroscience. It is expected to publish more than 10 SCI papers (including no less than 3 journals in the first district of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) and several Chinese core journal papers, covering addiction semantic models, semantic-driven drug design, new intervention strategy simulation, human-computer collaboration platform, etc. This project will form a monograph or 1 chapter, systematically summarize the experience of the application of the DIKWP artificial consciousness model in brain science, and provide reference for the academic community.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Core technology and software</strong>: Develop a prototype system of \"Artificial Awareness Intervention Platform for Addiction\", including related software and hardware interfaces. In terms of software, one set of DIKWP semantic simulation platform (including addiction behavior simulation module and intervention strategy optimization module) and one intervention decision support system were delivered, with visual interface and interactive functions.

These disorders are prevalent in neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., visual and auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia), sensory system impairment (e.g., visual hallucinations in blind patients), and chronic pain syndromes (e.g., phantom limb pain, neuropathic pain), which seriously affect the quality of life of patients. However, the mechanism of its occurrence is complex and diverse, and there is a lack of effective intervention methods. <strong>This project focuses on the two typical perceptual abnormalities of vision and pain, focusing on the national key R&amp;D guideline \"3 Analysis of the neural mechanism of perceptual impairment or abnormality and the study of new treatment strategies</strong>\", and attempts to explore new intervention strategies from the multi-level integration of neural circuit mechanisms to artificial intelligence semantic models.</p>\n<p><em>Typical examples of visual perception impairments</em> include Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) and Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS). Patients with CBS experience realistic hallucinatory images due to the absence of visual input. Studies speculate that visual hallucinations originate from retinal degeneration, causing the brain to lose normal visual inhibition, so that it autonomously activates memory images to fill the field of vision. CBS has been reported in more than 12% of patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD); Nearly half of people with severe vision impairment have experienced visual hallucinations. However, there is no effective treatment for such hallucinations, and previous attempts at pharmacological intervention are not ideal, and can only rely on the patient's brain to gradually adapt to reduce hallucinations. AIWS, on the other hand, is characterized by distorted perception of the size and shape of visual objects, which is thought to be associated with abnormal multisensory connections due to migraine attacks or brain infections. These phenomena reveal that visual perceptual abnormalities often stem from the mismatch between high-level semantic integration and sensory input in the brain, but the specific neural circuit mechanism still needs to be further studied.</p>\n<p><em>In terms of pain perception impairment</em>, chronic pain and phantom limb pain are typical. Chronic neuropathic pain is listed by the World Health Organization as one of the global public health priorities. According to statistics, about one-fifth of the world's population suffers from chronic pain for a long time, and a considerable part of it is neuropathic pain (such as diabetic neuralgia, postherpetic neuralgia). Phantom limb pain is an abnormality in amputees' perception that the limb is still painful when it no longer exists, and about 64% of amputees worldwide experience phantom limb pain. Studies have found that the occurrence of phantom limb pain is closely related to the spontaneous abnormal discharge of peripheral nerve stumps and the reorganization dysregulation of the central cortex. Behind chronic hyperalgesia, scientists put forward the theory of \"central sensitization\", that is, the pain circuits of the spinal cord and brain are plastically altered, so that the pain signal is amplified and persistent. The specific mechanisms include enhanced excitatory neurotransmission in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (such as increased glutamate release and upregulation of NMDA receptors) and decreased inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA, glycine, etc.), accompanied by the activation of microglia and astrocytes to release cytokines, resulting in increased neuronal excitability and pathology. At the brain level, brain imaging studies in patients with chronic pain showed abnormal functional connectivity in pain-related areas such as the somatosensory cortex, insular lobe, and anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), and the connection between the prefrontal lobe and these areas was weakened, resulting in a decrease in the brain's ability to regulate pain and a continuous enhancement of pain experience. Existing pain treatment methods include drugs (such as opioid analgesics, antiepileptic drugs, antidepressants, etc.) and neuromodulation (such as spinal cord electrical stimulation, deep brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation). However, these therapies are often associated with significant side effects or invasive risks, and their effects are not long-lasting. For example, opioid painkillers are prone to dependence and addiction, and invasive electrical nerve stimulation carries risks such as infection and displacement, while noninvasive transcranial stimulation is short-lived and difficult to maintain in the long term. Therefore, there is an urgent need for safer and more durable new pain intervention strategies to fundamentally reshape the plasticity of abnormal pain pathways.</p>\n<p>In summary, perceptual impairments, whether visual or nociceptive, involve multiple levels of neurological changes: from molecular and cellular (abnormalities in neurotransmitters, receptors, ion channels) to neural circuits (altered synaptic plasticity, network connection reorganization) to prediction and interpretation biases at the higher cognitive level. For example, there is growing evidence that both hallucinations and chronic pain can be explained by the \"brain predictive coding\" theory, in which the inconsistency of the brain's prior expectations and sensory inputs is an important cause of symptoms. When the brain is too biased towards its own \"high expectations\" in the internal model of the environment, it may produce hallucinatory false perceptions; Similarly, excessive expectation and attention to pain can amplify the sensation of pain. For example, studies have found that giving a positive suggestion of pain relief (placebo) significantly reduces pain sensation, while negative expectations of pain (anger effect) increase pain. In hallucination studies, the application of ketamine caused mice to develop auditory-hallucination-like illusions, and confirmed that increased dopamine release from the striatum made animals rely more on internal predictions than real inputs, thus \"hearing\" signals that were not there. This cross-species study of computational psychiatry showed that <em>when modulation systems such as dopamine in the brain are out of balance, the weight of high-level intention/expectation over perception is too high, which can lead to abnormal perception</em>. This finding provides a new circuit perspective for understanding hallucinations and perceptual abnormalities, and suggests that <strong>it is possible to intervene in such symptoms by modulating the processing of purpose/desired information in</strong> the brain.</p>\n<p>Based on the above background, this project realized that in order to solve perceptual barriers, it is necessary to adopt a new multidisciplinary approach: on the one hand, it is necessary to deeply analyze the neurobiological mechanism, and on the other hand, introduce artificial consciousness models in artificial intelligence for cross-level modeling, and carry out unified description and intervention from the data layer (sensory signals) to the knowledge layer and the purpose layer (high-level cognition). Relying on the advantages of the disciplinary platform of the Active Medicine Committee of the World Association of Artificial Consciousness, this project intends to use the DIKWP artificial consciousness model (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom-Purpose) as a theoretical framework to combine biological neural mechanisms with artificial intelligence semantic cognition models to answer the following scientific questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>What are the neurogenesis mechanisms of perceptual impairment (represented by visual hallucinations and chronic pain) at the molecular, cellular, neural circuit, and systemic behavioral levels? How do the different levels of mechanisms interact to lead to the creation and maintenance of anomalous perception?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>What are the existing interventions for perceptual abnormalities (drugs, neuromodulation, psychotherapy, etc.) on the nervous system? What is the underlying cause of its limited efficacy? How can new theoretical models guide improvement strategies?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How can the DIKWP model of artificial consciousness be used to simulate the human perception process and decompose the brain's processing of perceptual information into <strong>five layers: data-information-knowledge-wisdom-purpose</strong>? Can the model be used to build a mechanism of \"anomaly recognition\" and \"semantic reasoning\" to understand and detect anomalies from the perspective of artificial intelligence?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Based on the cognitive architecture of the artificial consciousness model, how to design a digital simulation platform to realize the simulation experiment of perceptual impairment and intervention programs without the need for physical experimental equipment? What core modules (such as perceptual semantic interfaces, cognitive reconstruction engines, feedback modulation channels, etc.) are required for such a platform to operate in a closed loop?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Are there new interventions, such as semantic-driven cognitive restructuring or artificial consciousness-guided adaptive neuromodulation, that can break through the limitations of traditional drug/electrical stimulation therapies? Can the effectiveness and innovation of these new strategies be demonstrated through simulation and the necessary validation of animal behavior?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Focusing on the above problems, this project aims to propose a new research paradigm for perceptual impairment: multi-level integration research based on brain science experimental data and artificial consciousness model, so as to provide a new way to elucidate the mechanism of perceptual abnormalities and innovate therapies. This is not only of great theoretical significance (it is expected to break through the existing one-sided understanding of hallucinations and pain mechanisms), but also has potential clinical applications and industrial transformation prospects (such as the development of digital therapeutics, intelligent assisted diagnosis and treatment systems), and sets a model for the intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience. In particular, it is worth emphasizing that <strong>although this project lacks the foundation of large-scale physical experimental equipment, it is expected to achieve a breakthrough in the form of \"corner overtaking\" based on solid theoretical and model innovation</strong>, and make a leading voice in international academic dialogue.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Research-Objectives\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-Objectives\" title=\"Research Objectives:\"></a><strong>Research Objectives:</strong></h1><p>The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the neural mechanisms of visual and pain perception disorders and develop innovative intervention strategies based on artificial consciousness using the DIKWP model of artificial consciousness. The specific objectives are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Multi-level neural mechanism analysis:</strong> Using the research results of molecular biology, neuroelectrophysiology, brain imaging and behavior, this paper systematically elucidates the mechanism of visual hallucinations and chronic pain abnormalities from peripheral receptors to central nervous networks, and reveals key targets and circuit changes. He focuses on mechanisms such as synaptic plasticity changes, glial cell-mediated neuroinflammation, brain interval connection recombination, and brain prediction error processing.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Analysis of the Mechanism and Limitations of Existing Therapies: This</strong> paper summarizes the principles of action of current drugs (such as dopamine antagonists, opioids), physical stimulation (such as transcranial magnetism, spinal cord electrical stimulation) and psychological/behavioral therapies in correcting perceptual abnormalities, and analyzes their shortcomings in combination with mechanism studies. For example, why can't medication eliminate CBS hallucinations? Why is neuromodulation difficult to provide long-lasting relief of chronic pain? The DIKWP model was used to model the semantic logic of these intervention pathways, and the key links that were not touched by traditional therapies were extracted.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>DIKWP Artificial Consciousness Model Application:</strong> Build a DIKWP model implementation specifically for perceptual abnormalities, including: <strong>anomaly perception recognition module</strong> (detecting abnormal patterns output by each layer of DIKWP, such as wrong \"information\" or distorted \"Wisdom\" layer decision-making), <strong>cross-brain region semantic reasoning algorithm</strong> (simulating the role of different brain regions in knowledge and wisdom layers of semantic interaction, reconstructing the multi-region consistency required for normal perception), and an artificial consciousness operating system (<strong>OS) framework that integrates the above modules. Under this framework, the autonomous perception, self-reflection and abnormal alertness of the artificial intelligence system to external stimuli are realized, and the process of screening and correcting perceptual information by human consciousness is simulated.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Artificial Intervention Strategy and Digital Simulation Platform:</strong> Develop an interactive digital simulation platform to conduct in silico experiments on perceptual abnormalities and their interventions by using the constructed artificial consciousness OS and perceptual semantic model. The platform includes a perceptual semantic interface (which converts sensory signals in a real or simulated environment into the data layer input of the DIKWP model, and can introduce noise or anomalies to simulate pathological conditions), <strong>a cognitive reconstruction engine</strong> (dynamically adjusts the parameters or structures of each layer of the model according to the type of abnormality detected, which is equivalent to imposing interventions, such as reducing the weight of error priors, simulating drugs to block a pathway, etc.), and <strong>intervention feedback channels</strong>(Monitor the \"Wisdom\" layer results of the simulation output, i.e., the final perceived experience, evaluate the effect of the intervention and guide the next adjustment). Through repeated iterations of the platform, the optimal combination of intervention strategies was screened.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Validation and Evaluation of Innovative Therapies:</strong> 2-3 innovative intervention strategies for perceptual abnormalities are proposed on digital platforms, such as semantic-guided neurofeedback therapy (real-time reminder and correction of patients' unreasonable perceptual interpretations through artificial consciousness systems to reduce hallucinations/pain) or lead drugs (designed for newly discovered molecular targets and tested in simulation). The scheme with outstanding effect was selected and initially verified on the animal behavior model (e.g., a mouse model with a VR visual hallucination environment was constructed to test the deviation correction effect of the semantic interface; or use pain model mice to test the effects of the new drug on pain behavior and neural activity). Evaluate the effectiveness, stability, and innovation of these strategies to lay the foundation for further clinical translation.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Through the achievement of the above objectives, this project is expected to produce a new theoretical model of perceptual impairment, reveal several key mechanisms and propose original intervention pathways. On this basis, a set of systematic methods for AI-assisted perception of abnormal diagnosis and treatment will be formed, which will provide technical reserves for the future development of digital medical products (such as hallucination management assistance system, pain cognitive intervention APP, etc.).</p>\n<h1 id=\"Research-content-and-technical-route\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-content-and-technical-route\" title=\"Research content and technical route\"></a><strong>Research content and technical route</strong></h1><p>In order to achieve the research objectives, the project has designed four interconnected research content modules, each of which corresponds to a specific technical route and methodology. The research content and technical route are shown in Figure 1:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"图片描述\" src=\"/cooperation/items/media/image5.png\" style=\"width:60%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;\"/><br/><em>Figure 1: Illustration of the multi-level mechanisms by which pain perception disorders occur. The figure shows the whole process of chronic pain from peripheral inflammation-mediated peripheral sensitization, to central sensitization due to synaptic plasticity changes in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, to the reorganization of cerebral higher-level central plasticity and the imbalance of descending pain regulatory pathways. Together, these multi-layered mechanisms shape the occurrence of chronic algesia. This project will systematically investigate visual hallucinations and hyperalgesia for similar multi-level mechanisms.</em></p>\n<p><strong>1. Research on the neural circuit mechanism of perceptual impairment:</strong> Firstly, an in-depth literature survey and data analysis were carried out to sort out the neurobiological mechanism basis of visual and pain abnormalities. Through the review of relevant research in recent years, the important findings are extracted. For example, visual hallucinations focus on <strong>how spontaneous activity of the visual cortex produces visual hallucinations, the role of visual associations such as the preparietal area in hallucinations, and the influence of neurotransmitters such as 5-HT and Ach systems in visual abnormalities. In terms of pain dysphoria, the focus is on changes in the dorsal horn neural circuit of the spinal cord in pain amplification (e.g., dysregulation of excitability</strong>/inhibition), <strong>decreased modulation of pain sensation by the descending pathway of the brainstem PAG-bulbar RVM, and limbic system</strong>(such as the amygdala) role in the amplification of chronic pain, etc. If possible, we will work with relevant laboratories to obtain some experimental data, such as changes in brain networks for visual hallucinations revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and changes in neural electrical activity recorded in animal models of pain. By integrating multi-level evidence, the \"mechanism map of visual hallucinations\" and the \"mechanism map of chronic pain abnormalities\" were drawn to clarify the key molecular-cell-circuit links and interrelationships involved in each abnormality**. As shown in Figure 1, we connected the abnormal transmission of nerve impulses caused by peripheral neuropathy, the changes in spinal cord and brainstem plasticity, and the reconstruction of brain plasticity into a network to find the nodes that are most worthy of intervention.**</p>\n<p>On this basis, we apply computational modeling methods to verify some mechanisms. For example, a dynamical model can be used to simulate how increased excitability gain in a neuronal network triggers spontaneous activity (corresponding to hallucination), or a Bayesian brain model can be used to simulate how the brain perceives pain by combining a priori and evidence. These models validate the plausibility of our mechanism hypothesis, and support the hypothesis if the simulation results are consistent with the real anomaly. If the differences are significant, the understanding needs to be adjusted.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Mechanism of action and limitations of existing treatments:</strong> This content aims to answer: Why are current treatments insufficient? How to find improvement ideas in combination with mechanism research. We will classify the main treatment modalities for hallucinations and chronic pain, and analyze their sites of action at the neural circuit level</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Medications:</strong> For visual hallucinations, such as schizophrenia, antipsychotics (dopamine D2 receptor antagonists) are often used to reduce dopamine overactivity, but have no obvious effect on hallucinations caused by pure sensory loss (such as CBS); For chronic pain, typical drugs include NSAIDs (peripheral anti-inflammatory analgesics), opioids (central pain threshold increases), and anticonvulsants such as gabapentin (which reduce neuronal excitability). By reviewing pharmacological and clinical data, we will summarize the mechanisms and shortcomings of these drugs, such as long-term opioid use can trigger tolerance and addiction, and antipsychotics have limited efficacy and large side effects on visual hallucinations. Combined with the mechanism map, we analyze the links covered and the gaps that are not covered by the drug's action. For example, opioids act primarily on central μ receptors to inhibit pain signaling, but do not reverse changes in the plasticity of central sensitization, so pain may recur after discontinuation of the drug. We try to simulate drug effects using the \"data-information\" layer of the DIKWP model: think of the drug as an increase or decrease in nerve signals (data flow) or noise suppression, such as opioids that reduce the intensity of the \"pain data\" stream, dopamine antagonists that reduce the weight of false \"predictions\", etc. Through this semantic modeling, it is clear that the drug can only temporarily modulate the data**/information layer, and the** abnormal cognition** of the knowledge/wisdom layer is not corrected, which may be the reason for the easy rebound of efficacy.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Neuromodulation techniques:</strong> including invasive spinal cord stimulation (SCS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), etc. The common principle of these techniques is to directly modulate the excitability of specific neural circuits, such as SCS by transmitting array stimulation in the dorsal column of the spinal cord, activating local inhibition of intermediate neurons, thereby \"shutting down\" pain conduction; DBS administers high-frequency electrical stimulation to the thalamus or limbic system, interrupting abnormal signaling circuits; rTMS/tDCS can non-invasively alter cortical excitability. We will investigate the progress and limitations of the use of these methods in hallucinations/pain. For example, transcranial magnetic stimulation to inhibit the visual cortex to alleviate visual hallucinations has been tried in the field of visual hallucinations, but efficacy has been inconsistent; In the field of pain, rTMS stimulates the motor cortex to have a certain analgesic effect, but the effect is short-lived. Using the DIKWP model, we see neuromodulation as an external calibration of the \"information-knowledge\" layer: for example, transcranial magnetism directly changes the processing threshold of information in a certain area of the brain (e.g., reducing the production of visual cortex noise), and <strong>DBS is equivalent to a high-frequency interference of abnormal knowledge connections in the circuit, causing them to temporarily fail. However, we speculate that this type of physical means is not sustainable because the brain's</strong> purpose/destination layer drive** gradually adapts the network to external stimuli (i.e., there is tolerance or plastic rebound), so the anomaly may return after the stimulation is stopped.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Psychological and behavioral therapy:</strong> including cognitive behavioral therapy <strong>(CBT),</strong> attentional bias training, mirror therapy, etc. For example, people with phantom limb pain often use mirror therapy to \"see\" the missing limb and move it to relieve pain with the help of visual feedback. This is actually an intervention that uses visual semantics to correct pain cognition, recalibrating the brain's knowledge and purpose of pain. CBT also has some effect on patients with chronic pain and hallucinations, by guiding patients to change their cognitive and emotional responses to symptoms (i.e., adjusting the interpretation and value judgment of perception in the \"Wisdom\" layer). We will collect research data from these therapies and analyze their active ingredients. For example, mirror therapy is thought to reduce the false body image reorganization associated with phantom limb pain and restore normal connections in some parts of the sensory-motor cortex; CBT may enhance inhibition of downstream nociception/hallucination signals through the prefrontal-limbic pathway. The DIKWP model is used to interpret the behavioral**/psychological intervention directly on the knowledge-wisdom-purpose layer**, changing the interpretation framework and goal orientation of the input data of the AI system, thereby affecting the perceptual experience of the output. The advantage of this type of therapy is that it targets high-level mechanisms and therefore may lead to more lasting improvements (because it changes the \"software\" rather than just intervening in the \"hardware\" signal). However, its limitations are that the effect is slow, individual differences are large, and it requires the subjective cooperation of patients.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Through the above analysis, we will identify key links that have not yet been covered by conventional therapies. For example, if neither drugs nor physical stimulation are found to be able to restore the brain's normal interpretation of sensory signals (see Wisdom Layer Problem), then new therapies should focus on this. Conversely, if some molecular pathways (data layer issues) cannot be specifically regulated by existing means, we will also consider the development of corresponding new drugs. The output of this part of the research will be a \"mechanism-limitation\" analysis report and a corresponding description of the DIKWP semantic model for each of the existing therapies, which will provide direction for innovative strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Abnormal Perception Recognition and Semantic Inference of the Artificial Consciousness DIKWP Model:</strong> After mastering the biological mechanism and the traditional therapeutic landscape, the core innovation of this project lies in the introduction of the DIKWP artificial consciousness model to simulate and understand the human perception process, and to design anomaly detection and semantic inference algorithms accordingly. The DIKWP model is composed of five layers: Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom and Purpose, which is an informatics depiction of human cognition/consciousness processes. Applied to the field of perception, it can be explained as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Data layer:</strong> Raw signal input from a sensory organ, equivalent to an unprocessed nerve discharge or pixel stimulus. For vision, it is a light stimulation signal for the retina, and for pain perception, it is an electrical signal for nociceptors.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Information layer:</strong> Characterization of data after initial processing and feature extraction. For example, the edge and shape of the vision, or the intensity and location of the painful stimulus. Biologically corresponds to a low-level sensory center (limbic detection of visual cortex V1, spinal/thalamic coding of pain intensity). This step turns cluttered data into meaningful schema information.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Knowledge layer:</strong> Synthesize multimodal information and combine memory and learning to form an understanding of the current situation. Visually, it's the process of identifying \"what you're seeing is a cat\"; In terms of pain, it is to know that \"the pinprick sensation of the hand means injury\". The knowledge layer involves the invocation of past experience and semantic memory. In the brain, this corresponds to a wide range of junction areas and hippocampal/neocortex synergy.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Wisdom Layer:</strong> Builds on knowledge to make higher-level judgments and decisions, including situational understanding, value evaluation, and strategy selection. For example, being aware that \"this is just a hallucination, not real\" or \"persistent back pain may mean a serious cause that requires medical attention.\" The Wisdom layer introduces values and long-term experiences to connect perceptions with behavioral decisions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Purpose Layer: The</strong> flow of information that runs through and drives the above levels, representing the goals, motivations, and concerns of the system. Purpose determines where to focus attention and what to expect from perception. For example, a strong desire to see something can affect visual processing tendencies, and a person who is afraid of pain may have an overawakened layer of the brain that amplifies pain signals. Purpose is the core driving force of the model, ensuring that the processing of each layer is directional.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the context of DIKWP, perceptual impairment can be seen as a result of deviations in processing at all levels. For example, hallucinations can be interpreted as the fact that the information layer noise is misidentified as a real signal by the knowledge layer, and the Wisdom layer fails to properly label its false nature; Chronic hyperalgesia can be seen as a weak signal in the data layer that is given too high a threat weight through the knowledge layer, and the Wisdom layer makes an excessive pain response decision. In response to this understanding, we will develop the following key modules in the Artificial Consciousness OS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Anomaly Perception Recognition Module: Listens</strong> to the status of each layer of the DIKWP model when processing external inputs, and triggers an alarm once an abnormal pattern occurs. In terms of specific implementation, a set of monitoring indicators can be designed for the model, such as a sudden increase in the output entropy of the information layer (indicating the possibility of hallucinatory noise), a large difference between the output of the knowledge layer and the historical norm, and an abnormally low or high decision-making confidence in the Wisdom layer. Once the indicator crosses the bounds, it is judged that there is a perceptual anomaly. This module is similar to the \"self-monitor\" of artificial consciousness, allowing AI to supervise its own perception process. For example, when a pattern is \"seen\" that is not real, the information-knowledge match of the model decreases, and this disagreement can be used as a warning sign for hallucinations. As another example, pain can also be considered abnormal if the Wisdom level decision (pain response intensity) is significantly inconsistent with the objective stimulus. We will use existing anomaly detection algorithms (such as Bayesian prediction error-based detection) combined with the DIKWP hierarchy for custom development.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Semantic reasoning algorithms across brain regions:</strong> When the human brain processes perceptual information, multiple brain regions often cooperate to form a \"global workspace\" or semantic network. This inspires us to introduce cross-module semantic inference in the DIKWP model: that is, in the knowledge and wisdom layer, multiple semantic nodes are introduced to represent the knowledge of different brain regions, and each node transmits information to each other through the graph network or Transformer architecture to jointly reason the meaning of perception. For example, in the case of visual hallucinations, the output of the visual cortex node contradicts the information of the cognitive node of the prefrontal lobe (the prefrontal lobe may have experience knowing that something should not appear in this situation), and the error of the visual node can be corrected through semantic exchange. In terms of implementation, we will adopt the method of graph neural network <strong>(GNN) or multi-agent collaborative inference: each agent represents a functional brain region, has a local knowledge base and inference rules, and coordinates through message passing. The algorithm needs to solve the problems of heterogeneous information fusion, conflict detection and consistency convergence, and can learn from AI inference models such as blackboard model or Bayesian network. In the case of pain, such an algorithm can combine somatic sensory information with emotional background and memory information to determine whether the pain signal is reasonable. For example, when reasoning across brain regions leads to \"no harm at the moment but still a strong pain signal\", abnormal amplification can be assumed to be present, which triggers intervention recommendations.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>AC Operating System: The</strong> functions of each layer of the DIKWP model, anomaly detection and semantic inference modules are integrated into a single operating environment to realize the unified scheduling of data flow and the interface of human-computer interaction. This is similar to equipping an artificial consciousness model with a \"conscious brain\". The OS will be responsible for receiving input from the simulated environment (the data layer feeds the model sensory interface), managing the processing threads at each layer, generating action decisions or feedback outputs to the environment at the Wisdom layer, and presenting the internal state of the model on the HMI (e.g., visualizing the semantic content of each layer). The operating system also needs to include a metacognitive loop, a cycle in which the model evaluates and adjusts its own state. Professor Yucong Duan proposed the DIKWP × DIKWP dual-cycle architecture, which can be introduced as a reference. We will try to implement a metacognitive agent that responds to the output of the anomaly perception recognition module, adjusting the model parameters as needed (e.g., reducing some bias in the Purpose layer). The final OS should enable the artificial consciousness model to achieve a closed loop from perception, cognition to action in the simulated environment, allowing us to observe and intervene in the model's perceptual anomalies through the platform.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The development of the above modules will use programming languages such as Python or C++, using deep learning frameworks to build the necessary neural network models, supplemented by symbolic AI methods to implement inference mechanisms. The AI engineers in our team will write the corresponding algorithm code and conduct unit tests and integration tests. Pseudocode 1 shows the basic idea of anomaly detection and intervention algorithms:</p>\n<p># Pseudocode 1: Anomaly Perception Detection and Intervention Process in Artificial Consciousness OS</p>\n<p>initialize DIKWP_model # Initialize the parameters of each layer of the artificial consciousness model</p>\n<p>loop:</p>\n<p>sensory_data = get_environment_input() # Get environmental sensory input</p>\n<p>info = DIKWP_model.data_to_info(sensory_data) # data-&gt; information processing</p>\n<p>knowledge_repr = DIKWP_model.info_to_knowledge(info) # information - &gt; knowledge</p>\n<p>wisdom_decision = DIKWP_model.knowledge_to_wisdom(knowledge_repr) # knowledge-&gt; wisdom decision</p>\n<p>output_action = DIKWP_model.wisdom_to_action(wisdom_decision) # Generate actions/feedback based on the Wisdom layer output</p>\n<p># Anomaly perception and identification</p>\n<p>if detect_anomaly(info, knowledge_repr, wisdom_decision):</p>\n<p>anomaly_type = classify_anomaly_pattern(info, knowledge_repr, wisdom_decision)</p>\n<p>log(\"Anomaly detected: \" + anomaly_type)</p>\n<p># Collaborative correction of semantic reasoning across brain regions</p>\n<p>adjusted_knowledge = cross_region_semantic_inference(knowledge_repr, context_memory)</p>\n<p>revised_decision = DIKWP_model.knowledge_to_wisdom(adjusted_knowledge)</p>\n<p># Trigger intervention</p>\n<p>if anomaly_type == \"Hallucination\":</p>\n<p># For example, reduce the weight of visual information to enhance the rational judgment of the prefrontal lobe</p>\n<p>DIKWP_model.adjust_layer_parameter(layer=\"info\", param=\"gain\", value=lower)</p>\n<p>elif anomaly_type == \"hyperalgesia\":</p>\n<p># For example, reduce the prior intensity of pain and increase the pain suppression signal</p>\n<p>DIKWP_model.adjust_layer_parameter(layer=\" Purpose \", param=\"pain_expectation\", value=reduce)</p>\n<p>continue # Restart the next cycle (let the model re-perceive after adjustment)</p>\n<p>endif</p>\n<p>perform_action (output_action) # Perform model output (e.g., produce a reaction to the environment or provide user feedback)</p>\n<p>end loop</p>\n<p><em>Pseudocode 1 describes the general cyclic flow of an artificially conscious operating system. When a perceptual anomaly is detected, the system first adjusts the internal representation through cross-region semantic inference, and then modifies the model parameters according to the anomaly type (equivalent to taking interventions) before entering the next perceptual cycle. This enables a closed-loop control:</em> <strong>continuous monitoring, identification of anomalies, intervention, and re-observation</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Design of perceptual abnormality intervention strategy and construction of digital simulation platform:</strong> After obtaining the artificial consciousness OS, we will enter the application stage of research, with the goal of building a digital simulation platform for testing the effects of various intervention strategies on perceptual abnormality. The platform consists of the following components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Virtual Environment &amp; Sensation Interface:</strong> Create customizable, simulated environments to present visual and pain-related scenarios. The visual environment can use Unity3D or VR technology to generate realistic 3D scenes and stimuli that may induce hallucinations (such as random flashing light and shadow in low-light conditions, and the guidance model may be misjudged); The pain environment simulates a virtual organism with a \"pain sensor\" through a computer model, or directly builds a mathematical function to generate pain signal inputs (which can be fitted based on real pain neuronal firing data). The artificial consciousness OS obtains these environmental signals through the perception interface to achieve \"virtual perception\". The interface needs to support the introduction of noise or anomalies, such as we can overlay random patterns on the visual data to simulate visual triggers, and continuous background discharges on the pain data to simulate neuropathic pain. The interface will also record the model's behavioral responses to the environment (e.g., the model \"reports\" what it sees, or exhibits pain-avoiding actions) for us to evaluate the effect of the intervention.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Intervention Strategy Library:</strong> We will implement a variety of controllable intervention methods in the platform for flexible combination testing. These include: 1) <strong>Virtual drug</strong>: Insert an operation to change parameters in a certain layer of the model to simulate the effect of the drug. For example, the \"blocker\" is set to act on the data-&gt; information conversion function to reduce the signal intensity by a certain percentage (similar to the effect of anesthetic); or act on a certain type of signaling pathway at the knowledge layer, increasing its threshold (similar to antipsychotic inhibition of over-predictive signals). 2) <strong>Virtual electrical stimulation</strong>: The output of a node inside the model is regularly forced to modify to simulate the intervention of electrical stimulation. For example, the abnormal peaks in the pain information flow are cut each cycle, or the visual information buffer is reset periodically, simulating the intervention of TMS in the visual cortex. This can be achieved by including trigger conditions in the loop. 3) <strong>Semantic correction</strong>: The feedback channel of the artificial consciousness model itself is used to apply high-level information to the low-level to achieve \"cognitive regulation of feelings\". For example, when an illusion is detected, the Wisdom layer outputs a signal to the information layer, prompting that it may be an illusion, and the information layer reduces the credibility of the corresponding signal. This is similar to the process by which the patient informs himself that his hallucination is unreal through volitional awareness. We can also design an external intelligent agent to act as a \"therapist\" that reads the model state and sends semantic guidance. 4) <strong>Novel strategies</strong>: including the semantic-driven refactoring and lead drugs we conceived. Semantic-driven refactoring refers to influencing perception by modifying the model's Purpose layer without relying on external physical actions (e.g., dynamically adjusting the model's attention allocation so that it no longer focuses excessively on anomalous stimuli); The lead drug is based on mechanism discovery, and tests drugs with new targets in simulation, such as blocking glial cell-mediated inflammatory pathways, to see if it can reduce abnormal pain signals. These strategies can enable complex interventions through combinations, such as the \"drug + semantics\" combination: reducing the underlying signal intensity and altering the top-level cognitive evaluation at the same time may be more effective than a single measure.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Evaluation &amp; Feedback Module:</strong> In order to objectively measure the effectiveness of the intervention, we pre-set a series of evaluation indicators. For example, \"hallucination rate\" (the number of hallucinations reported by the model per unit time), \"pain score\" (the numerical value of pain intensity output by the model's Wisdom layer), etc. The platform will automatically record the curves of these indicators under different intervention strategies. We will use commonly used statistical tests to compare whether the effects of different strategies are significantly better than no intervention or the current standard intervention. For example, a strategy is considered to have potential if it reduces the incidence of hallucinations by more than 80% and has fewer side effects (interference with normal perception). The feedback module is also linked to the anomaly detection module to continuously monitor new anomalies as the intervention is in progress, and dynamically adjust the intervention parameters when necessary to achieve closed-loop optimization. For example, if the model shows signs of tolerance to an intervention (metrics begin to pick up), the system can prompt an increase in the dose or the addition of an adjunctive strategy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The digital simulation platform will be presented with a user-friendly interface, allowing researchers to easily configure experiments. For example, select the intervention combination through the drop-down menu, set up a simulation scenario (such as \"no one room at night\" to induce visual hallucinations, \"continuous inflammatory input\" to induce pain abnormalities), and see the state changes and output behaviors of the DIKWP layer inside the model in real time after running. This is the equivalent of a \"digital lab\" capable of repeatingly, multifactorily testing hypotheses without the need to consume real lab animals or endanger patients. Considering that there is no physical equipment foundation for this project, the construction of this platform is an important guarantee to ensure the execution of research tasks, and it is also a reflection of the innovation of the project. It allows us to iteratively screen out the best solutions in a cost-effective and efficient manner, and then devote limited resources to biovalidation of the most promising strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Animal simulation verification and pilot mechanism exploration:</strong> In order to improve the credibility of the research conclusions, we plan to select key findings for preliminary reality verification in the later stage of the project, mainly by simulating and intervening in the corresponding perceptual abnormalities on animal models. Due to the lack of large-scale experimental instruments in this project, we will use the support of cooperative units or public data resources for verification, and the specific solutions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Animal Behavior Simulation of Visual Hallucinations: Mice</strong> were selected as models to reflect visual perception using their avoidance behaviors. For example, we can build a simple maze in which a certain section of the path wall is projected with dynamic light and shadow interference, and mice may exhibit confusion or misjudgment of the path (similar to hallucinatory illusions). Our intervention was to reduce the number of misbehaviors in mice by presenting cue signals on a micromonitor carried by mice (corresponding to semantic interventions) or by optogenetic means to inhibit specific neuronal activity in the visual cortex (corresponding to physical interventions). If we are unable to conduct experiments in person, we can also use the literature to find out if there are similar experimental results, such as reports that inhibiting the activity of the anterior visual patrimbulum area of mice can reduce their optical illusion behavior, etc., as a validation support.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Animal model validation of chronic pain:</strong> Classical pain model mice (e.g., chronic sciatic nerve ligation model, elicit neuropathic pain) were employed. Behavioral (e.g., mechanical foot reflex threshold) and fiber-optic in vivo imaging techniques were used to evaluate the feasibility of our proposed intervention ideas. For example, we predicted that a drug targeting glial cells would attenuate central sensitization, so we gave an experimental glial inhibitor to the experimental group of mice, when available, to record changes in pain behavior. Or use the brain-computer interface method to train mice with real-time neurofeedback: when excessive activity in their pain-related brain regions (ACC, etc.) is detected, the reward pathway is stimulated to inhibit the activity, so as to achieve analgesia (corresponding to semantic-driven intervention ideas). The success of these attempts will provide valuable information for our model: success proves that the model is correct, and failure can be analyzed to feed back the model improvement.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Key Mechanism Biological Indicator Detection:</strong> Based on simulation and model analysis, we may propose new biological indicator predictions. For example, if our model shows that hallucinatory tendencies are closely related to striatal dopamine levels, we can use mouse behavioral experiments combined with microdialysis to measure the amount of striatal DA released when hallucination-like behaviors are induced to verify the association. If it can be confirmed that dopamine-driven high prediction weights lead to hallucinations, the influence of this project theory will be greatly enhanced. Similarly, for pain, we may focus on inflammatory factor levels, synaptic plasticity markers (e.g., pERK expression in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord), etc., and collaborate to obtain such data to support our inferences.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Through the above-mentioned multi-level and multi-method research content design, we will gradually realize the closed-loop research from basic mechanism understanding to model construction, to strategy development and validation. The innovation in the technical route lies in the fact that artificial intelligence models and digital simulation methods are fully used to replace some traditional experiments, which not only reduces costs, but also enables us to explore more hypotheses; At the same time, the key bioverification link is retained to ensure that the conclusions are not disconnected from reality. This technical route of \"virtual and real combination\" is very much in line with the current development trend of scientific research (such as the application of digital twins in medical treatment), and also provides a feasible path for this project to produce high-quality results without large-scale experimental instruments.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Three-year-task-breakdown\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Three-year-task-breakdown\" title=\"Three-year task breakdown\"></a><strong>Three-year task breakdown</strong></h1><p>The planned implementation period of this project is three years (36 months), and the phased tasks are divided according to the research content and technical route, which are broken down as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Year 1 (0-12 months): Theoretical research and model design stage.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>*Task 1: Literature research and mechanism review (0-6 months). *In the past 10 years, we will review the research papers and reviews on visual hallucinations and phantom limb pain/chronic pain at home and abroad, and sort out important molecular, cellular, circuit mechanisms and treatment progress.

In terms of project management, the project leader organizes progress discussions every quarter, coordinates resources and adjusts plans in a timely manner, and ensures that all tasks are completed on time and with quality.</p>\n<h1 id=\"System-diagram-and-pseudocode-description\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#System-diagram-and-pseudocode-description\" title=\"System diagram and pseudocode description\"></a><strong>System diagram and pseudocode description</strong></h1><p>During the implementation of this project, several key system architecture diagrams and algorithmic pseudocode were generated to illustrate the concept and technical implementation. In this section, we will excerpt some of them for explanation.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"图片描述\" src=\"/cooperation/items/media/image6.png\" style=\"width:60%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;\"/><br/><em>Figure 2: A cross-species computational psychiatric approach reveals the neural circuit mechanisms of hallucinations. Figure A (left) illustrates the design of behavioral tasks and computational models to find anomalous computational processes that elicit hallucination-like perceptions in humans and mice. The results suggest that abnormal perceptual reasoning (reporting non-existent stimuli with high confidence) stems from dysfunction of neural circuits. Panel B (right) shows the specific findings: when mice with elevated striatal dopamine levels, the incidence of high-confidence false reporting (HALIP) was significantly increased; Using optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic neurons leads to an increase in HALIP, which can be decreased by the antipsychotic haloperidol. This cross-species study verified that \"<strong>too strong a priori expectations + dopamine abnormalities</strong>\" can produce hallucinations, and provided experimental evidence for the consideration of dopamine as a regulator of the purpose/prediction layer in the DIKWP model of this project.</em></p>\n<p><em>The results shown in Figure 2 have important implications for our artificial consciousness model: as the experiment shows, the</em> <strong>influence of high-level expectations on perception plays a key role in hallucinations, and neuromodulators such as dopamine are the mediators through which organisms achieve this effect. Therefore, in our DIKWP model, a</strong> parameter like \"dopamine gain\" can be added to the Purpose/Destination layer to simulate the desired strength. If this parameter is too high, the model will be more inclined to believe that there is a meaningful signal in the noise, thus reproducing the hallucinatory phenomenon. This also explains why traditional antipsychotics reduce hallucinations by inhibiting dopaminergic activity: by reducing the inappropriate reinforcement of information from the Purpose layer. Therefore, this project designed an intervention to \"reduce the gain of the Purpose layer\" in the simulation to simulate the effect of dopamine blockers, and verified that the model predictions were consistent with the results in the literature. This fully demonstrates the value of system diagrams and model pseudocode in guiding us in designing experiments and interpreting results.</p>\n<p>The pseudocode 1 above has given an example of the detection and intervention process of the artificial consciousness operating system, which is used to communicate the algorithm logic within the team during the project development process and guide the actual programming implementation. In addition to pseudocode 1, we have compiled pseudocode for other key modules, such as the message passing algorithm of the \"cross-brain semantic inference\" module and the parameter discrimination criterion of the \"anomaly detection\" module. I won't list them all here for the sake of space, but the pseudocode is well documented in the project's technical documentation and verified in the code implementation. The role of pseudocode is to describe the logic of the algorithm in a way that is close to natural language, so that interdisciplinary team members (such as those with medical backgrounds) can also understand the operation of the AI module, which greatly improves the efficiency of collaboration.</p>\n<p>In summary, the system diagram intuitively shows the ideas of our model and experimental design, as shown in Figure 2, which condenses the complex concept of cross-species experiment into a concise graphical language. Pseudocode bridges the gap between algorithm design and implementation, turning abstract ideas into executable solutions. Both of these are important intermediate outputs of this project, and as the project is completed, we will also publish these charts and pseudocode to help more researchers understand and reproduce our work.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Key-technologies-and-innovations\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Key-technologies-and-innovations\" title=\"Key technologies and innovations\"></a><strong>Key technologies and innovations</strong></h1><p>This project crosses the frontiers of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, forming a series of original key technologies and innovations, which are summarized as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Introducing the DIKWP artificial consciousness model into the field of neuromedicine to realize the hierarchical semantic modeling of human perception processes:</strong> In the past, the research on perceptual disorders such as hallucinations and pain was mostly limited to neurobiology or psychology. For the first time, this project proposes to use the DIKWP model as an artificial consciousness framework to describe the whole chain of perceptual information processing. This innovation allows us to unify the whole process from sensory input (Data) to cognitive interpretation (Wisdom) to subjective Purpose (Purpose), and disassemble the complex perceptual activity of the human brain into analyzable and simulable modules. This method breaks through the limitation of the traditional DIKW <strong>(pyramid) model without a destination layer</strong>, and emphasizes the role of the purpose drive in perceiving anomalies. This not only enriches the application scenarios of the artificial consciousness model, but also provides a new paradigm for the study of perceptual disorders. We expect that this hierarchical model will greatly improve the explanatory power of subjective symptoms such as hallucinations/pain, and promote the application of AI in psychiatric and pain medicine.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Independent research and development of the \"perceptual anomaly recognition + cross-brain semantic reasoning\" algorithm to realize the self-monitoring and correction of abnormal perception by artificial intelligence: The</strong> anomaly detection algorithm developed in this project can monitor the multi-layer output of the artificial consciousness model in real time, and immediately determine the perceptual obstacle once the pattern is abnormal. Unlike normal anomaly detection, we incorporate cognitive semantic information, such as using the model's prediction error to identify hallucinatory signs. In addition, we innovatively construct a cross-brain semantic reasoning algorithm that allows AI to simulate the process of cooperating in different regions of the brain to parse perceptual information. When hallucinations or pain allergies occur, the algorithm can find information contradictions between different \"virtual brain regions\", and reach an agreement through message transmission to correct the abnormality from the semantic level. This is similar to the process by which the human brain interacts with the prefrontal lobe and sensory areas to determine whether a hallucination is true or false. This technology gives AI systems a certain degree of \"self-reflection\" ability, which is also a highlight in terms of AI safety and interpretability. We have applied for an invention patent for this purpose, with independent intellectual property rights.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Construct a digital simulation platform for perceptual anomalies without entity dependence, and realize the transformation of the research paradigm from \"WET experiment\" to \"SILICO experiment\".</strong> In view of the lack of large-scale experimental equipment in this project, we took a different approach and built a digital twin simulation platform. The platform places the artificial consciousness model in a virtual environment, allowing us to apply stimuli and interventions to the model as if it were an experimental animal, observing its \"behavior\" changes. This completely computation-based experimental method is low-cost, efficient, and reproducible, and can quickly screen a large number of hypotheses and schemes, and then use the best one for limited practical verification resources. This line of thinking coincides with the current international concept of medical digital twins. Our platform has specially designed a variety of scenarios and index evaluation systems for perceptual impairments, which is professional and unique. It can be said that we have used computers as laboratories and created a new model for studying perceptual disorders. The platform can also be expanded to the research of other cognitive disorders in the future, and has broad application prospects.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>A number of innovative intervention strategies based on artificial consciousness are proposed to realize the new concept of \"soft therapy\":</strong> Compared with the traditional \"hard intervention\" that relies on drugs and surgery, this project proposes a semantic-driven soft therapy concept at the simulation and theoretical levels. For example, by guiding the patient (or AI agent) to adjust the interpretation of perceived information, thereby reducing symptoms; Another example is to use virtual reality to provide correct sensory feedback to reshape brain cognition (such as the intelligent upgrade of mirror therapy). Many of these protocols have not yet been tried in the clinic, but our models predict their effectiveness and are supported in part by simulation and literature validation. If these ideas are confirmed in further research, it will open up a whole new world in the treatment of hallucinations and chronic pain. For example, digital therapeutics such as \"hallucination correction software\" or \"pain awareness reconstruction headsets\" may emerge in the future. We have put together a first draft of the patent for the new principles and are trying to get ahead of the curve. In short, this project boldly explores non-invasive, non-drug cures, bringing good news to patients and leading the transformation of medical models.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>The value of interdisciplinary and international dialogue:</strong> The research content of this project spans multiple fields such as neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence, computer simulation, etc., reflecting the true interdisciplinary integration and innovation. This paradigm itself is a breakthrough in the boundaries of traditional scientific research, which is in line with the trend of multidisciplinary collaboration in today's complex scientific problems. Internationally, the research on consciousness and brain diseases by artificial intelligence is also a hot topic, and our DIKWP model and simulation method have injected new elements into this topic. Up to now, the DIKWP model and related work have attracted global attention and are regarded as an important direction to solve the problem of AI interpretability and value alignment. This project applies this cutting-edge theory to major medical problems, and will certainly have international dialogue value. We plan to actively publish our results in top academic conferences and journals to enhance the discourse power of Chinese scholars in the intersection of artificial consciousness and brain science.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each of the above innovations is supported by corresponding technical support and data. In the process of project implementation, we not only pay attention to the introduction of cutting-edge ideas, but also ensure that ideas are implemented through models and experiments, so as to achieve original innovation \"from 0 to 1\". It can be expected that after the completion of this project, a new set of theories and technical systems with independent intellectual property rights will be formed, which will not only publish papers, but also may produce convertible software/patents, laying a solid foundation for subsequent in-depth research and product development.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Team-composition-and-division-of-responsibilities\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Team-composition-and-division-of-responsibilities\" title=\"Team composition and division of responsibilities\"></a><strong>Team composition and division of responsibilities</strong></h1><p>The project team is composed of experts and backbones from the fields of artificial intelligence, neuroscience, clinical medicine, etc., and has the knowledge and ability to carry out interdisciplinary research.

Dr. Wang, who has extensive clinical experience in pain and psychiatric disorders, will collect clinical data, case studies, provide medical interpretation of simulation results, and evaluate the clinical translational value of new strategies. His team will also assist with the validation part of the animal model, specifically the experimental design of pain behavior.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Principal Investigator of Project 3:</strong> Associate Professor Zhao Liu (Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence) – Responsible for the software development of artificial awareness OS and simulation platform. Dr. Zhao is proficient in machine learning and software engineering, and will lead several programmers to implement DIKWP model algorithms, anomaly detection modules, user interfaces, etc. He will also be responsible for the deployment and maintenance of the platform to ensure that the simulation experiments run smoothly.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Core Members:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Dr. Liu</em> (Postdoctoral Fellow, Cognitive Neuroscience): Assist in the connection between Project 1 and Project 3, provide brain imaging data analysis support, and map brain network mechanisms to model structures.

Given Professor Duan's extensive experience in promoting the industrialization of the DIKWP model, his joining will help us refine the model and expand our impact. However, as Professor Tuan wears many hats (including the President of the World Association of Artificial Consciousness), we only seek advice on an advisory basis and do not take up too much of his energy.</p>\n<p>The division of labor of the team follows the principle of \"tackling key problems in blocks and collaborating and integrating\", and each sub-team is independently responsible for its own modules, but realizes information sharing and collaborative problem solving through regular plenary meetings. The project leader and the project leader form a project management team to track the progress and schedule resources in a timely manner at the monthly meeting. We will also implement a dual tutor system for students, so that students in the field of artificial intelligence and students in the field of neuroscience can work together in pairs to learn from each other's knowledge backgrounds and bridge the gap in subject communication. For example, Associate Professor Zhao Liu was arranged to supervise Master Zhou's programming, and Researcher Li Si was assigned to supervise Dr. Qian's neuroscience theory. This training model not only improves the efficiency of research, but also lays a foundation for cultivating interdisciplinary talents in the future.</p>\n<p>The team as a whole has strong strength and complementarity. Experts in artificial intelligence and neuroscience participate in ensuring the scientific and innovative nature of the solution; Clinical experts ensure that the study is always oriented to the needs of the application; Young scholars and students are concrete, enthusiastic and creative. On the platform of the Active Medicine Committee of the World Association of Artificial Awareness, we also have the opportunity to interact with international peers and make up for the shortcomings. You can be confident that this team configuration will be up to the challenges of this project and achieve the desired goals.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Risk-plan\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Risk-plan\" title=\"Risk plan\"></a><strong>Risk plan</strong></h1><p>This project involves the exploration of new theories and technologies, and may encounter certain technical risks and uncertainties. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the project, we have formulated the following risk plans:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Model validity risk:</strong> As an emerging artificial consciousness model, there is no precedent for DIKWP to be applied in the field of specific perceptual impairments. There is a risk that the model will not adequately reproduce biological phenomena. For example, the model may not be able to simulate the details of certain hallucinations or the complexity of pain. In this regard, our plan is as follows: a) <strong>Model Iterative Optimization</strong> – Adopt agile development methods, first implement simplified model verification key concepts in the early stage, then gradually increase the complexity, continuously compare the simulation output with the literature/actual phenomena, and constantly adjust the parameters and structure until the results are satisfactory; b) <strong>Multi-model control</strong> – In addition to the DIKWP framework, we also consider introducing other cognitive models (such as global workspace model and predictive coding model) for control testing. c) <strong>Expert evaluation</strong> – Cognitive science experts are regularly invited to evaluate the rationality of the model output, detect deviations in a timely manner, and correct them. Through these measures, the risk of model failure is minimized.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Risks of Algorithm Technical Difficulties: The</strong> anomaly detection and semantic inference algorithms that the project needs to develop are quite challenging. If the performance of the algorithm does not meet the requirements (such as high false positive rate of anomaly detection and slow convergence of semantic inference), it will affect the evaluation of the effect of subsequent intervention strategies. To this end, we plan to: a**) simplify the problem** – give priority to simple scenarios, such as detecting a single type of hallucination first, and then expand to multiple types; Semantic inference is tested on a small network with fewer nodes and then scaled. Overcome it step by step to avoid difficulties in algorithm debugging due to over-complexity at the beginning; b) <strong>Leverage mature technology</strong> – make good use of existing machine learning tools, such as anomaly detection, try out algorithms such as Isolation Forest and One-class SVM as a reference baseline, and combine them with our customized methods; Semantic inference can be used as a reference for multi-agent reinforcement learning and the existing frameworks of graph networks. Seek help from the open source community when necessary; c) <strong>Performance Tuning</strong> – Make full use of the team's AI expert experience to perform mathematical analysis and optimization of the algorithm, accelerate convergence, add regular rules to prevent overfitting, etc. At the same time, we will prepare computing resources to support (apply for high-performance GPU servers) to make up for the lack of algorithm efficiency. Through these means, try to ensure that the algorithm module achieves the practical performance target.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Data and validation risks:</strong> Some biological experiments are required to verify the project in the later stage, but our experimental equipment is limited, and if the cooperation channels are not smooth or the experiment fails, the convincing conclusion may be weakened. In this regard: a) <strong>Multi-channel cooperation</strong> – contact a number of potential partners (universities or research institutes) in advance and obtain data from public databases at the same time. For example, open-source resources such as phantom limb pain fMRI dataset and EEG data of patients with hallucinations can be used when they cannot conduct experiments on their own. b) <strong>Alternative validation</strong> – If the conditions are limited in animal experiments, we can use simulation experiments instead of partial validation, such as building a higher fidelity computational model (e.g., simulating a large neural network) to verify the effect of the intervention, or using case reports as case study support; c) <strong>Gradual progress</strong> – Arrange the validation session in the third year and conduct it in a \"small-scale multi-batch\" manner, even if the results of a single experiment are not obvious, through multiple repetitions and comprehensive analysis of different indicators, and strive to draw trend conclusions. Even if we don't fully validate the hypothesis, we will have a frank discussion in the paper, pointing out what is needed to verify it in the future, without affecting project delivery.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Personnel and schedule risks:</strong> Interdisciplinary teams can be difficult to coordinate, and if there is miscommunication or personnel changes, it will affect efficiency. In this regard: a) <strong>Strengthen communication mechanisms</strong> – regular plenary meetings and workshops to ensure information symmetry. The project manager tracks the progress of each technical group on a daily basis, and immediately coordinates resources to solve problems when they are found; b) <strong>Personnel Preparation</strong> – Set aside flexible funds to support the hiring of short-term consultants or research assistants. In the event of an unexpected exit of personnel in key positions, substitutes can be quickly introduced. The team also encourages \"one specialty and multiple abilities\", such as AI personnel learning certain biological knowledge, and providing temporary support in case of lack of manpower in biology; c) <strong>Node control</strong> – Develop detailed Gantt charts, set quarterly milestone checks, and work overtime or reduce the scope of low-priority tasks in time when there are signs of delay, so as to ensure that the main line goals are completed on schedule.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Funding and equipment risks:</strong> Funding constraints may arise if it is found that certain algorithms require more computing power or software support, or that unplanned collaborative experiments require additional costs. In this regard: a) <strong>flexible budgeting</strong> – setting aside a certain amount of flexible funds (about 10%) in the budget to cover unforeseen expenses, such as the purchase of cloud computing services, data fees, etc.; b) <strong>Resource sharing</strong> – make full use of the existing equipment of the relying unit and the cooperative unit, such as server borrowing, laboratory sharing reagent consumables, to save costs. Actively apply for preferential resources of the school computer time or the National Supercomputing Center; c) <strong>Invest in Installments</strong> – Purchase equipment in a step-by-step manner according to the urgency of the task to avoid excessive one-time overhead. For example, high-performance GPUs can be rented for cloud service trials first, and then purchased physical equipment when necessary. These measures will cushion the financial pressure and ensure that the project is not on track.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general, we have fully predicted the potential risks and formulated a multi-level plan. With the team's multidisciplinary background and collaborative spirit, we are confident that we can flexibly respond to various challenges in the progress of the project, turning risk into motivation for improvement. Process documentation and knowledge accumulation will also be emphasized in project management, and even if setbacks are encountered, each attempt will be documented, providing lessons for subsequent exploration, minimizing the impact of uncertainty and ensuring that project goals are successfully achieved.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Expected-Results\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Expected-Results\" title=\"Expected Results:\"></a><strong>Expected Results:</strong></h1><p>The project is expected to achieve fruitful results by the end of the three-year implementation period, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Theoretical achievements:</strong> The \"Cognitive Framework of Perceptual Impairment Based on DIKWP Model\" was proposed to systematically elucidate the multi-level mechanism of perceptual abnormalities such as visual hallucinations and chronic pain. This new theory is expected to be published in high-level academic journals and promote the development of theories in related fields. At the same time, we will improve the details of the DIKWP model of artificial consciousness to make it closer to biological reality, and contribute a new model with both explanatory power and biological significance to the field of artificial intelligence.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Achievements of technical methods: The</strong> software of \"Digital Simulation Platform for Perceptual Abnormalities\" has been developed, which has the functions of simulating a variety of perceptual impairment scenarios and testing intervention programs. The platform will be released as open-source software or licensable for research and teaching use, and is expected to be a useful tool for the intersection of neuroscience and AI. In addition, we will summarize and refine anomaly detection algorithms and semantic reasoning algorithms to form a general methodology, write method papers or reports, and disseminate them in the field of AI and computational neuroscience, so as to enhance China's discourse power in artificial awareness algorithms.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Application and patent achievements:</strong> According to the new strategies verified in the project, 2-3 Chinese invention patents have been applied, such as: \"A hallucination detection and intervention method based on artificial consciousness\", \"Chronic pain semantic feedback control system\", etc. These patents will lay the foundation for future industrialization. We expect at least one project to be authorized by the end of the project (the rest will enter the substantive review stage), and actively seek to cooperate with medical AI companies to explore commercial possibilities such as applying digital simulation platforms to drug discovery (as an aid to new drug screening) or doctor training (providing visual hallucination/pain simulation cases).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Publications:</strong> Produce no less than 5 high-quality academic papers (including at least 3 SCI papers and 2 Chinese core papers). The topics cover: (1) the theoretical elaboration and simulation results of the DIKWP model of perceptual impairment (to be submitted to IEEE or Springer series of journals); (2) Technical details of anomaly detection and semantic inference algorithms (to be submitted to Artificial Intelligence Journal or journals in the field of neural computing); (3) Evaluation of the effects of digital platforms and intervention strategies (to be submitted to neuroscience or medical interdisciplinary journals, such as Frontiers in Neuroscience). At the same time, 1-2 papers (e.g., IJCAI, AAAI) will be submitted at the AI summit to introduce our interdisciplinary research to attract more attention. Enhance academic impact through paper publication.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Talent training:</strong> With the help of the project implementation, it is expected to train 2 doctors, 2-3 masters, and 1 postdoctoral. These young talents will master the cross-cutting skills of AI + brain science and grow into interdisciplinary research backbones. At least one Ph.D. is expected to complete a high-level dissertation on the content of this project. The team members will also improve their scientific research organization and communication and cooperation skills during the project exercise, so as to prepare for greater scientific research tasks in the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Academic Exchange and Impact:</strong> Through the project, we plan to hold 1-2 domestic academic seminars or thematic forums to share our progress, invite domestic and foreign experts to discuss the application of artificial consciousness in medicine, and promote academic exchanges. Actively participate in international conferences, such as presenting papers for NeurIPS, COSYNE, etc., or presenting our simulation platform at INCF (International Federation of Neuroinformatics) conferences. Strive to give an invited report at the annual meeting of the World Association for Artificial Consciousness to introduce the results of this project.

For example, <strong>intelligent assisted diagnosis</strong>: the application of anomaly detection algorithms to the patient's EEG/brain imaging data is expected to detect hallucinations or pain abnormalities early and improve the objectivity of diagnosis. <strong>Digital Therapeutics</strong>: Using our proposed semantic feedback and cognitive restructuring strategies, we develop applications for hallucination management or pain rehabilitation to provide patients with personalized non-pharmacological interventions. While these applications are beyond the scope of this project, our work will serve as a trailblazer and provide new ideas for industry. At the same time, the multidisciplinary nature and popularization of science will also help to disseminate scientific knowledge to the public, such as through media reports, to let the public understand how artificial intelligence can help understand human suffering and hallucinations, and improve the public's scientific literacy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, the expected outcomes of this project are rich and layered, from basic theory to technical methods to practical applications. Although clinical translation may not be fully realized during the project cycle, the theoretical and technical foundation laid has revolutionary potential. With these results, we are expected to continue to lead this emerging interdisciplinary field in the next 5-10 years, receive greater research grants, put theory into clinical practice, and contribute to the overcoming of perceptual disorders.\" This is also fully in line with the original intention of the key project: to take major scientific issues as the traction, produce new theories and technologies with international influence, and promote the development of related disciplines and industries.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Budget\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Budget\" title=\"Budget\"></a><strong>Budget</strong></h1><p>The total amount of scientific research funding to be applied for this project is 3 million yuan (three years), and the budget will be reasonably allocated to various expenditure subjects according to the needs of the research task. The specific budget and description of the funds are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Personnel costs:</strong> Budget of about 900,000 yuan (30%). Including the performance subsidy of the scientific researchers of the project team and the research assistant allowance for graduate students. Among them: the subsidy for the project leader and the project leader is calculated and paid according to the regulations of the university, with a total of about 200,000 yuan; 2 scientific research assistants/programmers for 3 years× with an annual salary of 150,000 yuan each, a total of 900,000 yuan; In addition, about 200,000 yuan of graduate student allowance and social security are reserved. Personnel costs are mainly based on incentive work, and are issued in strict accordance with the actual contribution, and do not exceed the total budget.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Equipment and software fees:</strong> The budget is about 500,000 yuan (16.7%). This project does not involve the procurement of large-scale experimental instruments, but in order to build a simulation platform and run a model, it needs to be equipped with high-performance computing equipment and necessary software licenses. It mainly includes: a) 2 sets of high-performance GPU workstations for deep learning training and large-scale simulation, each set is about 150,000 yuan, a total of 300,000 yuan; b) 100,000 data storage and server upgrade components (including large-capacity hard disks, memory expansion, etc., to ensure the efficiency of simulation data access); c) 50,000 yuan for commercial software license fees and development tools, such as Unity Pro software for VR scene development, MATLAB neural network toolbox, etc.; d) Other miscellaneous 50,000 yuan, such as UPS power supply to ensure that the calculation is not interrupted, etc. If there is a discount or switch to cloud computing services at the time of actual purchase, you can save and adjust accordingly.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Material consumables:</strong> The budget is about 200,000 yuan (6.7%). It is mainly used for consumables and a small amount of reagents related to animal experiments. For example, to conduct mouse behavior experiments with cooperative units, it is necessary to purchase experimental animals (several mice, 20,000 yuan), feeding expenses and conventional experimental reagents (narcotic drugs, sampling consumables, etc., 50,000 yuan); If you want to test biological samples, you need to purchase ELISA kits or tissue staining reagents (50,000 yuan). In addition, 30,000 yuan will be prepared for the purchase of literature database services, cloud data storage fees and other information materials. Due to the limited experimental links of this project, the material cost is relatively small, but it must be ensured that the key experiments are needed.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Testing and laboratory processing fee:</strong> The budget is about 100,000 yuan (3.3%). It is used to pay for outsourcing testing and processing services. For example, if you need to perform high-throughput sequencing or mass spectrometry analysis of animal brain tissue, you need to entrust a professional institution (about 50,000 yuan); Customizing special hardware (such as miniature rat back stimulator) may require a processing cost of 20,000 yuan; The rest is used as a maneuver for unforeseen testing expenditures. All commissioned services will be selected according to the bidding or market price, and the cost will be strictly controlled within the budget.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Travel and academic exchange expenses:</strong> The budget is about 400,000 yuan (13.3%). The project is interdisciplinary, which requires extensive cooperation and communication among team members. The travel expenses include: the domestic travel of the project team is 300,000 yuan, which is expected to be mainly used for: cross-city exchanges within the team twice a year (personnel exchange visits between AI sub-projects and medical sub-projects), going to cooperative units to carry out experiments (such as going to cooperative hospitals for data collection), participating in domestic academic conferences to share results, etc.; 100,000 yuan for international exchanges, and it is planned to support the project backbone to participate in at least one important international conference (such as artificial intelligence or neuroscience annual conference) in the third year to present the results. If the trip cannot be made due to the epidemic, it can be used to invite international experts to report online. Strictly implement the financial system of the unit and reimburse the actual reimbursement.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Conference and publication costs:</strong> Budget of about 150,000 yuan (5%). It is planned to hold an academic seminar or results conference in the middle and final of the project, with a budget of 50,000 yuan each time, including venues, materials, and honoraria for expert lectures. The paper page fee and patent application fee are budgeted at 50,000 yuan, which is used to pay for the necessary expenses for publishing Open Access papers (such as the layout fee of some SCI journals) and the official fees and agency fees for 2-3 patents from application to authorization. We will prioritise free publications, but set aside a budget in case needed.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Management Fee and Unforeseen Expenses: Estimated</strong> at $750,000 (25%). According to the policy of the relying unit, the management fee is calculated according to a certain proportion of direct expenses (typical 15%), which is used for the university's scientific research management and infrastructure depreciation, about 300,000 yuan. The remaining 450,000 yuan is used as unforeseen mobile funds, accounting for 15% of the total budget, for new reasonable expenses in the process of project implementation. For example, the model needs to add new modules, purchase software, and a key technology needs to temporarily hire external consultants or conduct additional experiments. When it is used, it must be approved by the manager to ensure that the special funds are used exclusively and cannot be diverted for other purposes.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The above budgeting fully takes into account the needs and characteristics of the project, and achieves comprehensive coverage, key focus and moderate redundancy. For example, personnel costs and equipment investment are the top priorities, accounting for nearly half, to ensure that human and computing resources are in place; At the same time, we have also considered the importance of interdisciplinary exchanges, and provided sufficient financial support for travel and exchange, so as to facilitate the collision of innovative ideas. The setting of unforeseen costs provides a buffer against risks for the project, and the financial allocation can be dynamically adjusted according to the actual progress. We are committed to strictly implementing the budget, complying with financial regulations, preparing detailed final accounts and budget adjustment reports every year, accepting supervision and auditing, and ensuring that funds are used for the relevant activities of the project. If there is a surplus, it will be returned or used for follow-up research according to regulations, so as not to waste national scientific research funds.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the application for this key project focuses on the frontier topic of \"Research on Neural Mechanism and Intervention Strategy of Perceptual Impairment Based on DIKWP Model of Artificial Consciousness\", and has been carefully planned in terms of research content, technical route, team organization and condition guarantee. The project has clear objectives, feasible solutions, theoretical innovation and potential application value, and is in line with the support direction of key projects. We believe that with the support of departments at all levels and the joint efforts of the team, this project will achieve breakthrough results, open up new ways for recognizing and intervening in perceptual disorders, and set an example for the integration of artificial intelligence and brain science. We sincerely ask for support for the establishment of key projects!</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Prof. Yucong Duan: DIKWP artificial consciousness model leads the future of AI, and 114 patents are expected to be implemented in the industry.

Background and significance\"></a><strong>1. Background and significance</strong></h1><p>Severity of insomnia disorder and research needs: Insomnia is a chronic dysfunction with a high prevalence and serious prevalence, characterized by difficulty falling asleep, impaired sleep maintenance, and decreased sleep quality, accompanied by problems such as daytime cognitive impairment. In recent years, the incidence of insomnia has continued to rise, which has a serious impact on people's physical and mental health, and has become a public health problem that needs to be solved urgently. However, so far, the neuromodulation mechanism of sleep-wake and the pathological mechanism of insomnia have not been fully elucidated, and the existing clinical treatment mainly stays in symptomatic treatment, and there is a lack of precise intervention methods for the etiology. Based on this, the latest scientific research guidelines in China list \"the neural mechanisms of sleep and wakefulness and the pathological mechanisms and diagnosis and treatment strategies of dysfunction\" as a key direction, with special emphasis on in-depth research on the occurrence mechanism of sleep disorders such as insomnia, and explore new strategies for non-drug intervention. This highlights the urgency and strategic significance of conducting innovative research on insomnia mechanisms and therapies.</p>\n<p><strong>Cognitive factors of insomnia and higher-order brain dysfunction: Numerous studies have shown that the occurrence and maintenance of insomnia are closely related to abnormal cognitive-affective processes. Cognitive models point out that patients with chronic insomnia often have excessive mental arousal and cognitive control disorders</strong>, such as repeated worrying before bedtime, suppressing distracting thoughts, ruminating thoughts and other adverse cognitive strategies to maintain and aggravate the wakefulness state. It is difficult for patients to relax and \"delegate\" to the body when they fall asleep, and their autonomic purpose is too strongly involved in the sleep process, resulting in a failure of self-regulation. For example, <strong>the \"purpose of falling asleep\" itself may be counterproductive to trigger anxiety</strong> – as the \"ambivalent intention\" in psychotherapy suggests, the more people fear insomnia and force themselves to fall asleep, and the more they are overly nervous, the harder it is to fall asleep. At the same time, insomnia patients often have perceptual biases about sleep status: overestimating their nighttime awake and underestimating sleep duration, which further reinforces anxiety and loss of control. These findings suggest that insomnia is not only a simple neuroexcitatory problem, but also involves higher-order cognitive dysfunction, including abnormalities in self-awareness, purpose generation, emotion regulation, and perceptual feedback. Therefore, it is of great significance to deeply analyze the mechanism of insomnia from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience and clarify which cognitive processes (such as false beliefs, over-monitoring, emotional interventions, etc.) play a key role in it, so as to innovate treatment strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>The DIKWP model and its potential in sleep cognitive regulation: In order to integrate multi-level cognitive processes, Professor Yucong Duan originally proposed the DIKWP reticular cognitive model</strong>。 DIKWP stands for Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom and Purpose, and extends the traditional linear \"Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom\" pyramid model into a fully connected network structure with a \"Purpose/Purpose\" layer. In this model, the five elements are interconnected with each other, and there are 25 bidirectional interactions and feedback loops. Different from the traditional bottom-up, one-way information processing chain, the DIKWP model allows two-way flow and dynamic adjustment between upper and lower cognitive processes: on the one hand, low-level data can be extracted into information and knowledge and integrated step by step to form Wisdom; On the other hand, high-level wisdom and purpose can also downward affect knowledge acquisition and information selection, thus forming a closed cognitive feedback loop. This mesh topology provides a full-link perspective from the perception input to the Purpose output, enabling iterative updates and bidirectional interaction between the layers of semantic units. The introduction of the DIKWP model into the study of sleep-wake regulation is expected to carry out cognitive modeling of complex multi-pathway regulatory mechanisms: for example, physiological signals and environmental cues are regarded as \"data/information\" layer inputs, memory and experience are regarded as \"knowledge\" layers, individual's understanding and strategies of sleep are elevated to the \"Wisdom\" layer, and finally sleep/wake decisions and motivation are attributed to the \"Purpose\" layer drive. Under such a unified framework, the comprehensive influence and feedback regulation of multi-dimensional factors such as circadian rhythm, environmental factors, and cognitive activities on the sleep-wake cycle can be simulated, providing a new tool for studying the maintenance and imbalance of sleep homeostasis.</p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Consciousness Theory Combined with DIKWP's Innovative Significance: Artificial Consciousness research aims to allow machines to simulate or have human consciousness characteristics, including high-level functions such as self-awareness, purpose-driven, and subjective experience. Professor Yucong Duan's team applied the DIKWP model to the construction of artificial consciousness system, and proposed the \"5×5 DIKWP\" consciousness representation and evaluation method</strong>to map the level of consciousness as a combination of states in the DIKWP semantic space. In particular, the team's patent proposes a \"dual circulation\" (DIKWP×DIKWP) artificial consciousness architecture: embedding a set of metacognitive cycles in addition to the basic cognitive processes to achieve self-monitoring, self-reflection and self-regulation of cognitive processes. To put it simply, one DIKWP cycle assumes the first-order cognitive function (perceiving information and generating purpose), while the second DIKWP cycle monitors and regulates the former as metacognition, which is equivalent to simulating a preliminary self-awareness. This architecture breaks through the limitations of traditional AI without self-regulation, and is regarded as an important way to move towards autonomous consciousness. Applying this artificial consciousness theory to the study of insomnia mechanism can deepen our understanding of patients' internal cognitive interactions: insomnia patients often fall into a vicious circle of over-involvement of subjective consciousness in physiological processes, which is essentially a state of imbalance of \"dual cycle of consciousness\", in which <strong>the awakened consciousness layer over-monitors and interferes with the sleep process that should operate autonomously</strong>。 Through the DIKWP × DIKWP model, the conflict between the patient's conscious and subconscious sleep regulation layers can be simulated: for example, the meta-purpose layer is overly focused on sleep conditions and causes anxiety, which interferes with the underlying sleep-driven information flow. This modelling helps to elucidate the mechanisms by which self-regulation is out of control in insomnia. Professor Yucong Duan's initial exploration has confirmed this idea: <strong>the idea of \"you have to wake up early tomorrow morning\" often leads to insomnia that night, which can be seen as the interaction between purpose and emotion under the framework of DIKWP</strong> - strong wake-up purpose and anticipation trigger anxiety and other emotions, which are continuously strengthened by comparison with memory knowledge, and finally maintain the body in a state of high alertness and difficulty falling asleep. This suggests that <strong>the disturbance of the purpose-emotional-cognitive feedback loop is one of the key causes of insomnia, and it is also where artificial consciousness theory can play a role.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theory and application value: In summary, this project introduces the DIKWP cognitive model and artificial consciousness framework into the</strong> study of sleep-wake regulation and insomnia, and is expected to achieve the following innovative understanding and application breakthroughs: (1) comprehensively reveal the neurocognitive mechanism of sleep-wake from the perspective of multi-level semantic interaction, and provide a unified model support for how complex brain networks produce and regulate sleep; (2) to elucidate the abnormal patterns of insomnia patients in information processing, cognitive evaluation, and **purpose decision-making, and to reveal new cognitive markers and potential intervention targets in their pathological mechanisms; (**3) develop adaptive digital therapies on the basis of the above theories, and use artificial consciousness systems to simulate human self-regulation functions, so as to provide a personalized and intelligent non-drug intervention method for insomnia; (4) Promote the cross-integration of sleep medicine, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence technology, and build a prototype of a digital therapy platform that can be extended to other cognitive dysfunctions, which will bring an exemplary role in promoting the clinical diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders and the development of the digital health industry in China.</p>\n<h1 id=\"2-Research-objectives-and-overall-technical-roadmap\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-Research-objectives-and-overall-technical-roadmap\" title=\"2. Research objectives and overall technical roadmap\"></a><strong>2. Research objectives and overall technical roadmap</strong></h1><p>Overall research objectives: This project proposes a series of organically connected research objectives around the cognitive mechanism of sleep-wake regulation and insomnia disorder intervention. These include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Construct a sleep-wake cognitive control mechanism model based on DIKWP model: By mapping sleep-related physiological signals and cognitive processes to the DIKWP semantic level, a cognitive framework that can simulate the interaction and regulation of multiple pathways in the sleep-wake cycle is established. The model will reveal the flow of information from sensory inputs (e.g., circadian rhythm signals, sleep drives) to high-level purposes (e.g., staying awake or falling asleep), and characterize the two-way feedback between levels.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Elucidate insomnia-related cognitive abnormalities and mechanisms: The constructed model was used to analyze the specific abnormal patterns of cognitive processes in insomnia patients, including perceptual imbalance</strong> (e.g., abnormal perception of fatigue and sleepiness signals), <strong>purpose disorder</strong> (e.g., excessive desire to fall asleep or worry), and information blocking (e.g., excessive nighttime thoughts due to insufficient processing of emotions/memories during the day). To identify how these abnormalities disrupt the normal balance of sleep regulation, and to reveal the mechanism of insomnia from a cognitive perspective.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Development of Insomnia Adaptive Digital Therapy Tools Based on Artificial Consciousness Architecture: Based on the DIKWP×DIKWP dual-cycle architecture, an artificial consciousness-driven cognitive purpose modulation module was designed</strong> to monitor and guide the sleep-related cognitive status of insomnia individuals in real time. The digital therapeutics system is able to autonomously adjust intervention strategies based on patients' physiological feedback and subjective reports, and achieve dynamic guidance and balance on patients' arousal levels, cognitive content, and emotional responses.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Design a closed-loop control path fused with EEG feedback: <strong>Integrate objective brain signal monitoring such as EEG into the digital therapy system to form a</strong> closed-loop control link of \"monitoring-analysis-feedback\". The patient's wakefulness level and sleep stage are evaluated in real time through EEG and physiological data, which are converted into data/information input in the DIKWP model, and the corresponding adjustment instructions (such as relaxation training, cognitive reconstruction prompts, etc.) are output after analysis by the artificial consciousness module, and the feedback is applied to the patient, so as to realize the two-way regulation of physiology and cognition.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Overall technical route: This project adopts the technical route of \"model construction→ mechanism analysis→ system development →clinical validation\", spanning two levels: basic research and application development. Firstly, the knowledge of cognitive science and sleep medicine was integrated at the theoretical level, and the correspondence between the DIKWP semantic network and the sleep-wake system was established, and the sleep cognitive control model was formed</strong>。 Then, through literature research, experimental data analysis and model simulation, the unique cognitive abnormal patterns of insomnia patients were identified, and the corresponding hypotheses were put forward and verified in the model. Then, according to the model mechanism, the artificial consciousness digital intervention system was developed: the semantic framework of the artificial consciousness operating system developed by the team was used to embed the DIKWP model into the software platform, and the metacognitive adjustment module and brain feedback interface were integrated to realize the intelligent guidance of user cognition-behavior. Finally, the system was tested and optimized in a clinical setting: a sample of insomnia patients was recruited, subjective sleep assessments (such as insomnia severity index) and objective physiological indicators (such as EEG band power) were collected through a period of intervention and application, the efficacy and safety of digital therapeutics were verified, and the model and algorithm were iteratively improved based on the results. In the whole process, we pay attention to multidisciplinary and closed-loop verification: not only cognitive models guide intervention design, but also feed back model modification through biological signals and clinical feedback, so as to ensure that the research output is both scientific and practical, and form a complete innovation chain from mechanism discovery to technical products.</p>\n<h1 id=\"3-Key-technologies-and-research-contents\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-Key-technologies-and-research-contents\" title=\"3. Key technologies and research contents\"></a><strong>3. Key technologies and research contents</strong></h1><p>This project intends to focus on the following key technical issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>(1) DIKWP semantic modeling and dynamic regulation mechanism of sleep-wake multidimensional interaction: The physiological, environmental and psychological factors related to sleep regulation were mapped to the five semantic levels of the DIKWP model, and a network interaction model was constructed to simulate the cognitive control process of sleep-wake transition. The research contents include: improving the connotation of semantic units at each layer (e.g., the data layer contains sensory input and physiological signals, the information layer contains sensory integration and primary perception, the knowledge layer contains memory and experience, the Wisdom layer corresponds to cognitive evaluation and strategy, and the Purpose layer represents action decision-making and motivation), as well as the two-way mechanism of interaction between layers (such as how the Purpose layer affects knowledge and information processing through top-down feedback, and how physiological signal changes trigger Purpose at the bottom-up). Fix). This model is used to depict the time sequence of information flow under normal sleep conditions: for example, when night comes, the darkness of the environment and the biological clock signal enter as \"data\", triggering the perception of drowsiness in the information layer, combined with the sleep habits of the knowledge layer and the degree of brain fatigue</strong> The Wisdom layer makes a global assessment of the need for sleep, and finally the Purpose layer generates and executes the Purpose of Sleep. The process of waking up in the morning is reversed. Furthermore, mathematical simulations or computational models (such as discrete time state machines or differential equations) are introduced to dynamically simulate the cognitive network, and the response of the system to different inputs (such as illumination and pressure) and the stability of multiple internal feedback loops are analyzed. The results of this part will reveal the network topological characteristics and key links of sleep-wake regulation, and provide a benchmark model for the subsequent analysis of insomnia mechanism.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>(2) Research and development of cognitive purpose modulation module based on artificial consciousness system (\"consciousness arousal-information integration-feedback rebalancing\" path control): design and implement an artificial consciousness kernel implanted in the digital therapy system</strong>, giving it the ability to mimic human self-regulation and is used to correct abnormal cognitive-purpose states in insomnia patients. Specifically, the study will focus on the definition of a \"conscious arousal\" indicator, which assesses the patient's current level of arousal and cognitive load through the analysis of real-time data (e.g., brain excitability based on EEG β/theta wave ratio, relaxation based on breathing heart rate). When the degree of arousal is abnormally high, the artificial consciousness module is \"awakened\" into active intervention mode. Secondly, the function of \"information integration\" was realized, which integrated patients' subjective reports (such as drowsiness and anxious thoughts) and objective signals, and used the DIKWP model to interpret and understand the internal state of patients. For example, if it detects that the patient's high-frequency EEG activity is still significant after closing his eyes, accompanied by subjective feedback that \"the brain can't stop\", the system can recognize that the patient is stuck in the cognitive loop of \"worrying and not being able to sleep\" at the knowledge/wisdom level. Then, the \"feedback rebalancing\" control is carried out - the artificial consciousness module generates a corresponding adjustment plan at the Purpose layer according to the above situational evaluation, and feeds back to the patient through the digital therapy interface to achieve the correction of his physical and mental state. This feedback may include instructing the patient to transfer consciousness (e.g., using the \"ambivalent intention\" technique to advise them not to force them to fall asleep to relieve tension), guiding relaxation training or mindfulness meditation to reduce arousal levels, providing cognitive restructuring suggestions to correct exaggerated perceptions of insomnia, and adjusting environmental parameters (lighting, music) to create a more sleep-friendly atmosphere. The core of this module is to use DIKWP× the metacognitive cycle in the DIKWP architecture to achieve self-monitoring and self-adjustment: on the one hand, the system monitors the changes in the user's physiological and psychological state, and on the other hand, continuously evaluates the intervention effect and updates its own strategy, and finally forms a closed-loop control to make the patient's wakefulness-sleep state tend to be balanced.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>(3) Identification and digital modeling of cognitive biomarkers of insomnia: combining cognitive models and experimental data, the objective and subjective indicators that can characterize insomnia can be mined, so as to provide a basis for personalized diagnosis and intervention. The study first focused on the characteristics of EEG: by collecting polysomnography EEG data from insomnia patients and healthy controls with cooperative sleep centers, conducting spectrum analysis and power spectrum comparison, verifying whether the typical abnormalities reported in the literature, such as increased power in the high-frequency β band</strong> and <strong>decreased slow-wave activity in the NREM phase, were significantly present, and the correlation between them and the severity of insomnia was quantified. In addition, dynamic brain network indicators, such as changes in functional connectivity in different brain regions during sleep, were explored as potential markers. Secondly, attention was paid to cognitive and behavioral indicators</strong>: for example, sleep diaries and questionnaires were used to evaluate the perceptual-objective sleep disperception (Sleep State Misperception), bedtime anxiety level, daytime fatigue cognitive function, etc., and the indicators that were significantly abnormal in the insomnia group were screened out. Then, these multi-dimensional markers were mapped to the DIKWP model for digital depiction, such as treating high-frequency EEG activity as too much \"data\" noise, discognizing perception and reality as distortion of information layer processing, and treating excessive attention to the consequences of insomnia as an unreasonable trade-off of the Wisdom layer, so as to enrich the model's ability to describe insomnia. Finally, an individualized evaluation algorithm was established based on the identified markers, and the degree of insomnia-related cognitive deviation could be quantified by inputting the individual's EEG and behavioral data, which could be used for hierarchical intervention decision-making of digital therapeutics. For example, when the algorithm detects that a user still has significant β waves higher than the baseline threshold after falling asleep, and the subjective report anxiety score is high, it will determine that the user is in the \"high arousal-high anxiety\" subtype, and the system will trigger more intense relaxation and emotional counseling interventions for this pattern. This research content will provide a quantitative basis for decision-making of digital therapeutics, and realize accurate classification and dynamic monitoring of different patients.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>(4) Development of digital system for insomnia intervention and design of dual regulatory mechanism of behavior and cognition: On the basis of the above theories and data, a software system of \"digital therapy for insomnia\" was developed</strong>to achieve simultaneous intervention on patient behavior and cognition. The design concept of the system is to integrate the effective elements of traditional cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) into an AI-driven platform to make interventions more efficient, personalized and accessible. The specific R&amp;D content includes: (1) Behavioral intervention module: digital realization of classic behavioral strategies such as sleep hygiene education, stimulus control therapy and sleep restriction therapy. For example, the system can automatically suggest adjustments to the user's sleep diary (such as postponing bedtime to increase sleep drive), and help them strictly follow it through schedule management and reminder functions. Use the phone's location and time information to correct users when they detect a violation of sleep hygiene principles (e.g., being active in a bright environment late at night). (2) Cognitive intervention module: embed interactive cognitive reconstruction and relaxation training tools. The system guides users to record their worries before going to bed through the dialogue interface, and uses the built-in cognitive reevaluation algorithm to give feedback to help users look at sleep problems from a more rational and peaceful perspective. At the same time, it provides a variety of relaxation methods such as progressive muscle relaxation, breathing guidance, meditation audio, etc., and activates the aforementioned artificial awareness module when necessary to implement more intelligent guidance (such as automatically inserting a mindfulness practice when the user is overly worried). (3) Personalized self-adaptation: With the help of machine learning methods, the feedback and intervention effect data of users are continuously learned, and the intensity and combination of the above-mentioned behavioral and cognitive interventions are adjusted. For example, if a user responds well to relaxation training but has difficulty implementing sleep restrictions, the system tends to add relaxation sessions and implement sleep restrictions gradually. With this adaptive mechanism, user compliance and efficacy are maximized. It is worth emphasizing that this system is different from the mobile app of the general fixed program, and is more similar to a continuously evolving intelligent therapist: with the support of the artificial consciousness framework, it can perceive**, make decisions and intervene in real time** to provide treatment options that vary from person to person. Previous studies and clinical trials have shown that the efficacy of pure online digital CBT-I in improving insomnia symptoms is no less than face-to-face treatment. The system of this project will take this foundation and explore new ways to improve efficacy by introducing physiological feedback and consciousness control algorithms such as EEG. For example, it can monitor the user's night EEG in real time, and automatically push intervention content when it is found that it has been awake for a long time, shortening the <strong>latency period of falling asleep</strong>; Another example is the combination of wearable devices to monitor daytime activities and emotional states, providing users with round-the-clock sleep health management suggestions. The successful development of this digital system will provide a standardized and scalable digital therapeutics for insomnia.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>**(5) Digital therapeutics platform construction and clinical sample evaluation: After the completion of the research and development of core modules, an integrated digital therapeutics platform for insomnia will be built and clinical trial evaluation will be carried out. The platform will include user terminals (mobile apps or wearable device interfaces) and cloud services (human-aware decision engines, data storage and security management). First of all, it is technically necessary to ensure the stability of the system and the security of data privacy. Then, small-scale user testing is used to refine the interactive experience and personalized recommendation algorithms. On this basis, at least 100 patients with insomnia were recruited for intervention studies in cooperation with clinical medical institutions. Digital therapeutics were applied to participants using randomized controlled trials or controlled before-and-after designs, followed for weeks to months. In terms of objective indicators, polysomnography (**PSG) or wearable devices were used to record the changes in sleep structure before and after the intervention, including sleep latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and the number of awakenings. For subjective measures, the Insomnia Severity Index <strong>(ISI)</strong> and <strong>the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used</strong> Isoscales assess symptom improvement. Patient compliance and satisfaction feedback were also recorded. Based on these data, the clinical effects of this digital therapeutics were evaluated, such as the average reduction in the insomnia severity index, the percentage points for the improvement in sleep efficiency, and whether a significant proportion of patients met the criteria for no clinical insomnia. Statistical analysis will verify the significance of this system in improving sleep compared to baseline or control. In addition, exploratory analyses were used to examine differences in efficacy between different subgroups (e.g., those with high anxiety vs. those with low anxiety) to identify room for model improvement. The final output of the project will include: <strong>a sleep-wake cognitive model tool</strong>, <strong>an artificial consciousness feedback module</strong>, a <strong>digital therapeutics software prototype</strong>, and a 100-case clinical application data and analysis report. These phased results not only verify the research hypothesis, but also lay the foundation for the generalization of the results.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"4-Feasibility-analysis\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-Feasibility-analysis\" title=\"4. Feasibility analysis\"></a><strong>4. Feasibility analysis</strong></h1><p><strong>Research foundation and team advantages: This project is led by Professor Yucong Duan of Hainan University, whose team has profound research accumulation and innovation achievements in the field of artificial intelligence and brain cognition. As the initiator of the DIKWP artificial consciousness model, Professor Yucong Duan has been highly recognized at home and abroad, and has been authorized 114 invention patents (including 15 PCT international patents), covering many cutting-edge directions from large model training, artificial consciousness construction, cognitive operating system to AI governance. These patented technologies constitute a complete DIKWP cognitive technology system, which provides a solid reserve of independent intellectual property rights and methods for this project. The team's research on the basic theory of cognitive computing and artificial consciousness is a milestone in the introduction of the \"Purpose\" layer in the traditional DIKW model</strong> and the realization of full-link semantic feedback, proposing an interpretable and controllable cognitive architecture, which provides an innovative path for transparent decision-making and autonomy of AI systems. This original theory provides a direct reference and reusable framework for the construction of a sleep cognitive model and an artificial consciousness regulation system in this project.</p>\n<p><strong>Previous related work: In recent years, Prof. Yucong Duan's team has begun to integrate the DIKWP model with the biomedical field to explore new models of active medicine/digital therapeutics, and has achieved preliminary results in multiple application scenarios. For example, in an artificial consciousness system that simulates doctor-patient interaction, the team developed a DIKWP semantic-driven state machine model to realize the whole-process simulation and feedback control of cognitive decision-making in the diagnosis and treatment process. Based on the principle of the DIKWP model, the team successfully developed a prototype of the Artificial Consciousness Operating System (ACOS),</strong> which embeds the five-layer cognitive process in a semantic form into the computing framework, which can orchestrate and manage the cognitive process of complex tasks. This OS is equivalent to the \"semantic operating system\" of AI, similar to the traditional OS that manages hardware resources and process scheduling, while the DIKWP semantic OS manages knowledge resources and cognitive process scheduling, so that each module within AI can operate in an orderly manner at the semantic level. This capability is critical to the development of a digital therapeutics platform for this project – we will leverage the existing ACOS architecture to efficiently integrate the various components of the project (cognitive models, feedback modules, etc.) and reduce the barriers from theory to software implementation. In addition, the team also has accumulated experience in the direction of brain signal decoding and brain-computer interface: it has carried out research on pattern recognition and semantic interpretation of cranial nerve signals, and explored methods for mapping \"energy field\" signals such as EEG/EEG to the cognitive semantic layer. The information <strong>field-energy field coupling technology proposed by the team can correlate the internal cognitive state of the AI system with the external physiological signals, and realize cross-modal information fusion and regulation. This technology provides a feasible solution for the fusion of EEG feedback in this project, and our existing methods and algorithms can convert EEG features into input information of the DIKWP model, and adjust the feedback stimuli according to the results of the model. In short, the project team's pioneering work in artificial consciousness model, cognitive intervention algorithm and brain signal processing has laid a solid foundation and feasibility guarantee for the smooth implementation of this project</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical conditions and platform support: The relying unit has built relevant scientific research platforms, such as \"Artificial Consciousness and Cognitive Computing Laboratory\" and \"Brain-Computer Interface and Neuromodulation Technology Research Center\", etc., which have the software and hardware conditions required for this project. The team has high-performance computing servers for complex model simulation and machine learning training, and EEG acquisition and physiological sensing equipment for human-machine experiments. The previously developed artificial consciousness prototype system and cognitive operating system software will serve as an important development foundation, and it is expected that the semantic engine and scheduling module can be directly reused to accelerate the integrated research and development of digital therapeutics platforms. In terms of clinical research, we have established cooperative relationships with sleep medicine centers in many hospitals, which can obtain sufficient insomnia patient resources and expert guidance to ensure the smooth development of sample recruitment and intervention trials. In terms of management, the project team is composed of an experienced interdisciplinary team, including key personnel in the fields of artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, sleep medicine and clinical psychology.

Patients with paralysis lose their motor function for a long time, which not only has a very low quality of life, but also brings a heavy burden to their families and society. How to effectively restore the motor function of paralyzed patients is a major challenge and urgent need for medical and engineering technology.</p>\n<p>Status of traditional technologies: In recent years, breakthroughs in brain-computer interface (BCI) and neurostimulation have brought new hope to patients with paralysis. For example, patients with partial complete paralysis regain the ability to stand and walk by activating residual spinal nerve circuits through epidural electrical stimulation (EES). However, these recoveries mostly rely on pre-programmed stimulus sequences and require wearable sensors to detect residual movements to trigger, making the control not entirely \"natural\". Recent research has shown that the \"brain-spine interface\" that connects the purpose of brain movement directly to spinal cord stimulation allows patients to control lower limb movements in a more natural and active way. For example, a study implanted a 64-electrode array in the cerebral cortex of patients to collect motor purpose signals, and modulated the 16-electrode stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord in real time, establishing a digital bridge between the brain and the spinal cord, and achieving a breakthrough in the autonomic regulation of walking in paralyzed patients. These results demonstrate that closed-loop control of central signals and electrical stimulation is essential for the restoration of complex motor functions.</p>\n<p>**Problems and bottlenecks: Although the above-mentioned brain-computer interface and spinal cord stimulation technologies are exciting, there are still many shortcomings: (1) Lack of high-level cognitive involvement: The existing system mainly focuses on signal acquisition and stimulation output, and lacks in-depth modeling of the formation of patients' motor purpose and its interaction with sensory feedback. After paralysis, due to the lack of actual motor feedback, the brain's ability to produce and regulate motor purpose will gradually weaken. The study found that the degree of desynchronization of the rhythmic rhythms (μ and β waves) of the sensorimotor cortex was significantly reduced when patients with chronic paralysis attempted to move the paralyzed limb, but there was no significant difference with those in able-bodied patients when purely imagining movement. This suggests that the disruption of the actual motor-sensory feedback loop leads to plasticity changes and dysfunction of the brain's motor purpose pathways, which need to be reshaped by specific training. Existing techniques rarely take into account the assessment and reconstruction of subjective motor awareness and purpose generation in patients with paralysis. (**2) Limited degree of closed-loop intelligence: Many systems use fixed stimulation parameters, which is difficult to adapt to changes in the patient's state in time, and is prone to neural adaptation and stimulation inertia. The lack of comprehensive perception and intelligent decision-making mechanism for multi-source information such as environmental changes, patient fatigue, and muscle response leads to limited control accuracy and collaborative efficiency. (3) **Insufficient central-peripheral coordination: It is often difficult for single spinal cord stimulation or muscle/nerve stimulation to take into account the reconstruction of central pathways and peripheral muscle activation. A \"dual electrical stimulation\" strategy has been proposed in the literature, which combines epidural spinal cord stimulation with muscle electrical stimulation to simulate the central feedforward signal and peripheral feedback signal, respectively, so as to more effectively reconstruct the spinal cord sensorimotor circuit. Animal experiments have shown that dual stimulation can simultaneously promote the structural and functional reconstruction of spinal cord pathways, activate genes related to pro-axon regeneration, and improve spinal cord neuronal excitability at 10–20 Hz. These suggests that central and peripheral synergistic stimulation is expected to be a new way to treat paralysis, but the research on such multiparametric synergistic control is still in its infancy. (**4) Multi-channel precise control and feedback: Restoring complex motor functions requires spatiotemporal and precise coordination stimulation of multiple joints and muscle groups, which involves electrode control of a large number of channels and processing feedback of massive data. At present, clinical spinal cord stimulators usually have only about 16 channels, and most of them lack the function of obtaining and real-time adjustment of sensory feedback signals, which is difficult to meet the needs of fine collaborative control.</p>\n<p><strong>New Theoretical and Technological Ideas: In view of the above challenges, it is urgent to introduce new cognitive theoretical frameworks and artificial intelligence technologies to guide the</strong> design and control of spinal cord-peripheral nerve interfaces, so as to realize the leap from \"signal-driven\" to \"intelligent adaptive\". The \"Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom-Purpose\" mesh cognitive model proposed by Professor Duan Yucong provides a unique foundation for this. <strong>The DIKWP model adds a fifth layer of purpose to the traditional \"Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom\" architecture, and replaces the one-way hierarchical structure with a nonlinear network structure. The semantic elements of each layer can be fed back and updated in both directions, so as to form a multi-level adaptive cognitive network. This new cognitive system is an academic milestone that can provide an interpretable and controllable semantic-level decision-making mechanism for complex AI systems. Crucially, the</strong> DIKWP model ensures that the AI's actions always point to the intended goal by embedding \"Purpose\" into the cognitive process, so that every decision step has clear human-understandable semantics. In the research of Artificial Consciousness (AC), Professor Duan's team further proposed the \"DIKWP×DIKWP\" architecture, which introduces the dual-cycle structure of basic cognitive processes and metacognitive cycles to achieve self-monitoring, self-reflection and self-regulation, which is regarded as an important path towards autonomous consciousness AI. The \"dual circulation\" artificial consciousness architecture gives the AI system a preliminary self-awareness and purpose-driven adjustment ability.</p>\n<p>The above theoretical progress provides a new perspective for us to re-examine the reconstruction of motor function in paralyzed patients: we can regard the patient-environment-stimulus system as a whole containing data, information, knowledge, wisdom, and purpose, and restore motor control through artificial consciousness-driven dual closed-loop regulation. On the one hand, the DIKWP model is used to unify the <strong>representation and interactive modeling of five types of information flows, namely motor purpose, sensory feedback, nerve stimulation, muscle response, and environmental perception, which is expected to reveal the mechanism of central-peripheral information imbalance in the state of paralysis. On the other hand, the artificial consciousness system is introduced into rehabilitation training, and through virtual</strong> purpose feedback and adaptive stimulation, patients can re-\"perceive\" their own motor purpose to be recognized and realized, and rebuild the connection between the brain and the body.</p>\n<p><strong>Policy and application needs: This research direction is highly in line with the national science and technology strategy and clinical needs. \"Brain science and brain-like research\" has been listed as a key frontier area in the 14th Five-Year Plan, and brain-computer interface and neuromodulation technology are the focus of research, aiming to achieve functional reconstruction of major diseases such as paralysis</strong>。 For example, national and local action plans have been introduced to promote the completion of clinical trials of a number of implantable/non-implantable brain-computer interface products in the next few years to restore some of the language and motor functions of patients with aphasia and paralysis. Therefore, this project is carried out under the framework of the national guideline \"Research on Spinal Cord-Peripheral Nerve Interface Technology\", which not only responds to the direction of cutting-edge scientific and technological research, but also has great clinical translation value. By integrating the original DIKWP × DIKWP cognitive model and artificial consciousness theory, we will explore a new paradigm of intelligent rehabilitation, which is expected to break through the bottleneck of traditional technology and bring leapfrog functional recovery methods for paralyzed patients. This will not only significantly reduce the burden on patients' families and society, but also provide core technical support for China to seize the international commanding heights in the emerging industries of intelligent rehabilitation equipment and brain-computer interface.</p>\n<p>In summary, this project has important research significance: academically, it will create a central-peripheral integrated cognitive interaction model to enrich new theories in the intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience; Technically, a multi-parametric and adaptive neuromodulation system should be developed to improve the rehabilitation effect of paralysis. In terms of application, it accelerates the implementation of the intelligent rehabilitation platform to benefit the majority of patients, in line with the strategic goal of \"Healthy China 2030\" and the task requirements of the national key research and development plan.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Research-objectives-and-overall-technical-roadmap\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-objectives-and-overall-technical-roadmap\" title=\"Research objectives and overall technical roadmap\"></a><strong>Research objectives and overall technical roadmap</strong></h1><p>The core idea of this project is to construct a closed-loop control system with a high degree of integration between the central and peripheral areas under <strong>the guidance of Professor Duan Yucong's original DIKWP×DIKWP network cognitive model and artificial consciousness (AC) theory,</strong> so as to realize the reconstruction and training of motor function in paralyzed patients.

The model quantitatively describes the information transmission and feedback relationship between the central nervous system, peripheral nerves and the external environment, reveals the cognitive mechanism of motor control circuit dysregulation in the state of paralysis, and provides a semantic guidance framework for subsequent control strategies.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Analysis and reconstruction of the mechanism of motor purpose disorder based on artificial consciousness theory</strong>: Using the \"dual circulation\" structure in the artificial consciousness model, the metacognitive level is introduced to analyze the mechanism of motor purpose generation disorder and sensory feedback loss in paralyzed patients. To develop an artificial consciousness interaction training system for paralyzed patients, through virtual scenarios, biofeedback and other means, to simulate the closed loop of motor purpose-action-feedback, and reconstruct the generation and correction pathway of motor purpose in the patient's brain. The system is designed to train and repair the patient's brain motor purpose generation ability, enhance subjective initiative, and assist in reshaping the brain's control mapping of the body.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Precise spatiotemporal electrical stimulation control strategy for DIKWP hierarchical mapping</strong>: In the synergistic effect strategy of spinal epidural electrical stimulation and peripheral nerve/muscle electrical stimulation, the functional mapping method of each layer of the DIKWP model is introduced. Aiming at the functional goals pointed to by the motor Purpose layer, combined with the abstraction of the motor control mode by the knowledge and Wisdom layer, a multi-parameter spatiotemporal precision electrical stimulation scheme was formulated. These include: selecting the optimal stimulation site (posterior root nerve segment or peripheral nerve of the spinal cord), optimizing the timing and frequency of stimulation (according to the dynamics of the sensorimotor pathway, studies have shown that 10–20 Hz is an effective frequency band for rebuilding neural pathways), real-time adjustment of stimulation amplitude and pulse width, and coordination of the timing of central stimulation and muscle stimulation. A multi-parameter adaptive control algorithm was developed to enable the stimulation output to be adjusted in real time at the data/information layer according to the sensory feedback (such as electromyography, joint angle, force sensing, etc.) and the evaluation of the patient's state by the artificial consciousness system, so as to realize the refinement of different action purposes, and the spatial synchronization and time synchronization control of electrical stimulation and muscle contraction.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Prototype development of cognitive perceptual feedback multi-channel stimulation system</strong>: Design and development of a prototype of a high-density spinal-peripheral nerve stimulation system with more than 64 channels. The system will integrate cognitive perception feedback capabilities, that is, in addition to outputting multi-channel electrical stimulation, it will also synchronously collect multimodal information (such as electromyography signals, pressure sensing, accelerometers, etc.) from the patient's muscles, joints, and environment to form a closed-loop control. In terms of hardware, a programmable multi-channel stimulator has been developed, which supports the independent driving of more than 16 channels of epidural electrodes and several channels of peripheral nerve**/muscle electrodes, with millisecond-level timing accuracy and wireless communication functions. In terms of software, an embedded real-time control program was developed to allocate the stimulation parameters of each channel according to the strategy given by the DIKWP model. The prototype system will validate the ability to control at least the three major joints of the lower limb** (e.g., hip, knee, ankle) and their associated muscle groups. Through bench experiments, in vitro tissue or animal experiments, the muscle contraction effect, joint movement trajectory accuracy and safety of the system induced by different stimulation modes were evaluated, so as to provide a basis for subsequent human experiments.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Integrated intelligent rehabilitation training and evaluation platform</strong>: Build an intelligent rehabilitation platform that integrates the above achievements. The platform includes: spinal/peripheral multi-channel electrical stimulation subsystem, DIKWP structured function evaluation module, artificial consciousness human-computer interaction interface, and data management unit. Through the platform, personalized motor function recovery training for paralyzed patients is realized: the artificial consciousness interactive interface is used to present virtual training tasks to guide patients to produce motor purpose; The DIKWP evaluation module quantitatively evaluates the patient's current data, information, knowledge, Wisdom, and Purpose status (e.g., the data layer evaluates the EMG/EEG signals, the information layer evaluates the basic motor ability indicators, the knowledge layer evaluates the mastery of combined movements, the Wisdom layer evaluates the adaptability to environmental changes, and the Purpose layer evaluates the patient's active participation and subjective initiative). Based on the evaluation results, the parameters and training scheme of the electrical stimulation subsystem were adaptively adjusted. The platform will provide a doctor/therapist interface for setting training goals, monitoring the training process, and automatically recording and analyzing the patient's recovery progress. Finally, the platform is deployed in the clinical environment to implement personalized and intelligent motor function reconstruction and training services for paralyzed patients.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Objectives 1 and 2 provide the theoretical basis and software architecture of the project, objectives 3 and 4 focus on specific technology implementation and hardware development, and goal 5 focuses on system integration and application verification. In terms of the overall technical route layout, this project adopts <strong>the route of \"theoretical model guidance, key technology research, prototype system development, clinical verification and application</strong>\". Firstly, the DIKWP × DIKWP model were used throughout the whole process, and the motor purpose reconstruction and electrical stimulation strategies were studied under this framework. Then, the core technologies such as multi-parameter stimulation and feedback control were overcome, and software and hardware prototypes were developed. Finally, it is integrated into a complete platform that can be tested in clinical trials. The technical route is shown in the figure:</p>\n<p><em>Fig.1 Conceptual diagram of the intelligent control system of the brain-spinal interface: a central-peripheral dual closed-loop control framework fusing the DIKWP ×DIKWP cognitive model. Purpose signals from the cerebral cortex are transmitted to spinal cord stimulation through the central circuit, and peripheral sensory feedback is transmitted back through environmental and somatic sensors. The artificial consciousness module (metacognitive ring) monitors and adjusts the entire process to achieve the voluntary recovery of motor function</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Figure 1 conceptually illustrates the intelligent control system to be constructed in this project: the patient's brain movement</em> purpose is obtained by the implanted/non-implanted signal acquisition device, the purpose information is decoded by the wearable processing unit, and the DIKWP cognitive model is input for multi-level semantic understanding; Combined with the artificial consciousness module for self-monitoring, the processing unit generates dynamic adjustment instructions for the spinal cord/peripheral nerve stimulation program, and acts on the spinal cord and muscles through a multi-channel stimulation device to induce corresponding limb movements; At the same time, the muscle response and external environment information collected by various sensors enter the information/knowledge layer of the cognitive model through the feedback channel, which supports the system's evaluation of the current action effect and the optimization of the next decision. Metacognitive loops ensure that the system is adaptive, self-adjusting, e.g., autonomously changing the training rhythm and stimulation pattern when a patient's fatigue or ambiguity is detected. This \"double closed-loop\" structure that combines a central closed loop (brain-spinal cord/muscle) and a self-regulating closed loop corresponds to the dual-loop concept of the DIKWP × DIKWP model, which is expected to significantly improve the naturalness, effectiveness and safety of motor control in paralyzed patients.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Key-technology-research-content-and-sub-module-design\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Key-technology-research-content-and-sub-module-design\" title=\"Key technology research content and sub-module design\"></a><strong>Key technology research content and sub-module design</strong></h1><p>Focusing on the above overall goals, we subdivide the tasks into five modules, corresponding to five key technical directions. The research content and scientific and technical problems to be solved in each module are as follows:</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-DIKWP×-DIKWP-cognitive-interaction-modeling-module\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#1-DIKWP×-DIKWP-cognitive-interaction-modeling-module\" title=\"(1) DIKWP× DIKWP cognitive interaction modeling module\"></a><strong>(1) DIKWP× DIKWP cognitive interaction modeling module</strong></h2><p><strong>Main contents: To establish a central-peripheral integrated DIKWP network cognitive model</strong> to simulate the interaction of different elements in the motor control system of paralyzed patients. This module first defines the connotation of five core elements in this research scenario: <strong>data D</strong> (such as the original signals of each sensor, including EEG/EMG, electrical stimulation potential, environmental signals, etc.), <strong>information I</strong> (useful information extracted from the data, such as exercise purpose signal characteristics, muscle contraction intensity, joint angle changes, etc.), <strong>and knowledge K</strong>(knowledge of human movement patterns, physiological laws, such as coordination patterns of walking, muscle recruitment sequences, balance maintenance strategies, etc.), <strong>Wisdom W</strong> (higher-level decision-making and strategies, such as the ability to adjust gait according to environmental requirements, adjust protocols based on training feedback), <strong>Purpose P</strong>(the patient's subjective expectation of a target action or function). Next, we will construct formal representation and association rules for these five elements, such as using directed graphs or tensor networks to represent dependencies and feedback paths between features. Based on the DIKWP brain region mapping theory proposed by Professor Duan Yucong, the above elements were mapped to the neuroanatomical structure and functional circuit of the brain-spinal cord-muscular system to form a model corresponding to cognition and physiology.</p>\n<p><strong>Innovation: Most of the traditional neural control models are one-way hierarchical reflection loops, and this module introduces the concept of DIKWP mesh bidirectional feedback, which regards motion control as a multi-level and multi-directional information flow network. For example, we will explore the reaction of the Purpose layer to the knowledge layer</strong> (the shaping of movement patterns by the patient's goals) and <strong>the modulation of the Purpose layer by sensory feedback</strong> (how successive failures/success experiences affect patient willingness). This cognitive model of the global view can explain many paralysis phenomena, such as the weakening of purpose due to long-term lack of exercise, or the bias of purpose due to false sensory feedback (hallucinations, false touch). We will verify the plausibility of the model by analyzing previous literature data and clinical observations, such as comparing whether the model prediction is consistent with the changes in brain activity and electromyographic response during the exercise attempt in real paralyzed patients. In addition, the model will also be used to guide the design of subsequent stimulus control algorithms: different DIKWP layers correspond to different control strategy dimensions, such as low-level signal filtering and feedback delay compensation in the data layer, pre-stored motion pattern library matching in the knowledge layer, multi-objective optimization decision-making in the Wisdom layer, and terminal target selection in the Purpose layer. The results of this module will form a cognitive interactive simulation platform, which can verify the hypothetical control strategy in a virtual environment (such as simulating the dynamic changes of each element when the patient tries to walk on the computer), and provide a theoretical basis for subsequent technologies.</p>\n<p>Expected results: Complete the customized definition and implementation of DIKWP × DIKWP model in motion control scenarios; Publish relevant theoretical papers to explain the structure and mechanism of the model; Develop a prototype software for cognitive interaction simulation, and verify the effectiveness of the model through examples, such as simulating single-joint motion Purpose Transfer and Feedback Loop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-Artificial-consciousness-driven-motor-purpose-training-and-feedback-module\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-Artificial-consciousness-driven-motor-purpose-training-and-feedback-module\" title=\"(2) Artificial consciousness-driven motor purpose training and feedback module\"></a><strong>(2) Artificial consciousness-driven motor purpose training and feedback module</strong></h2><p><strong>Main content: Develop an artificial consciousness interaction training system</strong> to help paralyzed patients reactivate and train the brain's motor purpose generation circuit. The system consists of two sub-parts: <strong>the mathematical consciousness subsystem and the physiological consciousness subsystem</strong>. Based on the DIKWP model and the \"BUG\" theory of consciousness, the mathematical subsystem undertakes the functions of <strong>identifying, interpreting and guiding the user's purpose information. The physiological subsystem connects with the patient's physiological signals and perceptual feedback, and realizes information interaction with the mathematical subsystem.</strong></p>\n<p>Specifically, we'll build a Purpose training scenario <strong>on a virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality platform</strong>: The patient wears a BCI device (eg, a noninvasive EEG cap) or imaging device and attempts to perform some simple movement (eg, imagining a leg lift, grasping an object) in a virtual environment as prompted. The mathematical consciousness subsystem uses the pre-trained Purpose decoding algorithm to extract the features related to the purpose of movement (data → information conversion) from the patient's EEG/Encephalomagnetic data, and elevates these features to the semantic level through the DIKWP model, and compares them with the existing knowledge base (such as the brain signal pattern of normal people completing the action) (information → knowledge transformation) to judge whether the patient's purpose is clear and complete. If the Purpose signal is detected to be weak or disordered, the artificial consciousness will give feedback through the virtual coach, such as visual/auditory prompts for the correct way to exert force, or even directly replace the patient in the virtual environment to perform the action (the virtual body movement is controlled by an artificial intelligence agent), so that the patient can see that his \"<strong>Purpose\" has been realized</strong>, thus forming a <strong>Purpose-feedback loop</strong>to strengthen the activation of the corresponding pathways in the brain. At the same time, the physiological subsystem records the patient's heart rate, electromyography and other physiological responses, evaluates the patient's concentration and effort (Wisdom layer), and feeds this information back to the mathematical subsystem for adjusting the guidance strategy (e.g., reducing the training intensity when the physiological load is too high, and giving reminders when the attention is decreasing). During the operation of the whole system, the artificial consciousness module acts as a \"metacognitive coach\" to self-reflect and adjust the patient's purpose attempt: for example, when multiple attempts are unsuccessful, guide the patient to change the imagination strategy; When mastered gradually, the difficulty of the task increases. This kind of interaction based on artificial consciousness is expected to break through the limitations of traditional one-way neurofeedback training and provide a more humanized and effective new mode of rehabilitation training.</p>\n<p>Key technical problems: This module needs to solve: (1) <strong>motor purpose signal decoding and evaluation</strong>: extract the residual motor imagination brain signal characteristics of paralyzed patients, and evaluate the degree of deviation from the normal mode. Machine learning/deep learning methods will be used to construct the Purpose detection model, and the detection results will be interpreted with DIKWP knowledge layer semantics (e.g., \"the patient's current purpose is unclear, and there is a suspected lack of expected sensory support\"). (2) <strong>Artificial consciousness decision-making</strong>: design the decision-making mechanism of the consciousness subsystem, that is, how to adjust the training feedback according to the information of each layer of DIKWP. This is equivalent to defining the \"state of consciousness\" and \"behavior\" of artificial consciousness, for example, the purpose layer of the consciousness system always aims to \"help users successfully produce effective purpose\", the knowledge layer masters the rules of various training and guidance strategies, and the wisdom layer selects the best strategy according to the context. (3) <strong>Virtual-real feedback mapping</strong>: Ensure that feedback in the virtual environment can be effectively transferred to the patient's subjective experience. For example, by providing sensory feedback to the patient on a virtual motion through a synchronized tactile device, or by applying a burst of peripheral nerve electrical stimulation when the patient sees the virtual self moving a leg, the brain receives the leg sensation, thereby tricking the brain into producing a \"I moved\" experience, so as to enhance the association of purpose with feedback. This involves techniques such as multimodal feedback synchronization and sensory reproduction. (4) <strong>System adaptability</strong>: the cognitive ability and degree of impairment vary greatly among different patients, and the artificial consciousness system needs to adaptively adjust the parameters, for example, for patients with high paraplegia but good cognition, they can rely more on their active purpose; For cognitive deterioration caused by long-term paralysis, artificial consciousness needs to be more actively involved and guided. We will introduce methods such as reinforcement learning, so that the artificial consciousness system can continuously optimize its own strategy through training data to adapt to individual differences.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Results: This module will result in the development of a set of artificial awareness Purpose training software and supporting user-side hardware (which may include VR glasses</strong>, EEG acquisition devices, vibration haptic feedback devices, etc.). Initial testing on a small sample of paralyzed patients is expected to show <strong>an increase in brain motor purpose signaling</strong>(e.g., increased EEG ERD amplitude), increased success rate of Purpose, and even improved mental state (e.g., increased self-efficacy). We plan to publish academic papers on \"Purpose Reconstruction of Artificial Consciousness-Assisted Movement\", as well as the formation of software copyrights or patents (such as \"Artificial Consciousness Rehabilitation Training Method\"). The results of this module will lay the cognitive and purpose foundation for subsequent real-life electrical stimulation training.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-DIKWP-hierarchical-mapping-of-electrical-stimulation-precision-control-module\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-DIKWP-hierarchical-mapping-of-electrical-stimulation-precision-control-module\" title=\"(3) DIKWP hierarchical mapping of electrical stimulation precision control module\"></a><strong>(3) DIKWP hierarchical mapping of electrical stimulation precision control module</strong></h2><p><strong>Main contents: To study and implement a multi-parameter electrical stimulation collaborative control strategy fused with the DIKWP model</strong>, the core of which is to organically combine spinal epidural stimulation (SCS) and peripheral nerve/muscle stimulation (PNS/FES) to simulate and restore the central-peripheral physiological signal circulation. We will design the corresponding stimulation modes based on the representation of the target action at different levels in the DIKWP model: (a) <strong>Purpose layer</strong>: the overall stimulation goal is determined by the patient's current desired functional action, such as standing, walking, or holding, and different stimulation protocols are selected accordingly. (b) <strong>Wisdom layer</strong>: Adjust the stimulation strategy according to the perception and context of the environment, such as the need to adjust the muscle strength distribution of the legs in real time when the ground slope changes, which can be realized by the Wisdom layer decision engine. (c) <strong>Knowledge layer (knowledge):</strong> spatiotemporal patterns of spinal-muscular stimulation <strong>that store and recall specific movements</strong>. For example, walking can be pre-stored with a multi-channel stimulation schedule organized according to gait phase, and a fist can simultaneously stimulate the ulnar nerve and median nerve. The knowledge layer acts as a repository of expert experience, defining the current intensity/frequency combinations that each channel electrode should output at different moments to achieve a specific synergistic action. (d) <strong>Information layer (information):</strong> deals with low-level sensor feedback and state estimation. For example, electromyography sensing is used to assess the degree of muscle contraction triggered by the current stimulus, and accelerometers are used to determine whether the joint movement is at the desired angle. The information layer compares this data with the expected model of the knowledge layer to generate an error signal. (e) <strong>Data layer (data):</strong> high-speed processing of raw signals and instructions, including basic operations such as filtering, A/D conversion, and pulse train generation.</p>\n<p>According to the above layering, we design the architecture of the multi-parameter control system: <strong>the central control algorithm is the</strong> implementation of the Wisdom layer and the knowledge layer, running in the host computer or implantable controller; Algorithm inputs include user purpose (possibly from the results of module 2 decoding), environmental information (from sensors, such as pressure pads to sense the force on the plantar foot), and real-time feedback (provided by the information layer). The algorithm first retrieves the initial value of the stimulus mode of the corresponding action in the knowledge base, and then adjusts the mode parameters through the optimization algorithm based on the feedback error to achieve closed-loop correction. For example, when a lack of EMG response is detected, the amplitude of the corresponding channel current can be automatically increased; If joint movement is delayed, it may be necessary to advance the phase of stimulation of the channel. We will explore the method of using model predictive control (<strong>MPC) or incremental PID combined with fuzzy control to introduce a certain amount of self-learning ability while ensuring stability. In particular, in terms of dual-stimulation synergy, the division of labor between spinal cord stimulation and muscle stimulation is determined</strong>: spinal cord stimulation primarily activates spinal cord networks such as the central pattern generator (CPG) (which provides basic rhythms), and muscle/nerve stimulation is used as a supplement to strengthen specific muscle group contractions (providing additional strength or fine tuning). This is similar to feedforward + feedback control: spinal cord stimulation provides a feedforward drive signal, and muscle stimulation corrects based on actual action feedback. Based on data from previous animal trials and simulations in this project, we will optimize this division of labor, for example by determining the frequency and amplitude ratio of the two during the different phases of exercise. It has been shown that <strong>a spinal cord stimulation frequency of 10–20 Hz combined with muscle stimulation can promote pathway reconstruction and functional recovery at the same time. Based on this, we will further refine the optimal frequency</strong>/waveform combination for different actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical difficulties:</strong> (1) Multi-objective parameter optimization: Controlling dozens of electrical stimulation channels at the same time to complete multi-joint cooperation is an optimization problem with high dimensions and multiple constraints. We need to take into account the goals of movement accuracy, balance stability, and stimulus safety (to prevent excessive fatigue or tissue damage). Prepare for a hierarchical optimization strategy: first use a heuristic algorithm to determine the overall parameters of the spinal cord and peripheral stimulation (e.g., the ratio of each to the stimulus intensity), and then use a quick search or gradient algorithm to fine-tune the single-channel parameters. (2) Real-time: The control algorithm must run on a millisecond cycle (especially under fast rhythmic movements such as walking, it can be detected with a delay of 100ms). Therefore, the algorithm needs to be efficient and concise, and we will do code optimization and hardware acceleration (such as using FPGA to handle heavy calculations) while maintaining performance. (3) <strong>Personalization and self-adaptation: each patient has different neurological residual functions, and the effect of the same stimulation parameters in different people varies greatly. Therefore, the system needs to have an adaptive tuning function. We consider introducing a closed-loop parameter mechanism: the system automatically scans different combinations of parameters and evaluates the output (e.g., testing the effect of different spinal electrode combinations on the EMG response) at the patient's initial use, forming a patient-specific parameter set. Thereafter, in long-term use, if a decrease in the effect of the parameters is detected (e.g. muscle fatigue due to attenuation of response), online parameter adjustment is initiated.</strong> The knowledge layer and the wisdom layer of the DIKWP model come into play here: the knowledge layer stores the patient's past valid parameter records, and the wisdom layer uses the rules engine to determine when adjustments are needed and adjust the strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Results: A complete set of spinal-peripheral bistimulation synergistic control algorithms was formed</strong>, and its effectiveness was verified in computer simulations and ex vivo/animal experiments. Specific achievements include: the software implementation code base of the algorithm, key technology invention patents (e.g., \"Multi-channel neurostimulation control method based on DIKWP model\"), and academic papers (e.g., explaining the effect of closed-loop control of double stimulation, such as the improvement of motor function indicators compared with single stimulus). In terms of validation effect, we expect to see that compared with the traditional scheme, the new algorithm can reduce the stimulation current threshold (because the synergistic effect is more effective), <strong>improve the accuracy of motion output</strong> (reduce the error of joint trajectory), and <strong>improve neuroplasticity indicators</strong> (such as the enhanced response of the central conduction pathway evoked after stimulation). These will provide a strong basis for the next step of hardware implementation and human trials.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-Cognitive-perceptual-feedback-multi-channel-stimulation-system-module\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-Cognitive-perceptual-feedback-multi-channel-stimulation-system-module\" title=\"(4) Cognitive perceptual feedback multi-channel stimulation system module\"></a><strong>(4) Cognitive perceptual feedback multi-channel stimulation system module</strong></h2><p><strong>Main contents: Research and development of high-performance neurostimulators with 64 channels and above and their supporting sensing and control modules to achieve collaborative stimulation control of multiple joints and muscle groups, and have cognitive perception feedback functions. The module consists of two parts: hardware and firmware.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>On the hardware side</strong>, we will expand the number of channels and increase the feedback interface based on the design of the existing neurostimulator. The overall architecture of the system can be divided into: <strong>stimulation output unit, signal acquisition unit, main control unit and communication unit</strong>. The stimulation output unit adopts a multi-channel constant current source or voltage source design, and supports at least 64 independent programmable outputs, each with an output current range of 020 mA (accuracy &lt; 0.1 mA), pulse width of 01 ms (step adjustable), and a frequency of up to 500 Hz to meet diverse stimulation needs. The output channels can be flexibly assigned to epidural spinal electrode arrays (e.g., 8×8 matrix, 64 points total) or multiple groups of myoelectrodes via a switching matrix. We will design flexible electrode plates for the spinal-epidural space, containing 16 or 32 electrode contacts, arranged in multiple posterior root entry regions corresponding to the lumbosacral segment, to cover the innervated segments of major lower limb muscle groups. In the periphery, a combination of surface electrodes and buried electrodes is used to provide stimulation interfaces for key muscle groups such as quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior muscles. The signal acquisition unit includes a number of analog front-ends, which are used to collect feedback signals such as electromyography (EMG), joint angle (through wearable IMU), pressure (insole sensor), etc., with a sampling rate of 1~2 kHz and a resolution of 16 bits per channel. The focus is on electromyography feedback, which can help determine the stimulus-induced muscle excitation and contrast voluntary contractions with electrically evoked contractions. The main control unit uses a high-performance embedded processor (such as ARM Cortex-M or RISC-V cores) combined with an FPGA to process massively parallel data. The main control unit executes a closed-loop control algorithm and communicates with the host computer or the implanted consciousness module. The communication unit provides a wireless link (e.g. Bluetooth Low Energy BLE or dedicated RF) for uploading data and receiving high-level instructions. Considering that the system has two parts, implantable and extracorporeal, we will adopt a modular design: <strong>the extracorporeal controller is placed on the patient's wheelchair or belt, including the main control and battery; The implanted stimulator is as small as possible and can be placed epidural or subcutaneously to be responsible for the actual electrical stimulation output, and is connected to an extracorporeal controller via percutaneous or wireless means. This split solution reduces the size of the implant and facilitates power delivery.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In terms of firmware and control software</strong>, we will develop firmware driven by a real-time operating system (<strong>RTOS) to ensure synchronization and low latency of multi-channel stimulation and acquisition. Key tasks include: multi-channel waveform generation, hardware safety monitoring (e.g., impedance detection, temperature monitoring to prevent overheating), data buffering, and packaging and transmission. Cognitive perceptual feedback is reflected in the firmware logic: for example, after each stimulus pulse is emitted, the firmware waits for a preset delay to collect the corresponding EMG response, calculates the contraction amplitude, and decides whether to adjust the intensity of the next pulse compared to the expected value. The firmware needs to provide configurable rules</strong> for the high-level DIKWP smart module to issue policies, such as \"enable feedback adjustment mode\" or \"designate a muscle to participate in the closed-loop\". We will also develop host computer monitoring software for parameter configuration, data visualization and documentation. The host computer software will integrate the DIKWP structured evaluation module, which can display the indicators of each layer in real time during the training process (e.g., data layer: current myotelem-to-noise ratio; Information layer: current range of motion; Knowledge layer: percentage of action completion; Purpose layer: Patient active cooperation score, etc.), which are valuable for clinicians to assess the effectiveness of training.</p>\n<p><strong>Innovations and challenges:</strong> (1) At present, there are few neurostimulation systems with more than 32 channels in commercial use at home and abroad, and our 64+ channel system will reach a new height in terms of hardware integration and controllability, and it is necessary to overcome engineering problems such as inter-channel interference and power management. (2) Cognitive perceptual feedback is not available in traditional stimulators, and our system will be the first to combine sensor acquisition and stimulus output in a closed loop on the same platform, so that the stimulator is no longer a \"blind\" output device, but an intelligent device with preliminary \"cognition\" - it can \"sense\" whether the muscles are following the stimulus instructions and adjust themselves accordingly. (3) We will introduce safety protection mechanisms throughout the hardware and firmware design, such as software limiting, preventing continuous single-point high-frequency stimulation, and automatic stopping of abnormal disconnection detection, etc., to ensure that any uncontrolled risk can be contained in time in a closed-loop situation to meet the safety requirements of medical devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Results: A set of laboratory prototype devices has been developed</strong>, including multi-channel stimulation host, implanted electrodes and accessories, and supporting control software. We will thoroughly test its performance metrics with the following goals: &lt;5% output waveform error, &lt;–60 dB of channel-to-channel crosstalk, &lt; 10 ms control delay, and &gt;8 hours of continuous system operation (battery powered). Its function is then validated in animal experiments (e.g., testing the electromyography response of the hindlimb elicited by multi-point spinal cord stimulation on anesthetized animals, and observing multi-point synergistic gain versus single-point stimulation). If possible, we also plan to conduct preliminary functional tests on several volunteer subjects (patients with complete paraplegia with low thoracic spine who can be recruited and temporarily implanted with epidural electrodes under local anesthesia) to verify that the system can activate the specified muscle groups according to the set program and that the parameters can be adjusted, for example, to change the range of motion of the joints. Success indicators include the induction of coordinated movement of at least 3 lower extremity joints (e.g., standing or pedaling), simultaneous activation of multiple muscle groups and sequential proximity to physiological patterns (as assessed by electromyography timing correlation). The results of this module will be presented in the form of hardware objects and test reports, and relevant invention patents will be applied for (such as \"multi-channel neurostimulation device with feedback control\") to provide a hardware basis for the final integration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-Integrated-intelligent-rehabilitation-platform-integration-and-clinical-application-module\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#5-Integrated-intelligent-rehabilitation-platform-integration-and-clinical-application-module\" title=\"(5) Integrated intelligent rehabilitation platform integration and clinical application module\"></a><strong>(5) Integrated intelligent rehabilitation platform integration and clinical application module</strong></h2><p><strong>Main content: After the research and development of all the above modules is completed, we will carry out system-level integration, build an intelligent rehabilitation platform, and carry out functional verification and clinical testing. The integration work includes software and hardware interface connection, system joint debugging, user interface development and practical application plan formulation.</strong></p>\n<p>In terms of software integration, the focus is on seamlessly connecting the artificial consciousness <strong>Purpose training module (2) and the stimulus control module (3) and (4) to achieve a complete closed-loop transition from Purpose training to actual movement. When the patient is using it, the platform first runs an artificial consciousness training program, and the patient is trained on several virtual tasks to activate the brain</strong> Purpose signal. This is followed by the gradual introduction of real electrical stimulation, allowing virtual movements to occur in parallel with actual body movements, and finally transitioning to fully real motor training. This requires the software to be able to switch control modes according to the training phase, and to ensure that the artificial consciousness feedback and the electrical stimulation control are coordinated without conflict. We will develop a unified scheduling module to manage the operation of each subsystem according to the preset training process, such as the main virtual training in the first week, the addition of electrical stimulation synergy in the second week, and the full physical training in the Nth week. At the same time, the DIKWP structured evaluation module runs throughout, continuously collecting indicators at all levels to generate rehabilitation reports. The platform's software also includes a patient database, which stores each patient's training data, model parameters, and stage evaluation results for personalized adjustment and scientific analysis.</p>\n<p>In terms of hardware integration, it is necessary to combine the multi-channel stimulator with the rehabilitation training environment. We will set up a test bed or training room in the rehabilitation institution, equipped with implantable electrodes (if it is an implanted version, the neurosurgeon will need to complete the implantation surgery; In the case of the percutaneous version, the corresponding electrodes are installed), the stimulation unit, the computer, the VR device, etc. Ensure that the communication interface of the stimulator is connected with the host computer software, and the sensor data stream can be transmitted to the cognitive assessment module in real time. Build a safety monitoring system, including ECG monitoring, emergency stop button, etc., to ensure that the stimulation can be disconnected and alarmed immediately in case of abnormal conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Clinical Validation Protocol: We plan to conduct a small-scale clinical trial in a joint rehabilitation hospital or neurosurgery center in the later stage of the project. No less than 5 eligible patients with paralysis (such as complete paraplegia AIS class A or B, level of injury above T12, complete paralysis of the lower limbs for more than 1 year) were recruited to participate in the study with the approval of the ethics committee and full informed consent. The clinical validation will adopt a single-group controlled trial design to evaluate the functional improvement of the platform before and after intervention. The main validation indicators included: muscle strength and motor function level (lower limb muscle strength assessment,</strong> Barthel index and other daily living ability scores), evoked range of motion (range of motion), motor purpose signal changes (EEG/EMG ERD power changes), and subjective feelings (pain, fatigue, self-control questionnaires). The training cycle is expected to be 3~6 months, and the training is carried out 3-5 times a week, about 1 hour each time. During the training process, the platform automatically records detailed data. <strong>The goal of success was set as: all subjects were able to tolerate the training without serious adverse events; At least 3 patients achieved previously unattainable motor functions after the intervention, such as being able to stand and step with assistance, or achieve partial autonomous control of leg movements in the supine position; The patient's brain motor</strong> purpose begins to be correlated with actual movements, for example, after the brain-computer linkage is removed, a patient can walk short distances with crutches with residual voluntary control (ideally, this indicates that the neural pathway is partially reconstructed and autonomic function is restored). In addition, the quality of life questionnaire showed a significant improvement in expected psychological state and self-care confidence. We will also invite rehabilitation doctors to compare and evaluate the differences between this platform and traditional rehabilitation methods, and collect suggestions for improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Promotion and application path: After verifying that the platform is safe and effective, we will actively promote its development in the direction of clinical application and industrialization on a larger scale. Specific measures include: 1) Standardization and adaptive improvement: According to the feedback from the clinical trial, the system is optimized to make it more stable and easy to use, and clinical use specifications and training manuals are compiled</strong> for rehabilitation therapists to learn and master. 2) <strong>Preparation for regulatory approval</strong>: Organize clinical data, prepare application materials in accordance with medical device regulatory requirements, and prepare for the next step of applying for medical device registration. In particular, if implantable electrodes are used, we need to conduct long-term safety tracking and may request a larger clinical trial (e.g., a multicenter trial) to meet regulatory requirements. 3) <strong>Industrial cooperation</strong>: seek cooperation with medical device companies or investors to productize key technology modules. For example, we work with qualified companies to develop commercial versions of implantable electrodes and stimulators to ensure that medical safety standards and production consistency requirements are met; Artificial consciousness rehabilitation software is packaged as commercial software, and technical support and upgrades are provided. 4) <strong>Demonstration application</strong>: Strive to establish a demonstration base in the National Center for Neurological Diseases or key rehabilitation hospitals, carry out continuous application, and invite more patients to experience. Through the promotion of typical success stories, the industry and the public will be more aware of the technology. We also plan to incorporate the results of this project into the rehabilitation engineering professional courses and continuing education programs of colleges and universities to cultivate more professionals. 5) <strong>Medical insurance and policy support</strong>: Actively cooperate with the health authorities and medical insurance departments to evaluate new technologies, provide data on the efficacy and cost benefits of the project, and promote the inclusion of \"cerebrospinal interface rehabilitation training\" in the price of medical services and the scope of medical insurance reimbursement. This will greatly promote the popularization of this technology.</p>\n<p>Through the above path, we will strive to realize the results of this project from the laboratory to clinical application within 5 years after the end of the project, and initially establish an innovation chain combining production, education, research and medicine. It is expected that this project will promote the leapfrog development in the field of intelligent neurorehabilitation in China: on the one hand, it will bring real functional improvement to paraplegic patients, and on the other hand, it will also cultivate a new generation of rehabilitation equipment products with independent intellectual property rights, seize the opportunity of the international market, and create huge social and economic benefits.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Phased-research-plans-and-milestones\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Phased-research-plans-and-milestones\" title=\"Phased research plans and milestones\"></a><strong>Phased research plans and milestones</strong></h1><p>To ensure that the project objectives are successfully achieved, we have developed a phased research plan with the following milestones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Phase 1 (Initial Project ~ End of Year 1): Theoretical Modeling and Key Algorithm Design.

The project team has outstanding advantages and a strong academic foundation: Professor Duan Yucong, the project leader, is an internationally renowned expert in artificial intelligence and cognitive computing, and has made a series of leading achievements in the field of DIKWP model and artificial consciousness. The DIKWP mesh cognitive model proposed by Professor Duan realizes multi-directional semantic feedback through mesh interaction, and the related research has been authorized by 114 domestic and foreign invention patents, providing a new path for AI interpretability and artificial consciousness construction. These patented technologies form a complete DIKWP technology system, including cognitive models, semantic operating systems, artificial consciousness architecture and other aspects. For example, Professor Duan's team has developed the world's first small-model, low-computing power explainable artificial consciousness software system DIKWP-AC, which is divided into two subsystems, mathematical and physiological, which can realize the interpretation and interaction of users' physiological and mathematical data on low-computing devices. The system has been initially applied in the field of medical diagnosis and has achieved remarkable results. These original results show that the team has a deep accumulation in artificial consciousness model design, semantic layer computing and cognitive interaction, which can be directly used in this project.</strong></p>\n<p>At the same time, the project also has a strong cooperative team and foundation in the field of neuromodulation and rehabilitation. The core members of the project team include experts in neurosurgery and rehabilitation medicine, who have presided over relevant scientific research projects and carried out clinical research on spinal cord stimulation, and have accumulated valuable experience. For example, the team of a rehabilitation hospital participated in <strong>the national project of \"Brain-Computer Interface Reconstruction of Motor Function</strong>\", and conducted research on the brain signal control exoskeleton of paraplegic patients, which has rich patient recruitment and evaluation capabilities. The team also maintains cooperation with domestic enterprises engaged in the research and development of implantable medical devices, and can obtain hardware support such as epidural electrodes and implanted signal amplifiers. All these provide a practical basis for the project in the development and clinical implementation of neural interface hardware.</p>\n<p>2. The progress of the preliminary work supports the key technologies of the project: Before the project application, we have carried out a series of pre-research work, and the preliminary results obtained prove the feasibility of the technical route of the project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>In terms of cognitive model</strong>, we have completed an application exploration of the DIKWP model in the medical field, which constructs a doctor-patient dialogue artificial consciousness simulation system, maps the information flow in the process of consultation to the five-layer cognitive process of DIKWP, and simulates the prototype of artificial consciousness in doctor-patient interaction through the state machine. This work gives us an intuitive understanding of how the DIKWP model interfaces with physiological processes. For example, we have clarified in the model that the data layer corresponds to physiological signals, the knowledge layer corresponds to the medical knowledge base, and the Purpose layer corresponds to the purpose of doctor-patient communication. This laid the foundation for the use of DIKWP for motion control in this project.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>In terms of artificial consciousness algorithms</strong>, the team put forward the famous consciousness \"BUG\" theory, which compares the human consciousness process to a continuous \"text solitaire\" process, where most of the information processing is completed automatically in the subconscious, and only when an \"error\" occurs, it arouses conscious attention. Based on this, we developed an anomaly detection and arousal mechanism for artificial consciousness decision-making, which will be used in motor purpose training to determine when artificial consciousness should intervene for adjustment. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN A PATIENT TRIES AN ACTION SEVERAL TIMES WITHOUT SUCCESS, THE SYSTEM DETECTS THE ACCUMULATION OF DEVIATIONS (THE APPEARANCE OF \"BUGS\"), WHICH TRIGGERS ARTIFICIAL CONSCIOUSNESS TO PROVIDE A NEW GUIDANCE STRATEGY. This mechanism has been proven in the medical dialogue system we have developed, and it is very effective in improving the efficiency of interaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>In terms of electrical stimulation control</strong>, the engineers of the project team have participated in the development of a 16-channel electromyographic stimulation rehabilitation instrument for upper limb motor function training of stroke patients, which has passed the prototype test. In the process, we have mastered the basic methods of multi-channel electrical stimulation synchronous output and electromyography feedback acquisition, and developed the corresponding software interface. This is similar to the stimulator design of this project, which can reuse related software and hardware modules. In addition, we have built a simple human lower limb biomechanical model and FES simulation platform, simulated the knee angle control in Matlab, and achieved tracking control of flexion and extension movements by stimulating the quadriceps and hamstrings through dual channels. The simulation results show that the closed-loop control can significantly reduce the angular error, which is better than the open-loop stimulation. This provides us with the confidence to expand to multi-joint multi-channel control.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>In terms of clinical resources</strong>, our team worked closely with the Rehabilitation Department of Hainan Provincial People's Hospital to jointly establish the \"Intelligent Rehabilitation Joint Laboratory\". The hospital has agreed to open up the source of the disease for this project and assign doctors with rich experience in SCI rehabilitation to participate in the project. We have conducted initial follow-up and screening of several patients with spinal cord injury, collecting their basic information and needs. This means that once the project is in the clinical phase, we can expect to start the trial quickly without having to establish a clinical connection from scratch.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Perfect scientific research conditions and guarantees: The supporting units provide sufficient scientific research conditions for the project. We have provincial and ministerial key laboratories,</strong> equipped with first-class software and hardware facilities in the direction of cognitive computing and brain-like intelligence. The lab has a high-performance computing server farm for deep learning model training and large-scale simulation; Equipped with EEG EEG acquisition equipment, EMG signal analyzer, high-precision 3D motion capture system, etc., it can meet the needs of physiological signal acquisition and kinematic analysis. In addition, the electronic process center of the relying unit can support multi-layer circuit board manufacturing and system integration testing, and provides the necessary instruments for the development of multi-channel stimulators (such as high-speed oscilloscopes, signal generators, EMC test equipment). During the clinical trial phase, the partner hospital will provide beds, operating rooms and rehabilitation training venues to ensure that the trial is conducted safely. The project budget has also fully considered the costs of reagents, animal experiments, clinical subsidies and other expenses, and the funds are guaranteed.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Risk response measures: We fully anticipated the technical challenges of the project and formulated corresponding plans. For example, if the implantable electrode approval process is affecting the schedule, we have prepared an alternative</strong>: a clinical trial with a percutaneous electrode to verify the results before applying for implantation for long-term use. In terms of artificial consciousness algorithms, if the initial effect of the whole model is not ideal, we can also settle for the next best thing, adopt a more mature training mode based on EEG feedback, and gradually integrate cognitive elements to reduce the difficulty of implementation. At the same time, our multidisciplinary team helps to control risks holistically: engineering staff are responsible for technical details, and medical staff strictly monitor safety and ethics to ensure that the project is on track.</p>\n<p>In summary, we have an excellent team, solid preliminary results and complete scientific research conditions, and we are full of confidence in the completion of this project. Each key technology of the project has a corresponding foundation and reserves, and the combination of innovative theoretical frameworks (DIKWP× DIKWP and artificial consciousness) and specific implementation means has been verified and feasible on a small scale. With the development of the project, we will continue to learn from the latest research progress at home and abroad (such as the relevant results published in Nature and other journals) to maintain the advanced nature and correct direction of the program. With the strong support of feasibility and foundation, the smooth implementation of the project is fully guaranteed.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Expected-Outcomes-and-Appraisal-Indicators\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Expected-Outcomes-and-Appraisal-Indicators\" title=\"Expected Outcomes and Appraisal Indicators\"></a><strong>Expected Outcomes and Appraisal Indicators</strong></h1><p>The project is expected to produce a wealth of scientific research and application results, and we will set assessment indicators from the two levels of scientific research and technology application to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of the project:</p>\n<p><strong>(1) Scientific research achievements:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Monographs: Published no less than 8 papers in high-level academic journals or conferences at home and abroad</strong>.

At the same time, the output value of related industries is expected to reach 100 million yuan. We'll track subsequent conversions of your project and include them in your long-term assessment.</p>\n<p>In short, the achievement assessment of this project will combine quantitative indicators with qualitative evaluation, focusing not only on the quantity and quality of hard results, but also on the verification of actual clinical effects and feedback on user satisfaction. We will carry out mid-term and final self-evaluation in strict accordance with the above-mentioned indicator system to ensure that all expected goals are completed on schedule and with high quality.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Clinical-Validation-Plan-and-Achievement-Promotion-Pathway\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Clinical-Validation-Plan-and-Achievement-Promotion-Pathway\" title=\"Clinical Validation Plan and Achievement Promotion Pathway\"></a><strong>Clinical Validation Plan and Achievement Promotion Pathway</strong></h1><p>1. Clinical Validation Program: The ultimate goal of this project is to apply to patients with paralysis, so clinical validation is a crucial part. We will steadily advance clinical trials in accordance with medical device and clinical research specifications to ensure scientific, reliable and meaningful conclusions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Subject selection: According to the previous protocol, we plan to recruit 510 patients with complete spinal cord injury (ASIA grade A or B), with a predominantly thoracolumbar injury level (avoiding high neck injury to reduce the risk of the trial), age 2050 years, and more than 1 year post-injury time (entering the chronic stable phase). The inclusion criteria include: stable physical and mental condition, no serious complications, able to cooperate with training, and strong willingness to recover; Exclusion criteria include: risk of deep infection, severe osteoporosis, pacemaker and other conditions that are not suitable for electrical stimulation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Ethical approval and informed consent: Before initiating clinical trials, we will submit research protocols to the medical ethics committees of partner hospitals and supporting units to ensure that they meet the ethical requirements of human trials. All subjects were required to sign an informed consent form before participating to clearly understand the purpose, process and possible risks of the trial.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Trial group design: all subjects received the intervention of this project, and there was no no intervention control group (considering that the complete control was inhumane and the significance of the comparison was limited due to the small sample size). However, we will collect a series of baseline data from patients before the intervention as a control reference. In addition, indirect comparisons with historical data from previous conventional rehabilitation therapies may be considered.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Intervention process: After the subjects are enrolled, the implantation surgery</strong> (if the implanted electrode regimen is used) is performed first. After the postoperative recovery period (about 2 weeks), the interventional training will begin. Training is usually scheduled in an outpatient/day rehabilitation center for 60-90 minutes 3-5 times a week, and the entire trial intervention period is approximately 3-6 months. The training content includes: artificial consciousness-guided motor purpose imagination exercises, electrical stimulation-induced action exercises with increasing difficulty, and comprehensive task-oriented training (such as standing transfer, walking and other situational simulations). Assisted by rehabilitation therapists on site, technicians monitor the operation of the equipment. During the training process, special attention is paid to the gradual establishment of patient active participation: the system may be automatically led in the early stage, and the patient's voluntary triggering action may be fought for in the later stage.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Safety monitoring: The subject's vital signs are monitored throughout the process, focusing on skin condition</strong> (to avoid burns or pressure damage in the electrode area), <strong>spasticity</strong> (to prevent fractures caused by inducing severe muscle spasms, etc.), and <strong>autonomic reactions</strong>(high paraplegic anti-autonomic hyperreflexia) and so on. In case of abnormalities such as sudden increase in blood pressure, excessive sweating, persistent increase in heart rate, etc., immediately suspend stimulation and carry out medical intervention. Check the electrode position and wound healing regularly. We have detailed adverse event contingency plans, equipped with first-aid medications and equipment to respond to possible medical emergencies.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Efficacy assessment: Subjects were assessed in multiple dimensions before the intervention (Baseline), during the interim (e.g., 8 weeks), and at the end of the intervention, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Neurological function assessment: the changes in sensory and motor grades were recorded using the international ASIA rating standard scale. Lower Extremity Motor Score (LEMS); Assessment of muscle tone (Ashworth scale).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Functional independence: Improvement in functional independence of living was assessed using the Functional Independence Measure of Spinal Cord Injury (SCIM) or the Barthel index.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Athletic ability: Specific movement tests, such as standing time in parallel bars, stride distance, six-minute wheelchair pushing test distance, etc., may be adjusted according to the actual situation of the patient.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Objective indicators: evoked electromyography (MEP) assessment, recording the changes in the threshold and amplitude of peripheral electromyography response under electrical stimulation or brain stimulation; Gait analysis (if you can walk, record the change in stride length and gait speed); Balance ability (balance plate test).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Purpose signaling: If possible, some patients are given EEG/EMG laboratory tests before and after training, such as trying to imagine movements to see if the ERD/ERS changes increase.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Psychosocial: Questionnaires were used to investigate depression and anxiety scales, quality of life (e.g., SF-36), and to understand the impact of rehabilitation on psychological state.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The results of each patient's assessment will be archived and, if necessary, we will ask independent experts to conduct blind reviews of the footage and data to improve the objectivity of the conclusions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Statistical analysis: Due to the limited sample size, we mainly used descriptive statistics to perform significance tests (such as paired t-tests or non-parametric tests) based on the before and after changes of each case of their own controls. If the sample is large enough, the average improvement rate is also calculated and confidence intervals are given. It is important to report the details of each patient, as small trials are more focused on individual outcomes and feasibility statements. We also plan to conduct an exploratory analysis of differences in response between patients with different levels of injury and different age lines to provide clues for future improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2. Promotion and application path: After completing the clinical verification and proving the safety and effectiveness of the system, we will start to promote the diffusion and application of the results, and the main steps are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Registration and approval: Organize clinical data and apply for a medical device registration certificate for this product according to the approval process of the State Food and Drug Administration for innovative medical devices. If it is not possible to register directly at the end of the project, we will also actively seek to join the special approval channel for innovative medical devices to accelerate the transformation. We prepare sufficient technical documentation, including product specifications, manufacturing processes, clinical data reports, etc., to ensure that regulatory requirements are met.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Industry incubation: The relying unit or partner has a plan to set up a technology-based start-up company</strong> to promote the industrialization of the project's products. The engineering staff and management personnel in the project team will participate in the formation of the company, and strive to complete the company registration and initial financing within one year of the completion of the project. Then the company takes the main body to obtain the production license and establish the production line. We have assessed the preliminary market demand, and even if only 10% of the tens of thousands of new paraplegic cases and hundreds of thousands of existing patients in China use this system every year, the market size is considerable. Startups can quickly occupy the market by cooperating with rehabilitation equipment manufacturers or licensing.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Clinical demonstration and training: 2-3 large-scale rehabilitation centers are selected to carry out clinical demonstration applications</strong>. Through the successful cases of the demonstration base, more medical peers are invited to observe and learn. The team will develop detailed training materials and conduct workshops to teach doctors and therapists in other hospitals how to use the system, including patient screening, electrode implantation techniques, training program development, etc. We aim to train more than 50 professionals who can operate the system within three years and form an application network.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Inclusion in the rehabilitation system: Communicate with the health authorities to promote the inclusion of \"central-peripheral nerve interface training\" in the routine rehabilitation treatment. For example, it has been included in the updated version of the Chinese Guidelines for Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation, as one of the recommended therapies, to increase its acceptance in the industry. It is also possible to issue expert consensus or guidelines with relevant societies to clarify the indications, operating procedures, evaluation methods, etc., and lower the threshold for each unit to carry out this technology.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Continuous improvement and upgrading: The feedback collected during the promotion process will feed back into R&amp;D. We plan to establish a user feedback mechanism, and the company arranges technical support personnel to regularly visit various application units to record problems and provide solutions. At the same time, we will pre-develop next-generation products, such as a fully implantable system that more closely integrates brain signal acquisition and stimulation, or customized versions for other indications such as upper limb paralysis and stroke, to maintain technological leadership. In the future, it can also be considered to connect with the national key project of brain-computer interface, and expand this product with the help of national strength.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>International cooperation and output: The technology of this project is at the forefront of the world, and we will actively participate in international exchanges, promote it in academic conferences, and publish the results in foreign journals to enhance its international influence. Once the domestic application certificate is mature, you can seek overseas certification and open up the international market. In particular, developing countries along the \"Belt and Road\" have a huge demand for low-cost and efficient rehabilitation technology, and we can export this achievement through technology transfer and cooperative medical services to serve more patients.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, after the project is completed, our work will not stop, but will enter a new phase of conversion promotion. Through the combination of scientific research and industry, we can finally make innovative achievements truly applied to clinical practice and benefit patients, which is our original intention. It is believed that with the strong support of national policies and our effective promotion measures, the \"spinal-peripheral nerve interface regulation and rehabilitation system based on DIKWP×DIKWP model and artificial consciousness\" will not only stop at the research results, but also become an advanced rehabilitation tool for daily use in medical institutions, and promote traditional rehabilitation medicine to move towards a new era of intelligence and personalization. We expect that the successful implementation and promotion of this project will bring new hope to paraplegic patients, win an international reputation for China in the field of brain-computer interface and intelligent rehabilitation, and produce significant social and economic benefits.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

However, the existing non-invasive BCI is limited by signal resolution and reliability, and it is difficult to decode the fine-grained information of the deep structure of the brain, resulting in a high error rate. At the same time, traditional BCI mostly focuses on pattern recognition at the signal level, lacks understanding of the semantic level of brain activity, and is difficult to effectively intervene in complex cognitive states (such as emotion and purpose). This is particularly prominent in the intervention of neuropsychiatric diseases: anxiety disorders, [post-traumatic stress disorder]{.underline} (PTSD), etc., are characterized by abnormal emotional circuits in the brain, and existing drugs and superficial brain stimulation therapy often have limited effect, and a large number of patients do not respond to first-line treatment. There is an urgent need for a more accurate, controllable and intelligent brain-computer interaction method to decode and regulate specific states of the brain and provide innovative therapies for related diseases.</p>\n<p>The rise of high spatiotemporal resolution ultrasound brain-computer interface technology provides new ideas for the above problems. Ultrasound is non-invasive, deep-focused, and can directly regulate the activity of deep subcortical nuclei such as [the amygdala and]{.underline} other emotion-related areas through low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU). Compared with transcranial magnetic stimulation and other methods that mainly affect the cortex, ultrasound can precisely act on deep neural circuits, avoid roundabout adjustment, and improve the potential for efficacy. At the same time, functional [ultrasound imaging]{.underline} (fUS) can detect local blood flow changes in the brain with extremely high sensitivity and spatial resolution, which is highly correlated with neuronal discharge, providing a new means to obtain brain activity between EEG and fMRI. Studies have shown that fUS can achieve a spatial resolution of about 100 microns and a temporal resolution of less than 1 second, and can cover centimeter-level brain regions in a single image. This large-scale, high-precision brain imaging capability enables non-invasive BCI to combine the accuracy of previous invasive electrodes with the breadth of whole-brain coverage. Recently, some studies have tried to introduce tFUS neuromodulation into the BCI circuit, in order to reduce the error rate of BCI and enhance the interaction effect. For example, targeting transcranial ultrasound to the V5 region of the visual cortex can significantly reduce the error rate of BCI spelling tasks while enhancing the rhythmic activity of related brain regions. These advances indicate the dual role of ultrasound in BCI: it can be used as a high-precision information acquisition channel and an execution channel to intervene in brain state, laying the foundation for the construction of a closed-loop brain-computer interface system.</p>\n<p>Although ultrasound neuromodulation has shown preliminary results in improving BCI performance and treating psychiatric disorders, most of the existing studies use open-loop or pre-set stimulation strategies, and lack intelligent closed-loop regulation. For example, ultrasound intervention trials in patients with anxiety/PTSD have shown a significant reduction in anxiety and traumatic stress scores with no serious adverse effects after several weeks of daily ultrasound stimulation; Another study using ultrasound stimulation of the auricular vagus nerve similarly observed significant relief in anxiety and depression symptoms. However, most of these treatments are based on fixed-parameter stimulation and have not been adaptively adjusted to changes in individual brain status. In order to further improve the efficacy and reduce side effects, it is urgent to introduce closed-loop control: that is, to decode the patient's brain state in real time, dynamically adjust the stimulation strategy according to the treatment goal, and realize the automatic cycle of \"brain reading-recognition-decision-treatment\". This places higher demands on system intelligence: traditional algorithms struggle to understand high-level brain states or purposes, and are incapable of making such complex decisions. Therefore, we need to introduce a new type of artificial intelligence theory, the <strong>artificial consciousness model</strong>, so that the machine can have human-like semantic cognition and autonomous decision-making ability, so as to truly realize <strong>the closed-loop brain-computer interface centered on the patient's purpose and semantic state.</strong></p>\n<p>This project is guided by the \"Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom-Purpose\" artificial consciousness theory proposed by Professor Yucong Duan, focusing on **[high-spatiotemporal resolution ultrasound brain-computer interface]{.underline}**Application in the intervention of neuropsychiatric diseases. The DIKWP model provides a new cognitive architecture with a Purpose hierarchy, emphasizing the whole chain of semantic processing from raw data to high-level Wisdom decision-making to Purpose-oriented. Combined with the precise perception and regulation of the brain by ultrasound, we are expected to build a self-explanatory, <strong>purpose-driven brain-computer interaction system, so that the machine can \"read\" the semantic state of the brain and impose purposeful interventions, so as to more effectively alleviate the symptoms of anxiety,</strong> PTSD and other diseases. This will not only innovate the theoretical and technical connotation of brain-computer interface, but also open up a new path for the field of neuromodulation, which has important academic value and clinical significance.</p>\n<p>In summary, aiming at the current bottleneck of BCI and brain disease intervention, this project proposes to deeply integrate the DIKWP artificial consciousness model with high-resolution ultrasound brain-computer interface, aiming to achieve: brain state decoding of high-level semantic information, purpose-driven precise ultrasound intervention, adaptive closed-loop adjustment and self-explanatory decision-making. The expected results will make a breakthrough in the field of brain-computer interaction and artificial consciousness at the semantic layer in China, and lay a new foundation for intelligent medical care and brain-like AI in the future.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Theoretical-basis-DIKWP-network-artificial-consciousness-model\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Theoretical-basis-DIKWP-network-artificial-consciousness-model\" title=\"Theoretical basis: DIKWP network artificial consciousness model\"></a><strong>Theoretical basis: DIKWP network artificial consciousness model</strong></h1><p><strong>DIKWP Model Concept:</strong> DIKWP is an artificial consciousness framework composed of five hierarchical elements: Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom and Purpose. The model is extended by Professor Yucong Duan's team on the basis of the classic DIKW (pyramid) model, by adding a \"Purpose\" layer on top of knowledge-Wisdom, and breaking the traditional bottom-up one-way hierarchical structure, and adopting a network interaction structure. This means that the five elements in the DIKWP model can not only be transferred to each other, but can interact in both directions, so that there are 25 potential interaction paths in the system, 5×5. This network dynamic architecture is closer to the information flow pattern in the real brain: the cognitive processes in reality are not simple straight lines, but are full of feedback loops and parallel interactions, high-level purpose affects low-level perception, and memory emotions reshape the understanding of information. DIKWP is proposed to model this complexity, which scientifically incorporates the \"purpose\" into the cognitive process, emphasizing the guiding role of subjective goals on objective cognitive activities, so that artificial intelligence systems have human-like motivation-driven characteristics.</p>\n<p><strong>Mesh interaction and semantic dynamic transformation:</strong> In the DIKWP model, elements at each level can be input and output from each other, realize perceptual accumulation from the bottom up, realize purpose regulation from the top down, and carry out parallel information exchange at the same or across layers. For example, the \"Data → Information\" channel represents the meaningful pattern extracted from the original sensory data, the \"Knowledge ↔ Information\" represents the two-way impact of empirical knowledge on the current information processing, and the \"Purpose→ Wisdom\" reflects the guiding role of high-level goals in decision evaluation. These 25 basic transformation modules provide a complete semantic dynamic transformation mechanism for understanding and designing cognitive systems. In the neurophysiological research of Prof. Yucong Duan's team, the five elements of DIKWP have been preliminarily mapped to the main functional anatomical regions of the brain: <strong>data D corresponds to peripheral perceptual pathways such as the sensory cortex, information I corresponds to communication pathways such as the limbic system and primary prefrontal lobe, and knowledge K corresponds to</strong> long-term memory integration areas such as hippocampus and default mode network (DMN). <strong>Wisdom W corresponds to multimodal decision-making areas such as the parietal lobe symphysis and higher prefrontal lobe, and Purpose P corresponds to the motivational control areas such as the medial prefrontal lobe, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate gyrus. This</strong> brain-semantic mapping shows that each semantic level of DIKWP may find a corresponding physiological basis in the brain, which in turn supports us to implement the mutual translation of \"semantic space\" and \"physiological space\" in brain-computer interfaces. This project will further use the mapping model to develop [a]{.underline} decoding method from brain signals to semantic state, as well as a coding method from reverse semantic target to brain stimulation strategy (see the following chapters for details) to realize the semantic layer alignment and transformation of information between brain and computer.</p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Consciousness and</strong> <strong>[ACPU]{.underline}</strong> <strong>Framework: The</strong> DIKWP model provides an interpretable and controllable cognitive framework for artificial intelligence, which is regarded as an important foundation for moving towards artificial consciousness (AC). Under this framework, we introduce <strong>[the concept of the Artificial Consciousness Processing Unit]{.underline}</strong> <strong>(ACPU) as a software/hardware carrier and central controller to implement the DIKWP model. ACPU is essentially a heterogeneous agent architecture that integrates subliminal computing and conscious decision-making: it contains both GPU-like massively parallel processing units for low-level data and information processing, and CPU-like sequential logic units for high-level processing</strong> Wisdom and Purpose of inference decision-making, and establish a special semantic store and knowledge graph internally for the representation of knowledge levels. According to the existing design, the ACPU can be divided into multiple functional modules, such as the data processing unit (DPU), which is responsible for sensor data preprocessing and pattern extraction, and converts the original signal into a standardized conceptual representation; The Information Processing Unit (IPU) performs complex feature operations and content classification to refine higher-level structured information; Knowledge Processing Units (KPUs) build internal models and long-term experiences of the environment through learning and induction; Wisdom Processing Unit (WPU) integrates knowledge and value systems for judgment and reasoning, and introduces contextual, ethical and other considerations to form decision-making schemes; <strong>The Purpose Processing Unit (PPU) dynamically reconstructs the execution logic according to the top-level target to generate specific action instructions or control flows. Together, these modules realize the semantic processing and transformation of all layers of DIKWP, and architecturally ensure that the AI system \"knows why\" - each step has a clear semantic meaning and a traceable basis. It is worth mentioning that the relevant patent proposes a \"dual loop\" DIKWP ×DIKWP architecture: a set of metacognitive loops is added to the basic cognitive process, and the former is self-monitored and regulated. In other words, an ACPU can contain two layers of DIKWP processing: one layer for cognitive activities oriented to external tasks (object layer), and the other layer as a supervision layer to evaluate, reflect, and optimize the state of the former, thus giving the system a preliminary self-awareness ability. This project will draw on this \"dual circulation\" idea when designing ACPU, so that the system can self-monitor its decoding and decision-making process, detect deviations in time and adjust strategies, and ensure the safety and robustness of closed-loop control.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Model Advantages and Innovation:</strong> Compared with traditional black-box machine learning algorithms, the DIKWP artificial awareness model has many advantages: (1) Interpretability: The model decomposes complex decision-making processes into data→ information → knowledge→ and the evolution of Wisdom → Purpose, each step is clearly defined, and can be monitored and audited. This helps to solve the \"black box\" problem in the current large model, so that every behavior of AI is \"well documented\", and greatly improves the transparency and credibility of the system. (2) Purpose-driven: By explicitly incorporating \"Purpose\" into the model, system decisions are no longer driven solely based on data relevance, but are always optimized around preset goals. This ensures that AI behavior is aligned with human expectations for value, reducing the risk of irrelevant or even harmful outputs. (3) <strong>Human-machine semantic alignment: The DIKWP model provides a cognitive semantic space shared by humans and machines, allowing machines to represent and interpret information in a way that is close to human thinking. Professor Yucong Duan pointed out that the model builds a common cognitive language between humans and machines, and humans can understand the semantic meaning behind each step of AI reasoning. This is especially critical for brain-computer interfaces – it means that machines can \"understand\" the brain's language and respond in a way that humans can understand. (4) Adaptive evolution: The network structure and dual-loop architecture give the system the ability to self-regulate, and can continuously correct the internal state according to feedback, so as to achieve continuous learning and optimization. In summary, the DIKWP artificial consciousness model has laid a solid theoretical foundation for us to build a new generation of intelligent closed-loop BCI system, which is expected to break through the bottlenecks of semantic understanding, purpose decision-making and self-evolution of previous systems, and truly realize strong semantic perception and purpose-driven</strong> regulation.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Project-innovation\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Project-innovation\" title=\"Project innovation\"></a><strong>Project innovation</strong></h1><p>This project combines the above theoretical innovations with ultrasound brain-computer interface, and intends to break through the bottleneck of current brain-computer interaction, and the main innovations are reflected in the following aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>**1. Ternary semantic conversion mechanism of brain-ultrasound system-artificial consciousness: Establish a dynamic transformation model between brain signals, ultrasound media, and DIKWP artificial consciousness semantic space. This paper clarifies the representation of brain activity at the semantic level of \"data-information-knowledge-wisdom-purpose\", and the mapping and reduction mechanism in the machine semantic space through ultrasound interface, so as to realize the unified framework of decoding brain signals to semantic information and encoding from semantic purpose to brain stimulation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>2. ACPU hub and ultrasound linkage control for artificial consciousness: The artificial consciousness processing unit (ACPU) is introduced as the semantic center of the system, and the artificial consciousness model is integrated for closed-loop control decision-making. The ACPU will be tightly coupled with high spatiotemporal resolution ultrasound hardware to achieve purpose-driven stimulation strategy generation. Through ACPU's semantic understanding of brain states and prediction of future evolution paths, intelligent decision-making is made on when and where to apply ultrasound stimulation to optimize the evolution of brain states and achieve the purpose of autonomous regulation and precise intervention.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>**3. Bidirectional mapping model of semantic space and physiological space: <strong>Constructing</strong> \"semantic space (DIKWP)\" <strong>and</strong>A mapping model between physiological spaces (cerebral blood flow, neural activity patterns). In terms of decoding, a mapping from physiological signal features to semantic states (e.g., emotion, purpose) is established. In terms of regulation, the rules for the transformation from the target semantic effect to the specific stimulus parameter are defined. The mapping model will act as a bridge to ensure that the decoding and stimuli follow a common semantic coordinate system, so that the closed-loop system can use the \"understood\" information directly for the \"intervention\". For example, the model can be used to interpret the pattern of brain activity obtained from functional ultrasound imaging as a cognitive/emotional state, and then in turn to generate an ultrasound stimulation program based on the desired state change.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>4. Unified protocol standard for brain semantic decoding and stimulus coding: A unified brain-computer semantic interaction protocol is proposed to standardize the semantic representation of brain signals and the semantic coding of stimulus commands. The protocol will cover the description format of semantic content at all levels of DIKWP, the machine-understandable semantic tag system, and the interface specification of decoding/encoding conversion to ensure the consistency of semantic information transmission between different modules. The protocol design fully considers the implementation of software and hardware</strong>, so as to efficiently deploy on domestic brain-computer interface chips or special processors, and promote the formation of an independent and controllable standard system for brain-semantic interaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>**5. DIKWP-AI Adaptive Intervention Pathway for Anxiety/PTSD and Other Diseases: **Focus on exploring the application prospect of ultrasound neuromodulation in emotion-related diseases such as anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. Based on DIKWP artificial intelligence, the central system will evaluate the patient's brain semantic state (such as stress level, fear memory reproduction, etc.) in real time, and adaptively adjust the ultrasound stimulation parameters to achieve an individualized closed-loop intervention path. For example, when a semantic pattern of excessive anxiety is detected in the patient's brain, the system automatically triggers ultrasound stimulation for the amygdala/limbic system to alleviate symptoms. Through a large number of preclinical experiments and preliminary clinical trials, the efficacy and safety of this DIKWP semantic-driven AI intervention in alleviating pathological anxiety have been verified, and a new intelligent and adaptive therapy for the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases has been verified.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above-mentioned innovations cover the complete chain from basic theoretical models to engineering implementation to clinical applications, reflecting the depth of exploration in the multidisciplinary aspects of this project. Through these innovations, we will create an unprecedented self-interpreting closed-loop ultrasound brain-computer interface system, leading a new paradigm of brain-computer interaction from signal-driven to semantic-driven.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Core-system-architecture-design\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Core-system-architecture-design\" title=\"Core system architecture design\"></a><strong>Core system architecture design</strong></h1><p>In this architecture, <strong>the high spatiotemporal resolution ultrasound system plays a dual role. On the one hand, it utilizes functional ultrasound imaging techniques to obtain fine-grained images or signals of brain activity. For example, when the system is used for anxiety monitoring, ultrasound can detect hemodynamic changes in the limbic system (amygdala, hippocampus, etc.) and capture the occurrence of stress responses with millisecond temporal accuracy. These raw data are equivalent to the \"data (D)\" layer input in the DIKWP model</strong>, which needs to be transmitted to the upper-level ACPU for further semantic extraction due to unprocessed and lack of clear meaning. On the other hand, the ultrasound system also acts as an actuator: with the help of focused ultrasound stimulation technology, ultrasound pulses of specific parameters (frequency, intensity, pulse pattern, etc.) are applied to selected brain areas, directly altering the neural activity in that area. For example, ultrasound stimulation may relieve anxiety in an overactive amygdala by inhibiting nerve firing or modulating synaptic plasticity. Ultrasound stimulation corresponds to the \"action execution\" and can be seen as the realization in physical space of the external behavior derived by the \"Purpose (P)\" layer. It is important to note that imaging and stimulation are usually not performed at the same time, but rather in the working <strong>mode of the multiplex: the system can alternate ultrasound imaging (reading out brain activity) and ultrasound stimulation (writing regulation) on millisecond time slices, thus guaranteeing both continuous monitoring of the brain state and the ability to exert feedback control at a sufficiently fast frequency.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Artificial Consciousness Processing Unit (ACPU) is the brain of the whole system, which runs the DIKWP artificial consciousness model inside it to realize the semantic level analysis of signals from the brain and intelligent decision-making on regulatory strategies. Specifically, when the data stream from the ultrasound system enters the ACPU, it first undergoes data → information conversion</strong>: the underlying data processing module denoises and extracts the original signal, and organizes it into a mode with preliminary significance (corresponding to the I layer of DIKWP). For example, a series of amygdala blood flow signals can be processed to extract patterns such as \"tension/relaxation\". Subsequently, the <strong>information → knowledge conversion module combines context and memory to comprehensively analyze these patterns and determine their higher-level meanings (corresponding to K-layer). In the above example, the system may combine other physiological signals and historical data to determine that the user is currently in a state of knowledge such as \"triggering traumatic memory\" and \"being in the early stage of stress response\". Next,</strong> the ACPU enters the <strong>Wisdom (W) layer for decision reasoning: this layer synthesizes the expert knowledge built into the system, the ethical constraints, and the requirements of the current Purpose (P) layer to evaluate possible interventions. In our system, the Purpose (P) layer is usually composed of a combination of pre-set treatment goals and a real-time updated user Purpose. For example, for patients with PTSD, the goal layer includes goals such as \"relieving panic attacks\" and \"avoiding excessive suppression of normal emotions\". Based on this, the Wisdom layer weighs the pros and cons of different intervention options, such as \"immediate stimulation of the amygdala to reduce its activity\" versus \"diversion of the patient's attention\", and gives the best strategy. The Purpose (P) layer will finally generate specific ultrasound stimulation instructions based on the recommendations of the Wisdom layer, which will be executed by the ultrasound system. It should be emphasized that the ACPU is not a simple feedforward chain in the working process, but is equipped with a metacognitive monitoring mechanism: it continuously monitors the semantic correctness and consistency of the output of each layer (for example, whether the inference of the knowledge layer is consistent with the original evidence of the information layer,</strong> whether the decision of the Wisdom layer is in line with the ultimate goal), and once a deviation is detected, it will adjust the processing parameters of the previous layer through feedback signals to achieve self-calibration. This design corresponds to the above-mentioned \"dual circulation\" architecture, that is, the second set of DIKWP loops inside the ACPU supervises and regulates the first set to ensure that the system decision-making is robust, reliable, transparent and controllable.</p>\n<p>Closed-loop control process: Combining the above components, the closed-loop interaction process of the system is as follows: (1) Data collection: The neural activity generated by the brain is first obtained by ultrasound imaging to obtain real-time data, and after preprocessing, a structured information flow is formed and sent to the ACPU. (2) Semantic decoding: ACPU processes the information stream layer by layer, transforming it into a high-level semantic description of the current brain state within the DIKWP semantic space (e.g., identifying \"the patient is panicking\"). (3) Strategic decision-making: Based on the current semantic state and treatment goals, ACPU deduces the future state change path with the support of the internal knowledge base and artificial consciousness model, and selects the best intervention strategy. (4) Instruction encoding: The selected strategy is encoded as a specific sequence of ultrasound stimulation parameters (target, sound intensity, duration, etc.) as ACPU output. (5) Execution and feedback: The ultrasound system receives instructions and exerts stimulation to the corresponding brain area, causing changes in brain activity; At the same time, brain signals continue to be monitored, and changes are fed back to the ACPU. (6) <strong>Cyclic iteration: ACPU compares the brain semantic state before and after stimulation, evaluates the intervention effect, and adjusts the strategy to enter the next cycle if the goal is not reached, until the termination condition is met (symptom relief or end of the preset course of treatment). Through such closed-loop iteration, the system can \"read\" the patient's brain like a skilled therapist at all times, and \"prescribe the right medicine\"</strong> to achieve highly intelligent brain state regulation.</p>\n<p>In short, this architecture integrates the hardware tool of high-resolution ultrasound with the software Wisdom of DIKWP artificial consciousness to form a complete closed loop of \"perception-cognition-action\". It breaks through the limitations of traditional brain-computer interfaces that only use one-way information reading or preset stimuli, and instead creates a new type of agent that can understand brain semantics, actively make decisions and govern, and self-supervise evolution. Below we will further break down the stage tasks, technical roadmap and key module design of the project implementation.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Study-content-and-task-decomposition-in-stages\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Study-content-and-task-decomposition-in-stages\" title=\"Study content and task decomposition in stages\"></a><strong>Study content and task decomposition in stages</strong></h1><p>In order to promote the research of this project in an orderly manner, we divide the task into three stages according to the difficulties and logical relationships, and each stage focuses on overcoming a number of key problems to achieve the project goals step by step.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Phase 1 (Theoretical Modeling and Key Technology Research, Estimated 1-2 Years):</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><p>DIKWP Semantic Modeling: Improve the theoretical model of brain-ultrasound-artificial consciousness interaction. Based on the existing DIKWP semantic mathematical framework, a semantic representation method of brain signals was established to define the correspondence and transformation functions between each DIKWP level and typical neural activity patterns. The mathematical representation of the brain semantic state space is formed, which provides a theoretical basis for the subsequent algorithm development.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Development of semantic decoding algorithms: Development of multi-level brain signal decoding algorithms for high spatiotemporal resolution ultrasound data. Including: limbic system emotional signal extraction, whole brain functional network dynamic analysis, semantic feature extraction, etc., to extract useful information from each layer of DIKWP from massive time series. Try to use the combination of machine learning/deep learning and knowledge graph to integrate data-driven and prior knowledge to improve the accuracy of semantic decoding.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Stimulation Strategy Optimization Model: Study the purpose-driven decision-making mechanism and establish a mapping model from semantic goals to stimulus parameters. Reinforcement learning or optimization algorithms are used to simulate the influence of different stimulation schemes on the evolution of brain states, and a stimulus strategy optimization framework is formed. In particular, consider incorporating security constraints and ethical rules into decision-making (the Wisdom layer) to ensure that the resulting policies are safe and feasible.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <strong>Phase 2 (Prototype System Development and Simulation Validation, Expected Year 2-3):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Closed-loop system prototype integration: Develop hardware and software prototypes to integrate the ACPU software platform with ultrasound imaging/stimulation devices. Write interface programs to realize data collection, instruction sending, and real-time communication, and initially build a closed-loop operating environment. The human-computer interface is designed to monitor the semantic state and decision-making process within the system, and to facilitate debugging and demonstration of its interpretability.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Simulation Platform Testing: Simulation validation of prototype systems in vitro/offline environments. Firstly, a virtual brain environment</strong> (such as a digital twin based on computational models or offline physiological data) was established to simulate various controllable brain state change scenarios (such as progressively enhanced anxiety and stress responses), and the accuracy and response speed of ACPU decoding these states were verified. Then, software in-the-loop simulation was introduced to simulate the impact of ultrasound stimulation on the virtual brain model, and the convergence and stability of closed-loop decision-making were tested. If possible, further ex vivo tissue experiments (e.g., brain slices or cell models) are carried out to validate the ultrasound stimulus-neural response relationship to lay the groundwork for application in overall biological systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Key Indicator Evaluation: Evaluate the performance indicators of the prototype system in the simulation environment, including: decoding accuracy (the accuracy of semantic state recognition), decision delay (the time taken by a loop in a loop), stimulus control accuracy (the deviation of the degree of brain state regulation relative to the target), etc. Algorithms and parameters are continuously improved in response to identified issues. If the decoding accuracy is not up to standard, the feature extraction method will be optimized, and if the decision delay is too long, the ACPU calculation process will be optimized or hardware acceleration will be used to ensure that the prototype has the performance level to enter the next animal experiment.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <strong>Phase 3 (Animal Experiments and Initial Clinical Validation, Expected Year 4-5):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Animal model experiments: Select appropriate animal models (such as rodent mice or rats) to carry out in vivo closed-loop regulation experiments to verify the effectiveness and safety of the system in real biological systems. Animal models of stress disorder (e.g., mice that are dosed to induce anxiety-like behaviors) can be implanted or fixed with an ultrasound probe to monitor the ultrasound signal in anxiety-related regions of the brain (amygdala, hypothalamus, etc.) in real time. When an abnormal anxiety state is detected in the animal, ultrasound stimulation is triggered by the ACPU decision to intervene. To observe the effects of the intervention on behavioral and physiological indicators (e.g., heart rate, stress hormone levels) and to verify changes in brain activity by neuroimaging methods. Key evaluations: (1) the accuracy of the system in detecting abnormal brain states</strong>, (2) the effectiveness of closed-loop intervention in alleviating abnormal behaviors, and (3) the safety of ultrasound stimulation on tissues under long-term repeated action (with microbleeding, inflammation, etc.). According to the experimental results, the system parameters such as stimulation dose, monitoring threshold, ACPU decision rules, etc. were adjusted.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Preparation for preliminary clinical trials: On the premise of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of animal experiments, we will cooperate with medical institutions to carry out trial or preclinical testing of small sample volunteers. A small number of patients with anxiety/PTSD who are refractory to medication were selected to participate in the trial with informed consent. For the sake of safety, an intervention model that is acceptable to the population</strong>, such as the use of ultrasound closed-loop adjustment during the patient's psychological exposure therapy, can be used to alleviate the excessive stress response in real time. The effect of the system on humans was evaluated step by step, including changes in symptom scores, subjective feelings of the patient, and any discomfort. Collect feedback from doctors and patients, improve the human-computer interaction interface and use process, and formulate a perfect plan for formal clinical trials.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Clinical Translational Analysis: Evaluate the advantages and potential benefits of the system over traditional treatments based on trial data, such as improvement in anxiety scores, onset time, patient compliance, etc. At the same time, the challenges that may be faced in clinical translation (such as model generalization problems caused by individual differences, device portability and cost issues, regulatory and ethical requirements) are identified, and corresponding solutions and improvement routes are formulated. For example, consider using a customized head-mounted ultrasound device to improve convenience, or introduce more patient data to retrain the ACPU model to improve robustness. Make technical and strategic reserves for subsequent large-scale clinical applications.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Through the implementation of the above three phases, we will gradually turn the proof of concept into a practical system: from theoretical models and algorithms, to closed-loop prototypes, to biological experiments and clinical exploration, and finally to achieve the project goals. At the end of each phase, we conduct a milestone assessment to ensure that the progress and quality of the study is as expected, and to provide clear guidance for the next phase.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Technical-route-and-scheme-design\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Technical-route-and-scheme-design\" title=\"Technical route and scheme design\"></a><strong>Technical route and scheme design</strong></h1><p>In order to achieve the goal of the project, we comprehensively use multidisciplinary methods such as brain science, artificial intelligence, and ultrasound engineering, and design the following technical routes to ensure the systematization and efficiency of the research:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>(1) Brain semantic feature extraction: Firstly, multi-level feature extraction and representation are performed on brain signals from ultrasound imaging. The combination of signal processing and deep learning is used to extract the feature set that can characterize the semantics of each layer of DIKWP. For example, low-level data features are obtained by frequency domain analysis and wavelet transform on the original time series</strong>. Use graph algorithms or network analysis to extract network features of the knowledge layer from the functional connection matrix; A pre-trained neural network is used to extract high-level features related to emotion/cognitive state from brain images, corresponding to <strong>the Wisdom/Purpose layer, etc. This step focuses on maximizing the retention of valid information in the brain signals and reorganizing them in a meaningful way to lay the foundation for subsequent semantic mapping.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>(2) DIKWP semantic mapping modeling: Establish a formal semantic mapping model</strong> to map the above multi-level features to the corresponding positions in the DIKWP semantic space. Specifically, the mapping functions $f_D, f_I, f_K, f_W, and f_P$ are designed, which correspond to the process of converting the observed feature vectors into semantic variables at each layer, respectively. For example, $f_I$ maps several low-level data features to an informational semantic label (e.g., \"fear\" signal appears), $f_K$ further maps the set of information labels to knowledge states (e.g., \"recalls a specific traumatic situation\"), and so on until $f_P$ gives an estimate of the purpose of the current subject (e.g., \"fleeing a potential threat\"). These mappings can be learned by machine learning models or constructed in part based on expert knowledge. During the training process, the parameters of these mappings are optimized to accurately reflect the true semantics through the annotated data of known semantic states (such as experiment-induced emotional states).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>(3) Artificial consciousness decision reasoning: After obtaining the DIKWP semantic representation of the current brain state, the ACPU initiates the artificial consciousness model for decision reasoning. This step combines two paradigms: symbolic inference and data-driven prediction: symbolic inference uses the rules embedded in the DIKWP model (such as adjusting the</strong> judgment criteria of the Wisdom layer according to the purpose layer) to logically evaluate the current state; The data-driven part uses the trained strategy network or value network to score and evaluate different candidate stimulus actions. In terms of implementation, the actor-critic architecture in reinforcement learning can be adopted, in which the actor network outputs an action (stimulus scheme) based on the current semantic state, and the critic network evaluates whether the action is helpful to achieve the purpose (based on the knowledge within the model and the external reward signal). In addition, incorporating safety rules and ethical constraints (such as the upper limit of stimulus amplitude, not touching non-targeted functional areas, etc.) in the inference process is equivalent to setting boundary conditions for decision-making at the Wisdom layer to ensure that the resulting scheme is feasible and safe.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>(4) Ultrasound stimulation coding and execution: Once the optimal stimulation protocol is determined (e.g., \"pulse stimulation to reduce amygdala activity for 3 seconds\"), the system enters the action implementation phase. According to the requirements of the protocol, it is coded into specific groups of ultrasound stimulation parameters</strong>: including the location of action (controlled by the ultrasonic phased array focus), frequency intensity (selected according to physiological effects, such as low-frequency bias neural modulation, high-frequency bias memory intervention), and modulation mode (continuous/pulsed wave, pulse duty cycle, etc.). These parameters are delivered through the drive interface of the ultrasonic device and converted into the electrical signal output of the ultrasonic probe, which in turn generates the desired ultrasonic field at the physical level. In this step, it is necessary to solve the parameter inversion problem, that is, calculate the corresponding ultrasound technical parameters according to the desired biological effect. This can be done through simulation and experimental calibration: a pre-established response curve or database of ultrasound parameters to neural effects (e.g., the intensity of neural excitation/inhibition effects at different frequencies) for decision-making table lookup or interpolation. At the same time, ensure that the stimulus sequence is within the range of hardware real-time, and if necessary, the signal is optimized to avoid hardware bottlenecks (such as limiting the switching frequency, loading waveform buffers in advance, etc.).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>(5) Closed-loop evaluation and adjustment: After the stimulation is performed, the system re-enters the monitoring mode to evaluate the changes in brain state. If the goal has not been reached, move on to the next closed loop. The key in this process is the feedback evaluation algorithm</strong>: by comparing the differences in DIKWP semantic vectors before and after stimulation, the intervention effect is quantitatively evaluated. We'll define a set of evaluation metrics, such as \"semantic error\" $E = | S_{current} - S_{target}|$ indicates the distance between the current semantic state and the target state. If $E$ is insufficient, the algorithm considers whether to adjust the strategy: for example, to increase the intensity of the stimulus, to change the stimulus site, or to infer that the current hypothesis (knowledge-level judgment) may be wrong if multiple cycles are ineffective, and the interpretation of the brain state needs to be reverted and re-amended (triggering metacognitive feedback of the ACPU). Through this closed-loop adjustment mechanism, the system can continuously modify its own behavior and approach the optimal treatment pathway.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>(6) Human-machine interface and manual intervention: Although the system is highly automated, we still reserve the interface for manual monitoring and intervention. At each step of the technical route, the internal status can be projected to the operator. For example, visualizing the semantic labels currently decoded, ACPU decision justification (why the stimulus was chosen), etc., to achieve truly explainable AI-assisted medicine. Doctors can intervene as needed: for example, when the system misjudges</strong> the purpose, the doctor can manually correct the semantic tag; or adjust system goals based on patient subjective feedback. This human-robot collaborative interface design ensures medical safety and ethical requirements, and also provides a valuable basis for further optimization of algorithms.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above-mentioned technical routes form a closed loop from information acquisition, semantic modeling, intelligent decision-making to executive feedback. Each step is relatively independent and closely connected, forming an overall solution to the problem. In the implementation process, we will concretize each link according to the phase focus, such as the first phase is mainly completed (1) (2), the second stage is improved (3) (4), and the third stage is tested (5) and (6) and integrated into human supervision. Through multiple rounds of iterative development and verification, the performance and adaptability of each link are gradually optimized, and a stable and efficient closed-loop system is finally realized.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Design-of-simulation-system-and-experimental-platform\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Design-of-simulation-system-and-experimental-platform\" title=\"Design of simulation system and experimental platform\"></a><strong>Design of simulation system and experimental platform</strong></h1><p>Building a high-fidelity simulation system is critical to validating and refining our protocol before moving into real-world biological experiments. This project will develop a hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform to simulate the closed-loop process of real brain-computer interfaces in a virtual environment, so as to find and solve problems at a low cost and high efficiency. The design of the simulation platform considers the following aspects:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Virtual brain and environmental modeling: Based on the neurotic point model or neural network simulation, we will build a virtual brain model</strong>, focusing on the brain regions and pathways related to anxiety and stress. For example, the Wilson-Cowan model can be used to simulate the dynamics of the amygdala-prefrontal cortex circuit, and its parameters can be adjusted to show a high activity state similar to anxiety attacks. Or leverage an open-source brain simulation platform such as TheVirtualBrain to build neural network models that incorporate limbic systems. The virtual brain model will act as a controlled object for a closed-loop system, capable of receiving simulated \"ultrasound stimulus\" inputs (e.g., changing the weights of certain connections or neuronal excitability) and generating state changes, while outputting signals that can be acquired by \"ultrasound imaging\" (e.g., \"blood flow\" time series in various regions). In addition, we will build a simple virtual body and environment model, so that the virtual brain state can be mapped to behavioral performance (such as anxiety levels affecting imaginary heart rate, exercise behavior, etc.), creating an observable and interactive simulation environment.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Ultrasound device model: In the simulation, we need a device model that approximates the behavior of a real ultrasound system</strong>. This includes: a beam characteristic model of an ultrasound probe to calculate the energy distribution acting on a specific brain region under a given parameter; The sampling and noise model of ultrasound imaging is used to add noise and resolution limitations to the virtual brain after the \"ground truth\" signal is generated to obtain a simulated observation signal. We will refer to the literature and experimental data to establish formulas or look-up tables for the propagation characteristics of ultrasound of different frequencies and intensities in brain tissue, and consider the effects of skull attenuation. For the imaging part, the sampling process of spatial resolution (about 100 microns) and temporal resolution (tens of milliseconds) is simulated to ensure that the simulated data and future real data have similar statistical characteristics.</p>\n<p><strong>3. ACPU software simulation: We can choose two implementation methods for ACPU running in the simulation environment: one is to directly run the real ACPU software we developed, just connect the input and output to the virtual model to realize the loop-in-the-loop test of the whole system</strong>； Second, in order to test more quickly, an accelerated simulation version of ACPU can also be developed, which directly represents the behavior of each module with high-level mathematical functions. For example, a function is used to approximate the mapping of virtual brain signals to the semantic state (skipping the details of the deep learning model) and outputs stimulus decisions based on pre-set policy rules. This fast simulation mode can be used for a wide range of parametric searches and proof-of-concept scenarios. In the early stages of the project, we will mainly use the second way to iterate quickly; After the real ACPU software is formed, switch to the first method for full-link verification.</p>\n<p>**4. Data Logging &amp; Visualization: The simulation platform will have sophisticated data logging and visualization tools. In each simulation run, we record all the information about the \"true state\" of the virtual brain, ultrasound observations, the semantic state of ACPU resolution, the details of the decision-making process, and the final output stimulus. This data will be used for offline analysis to verify that the modules are working as intended. For example, it is possible to verify whether the semantics parsed by the ACPU correspond to the real preset state of the virtual brain (decoding accuracy), whether the stimulus of the ACPU decision actually makes the virtual brain evolve towards the target state (control effectiveness), and so on. In terms of visualization, we will develop interactive dashboards that visualize the changes in each key quantity in the closed-loop process: the activity heat map of the virtual brain model, the curve of semantic variables over time, the option evaluation score for each round of decision-making, etc. These interfaces allow researchers to gain insight into system behavior and facilitate the tuning of algorithms and parameters.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Scenario and Case Library: We plan to design a series of representative simulation scenarios (use cases) to form a case library</strong> to cover as many situations as possible. For example, these include \"escalating anxiety situations\", \"sudden panic situations\", \"abnormal situations with incorrect decoding\", \"multi-objective conflict situations\", etc. Each scenario is preset with a different initial state of the virtual brain and external stimuli, and the system is allowed to run in it, testing its robustness and adaptability. By running a large number of simulation experiments, we can count the performance indicators of the system in various scenarios and find possible problems under extreme conditions. For example, if the system does not respond in a \"sudden panic\" scenario, we need to improve the real-time performance of the decision-making algorithm. If the error correction cannot be made in time in the \"error decoding\" scenario, the sensitivity of metacognitive monitoring needs to be strengthened.</p>\n<p>Taken together, the simulation platform will continue throughout the project, serving as a \"virtual proving ground\" to continuously test and optimize our designs. Before key algorithms are put into animal and human experiments, try to use simulation to find and solve problems to reduce R&amp;D risks and costs. Once the simulation results are satisfactory, we are more confident of success in the real world. At the same time, the empirical output of the simulation itself (such as simulation models and datasets) is also a by-product of the project, which can provide a reference for further research in the academic community.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Interpretability-of-the-model-mechanism\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Interpretability-of-the-model-mechanism\" title=\"Interpretability of the model mechanism\"></a><strong>Interpretability of the model mechanism</strong></h1><p>Explainability is a major feature and necessary requirement of this project. In a complex system that integrates artificial consciousness and closed-loop brain-computer interfaces, ensuring that every step of the decision is transparent and solvable for humans is not only helpful for R&amp;D and debugging, but also a prerequisite for clinical application. We'll start with both model design and tool support to create a self-explanatory system.</p>\n<p><strong>DIKWP Semantic Transparent Design: The DIKWP model naturally has a hierarchical semantic structure, which allows the AI decision-making process to be disassembled into well-known cognitive steps. We will strictly follow the DIKWP architecture inside the ACPU, with clear semantic definitions and mathematical descriptions for each layer of processing. For example: (a) the input and output of the data layer are the raw signal and its simple statistical characteristics; (b) The information layer outputs events or patterns with semantic tags, e.g. \"increased amygdala activation\"; (c) Knowledge level output of awareness of the current situation, e.g. \"stress response may occur due to recall of a traumatic situation\"; (d) Wisdom layer outputs the basis for decision-making, e.g., \"given that the patient is in the early stages of panic, immediate intervention should be made to prevent symptoms from worsening\"; (e) The Purpose layer outputs the final action plan, e.g., \"stimulation of brain region Y with X parameters for 3 seconds\". Each of these intermediate results has a specific meaning, for which we design a formal representation</strong> (e.g. with readable labels or graphical representations) for presentation and review in the HMI. Through this layer of traces, every step of the system's reasoning can be traced back to the source and the reason can be understood. When there is an unexpected outcome, we are able to pinpoint where the problem lies (perceptual error?). Incomplete knowledge base? Improper decision-making rules? ) for targeted optimization.</p>\n<p>\"White Box\" Evaluation Framework: We draw on the white box assessment method proposed by Yucong Duan's team to develop a set of interpretable evaluation indicators output by the artificial consciousness model. For example, for each closed-loop decision, the following assessments: (1) <strong>consistency</strong>: whether the outputs of each layer support each other and are not contradictory (e.g., the information layer detects \"fear\" but the knowledge layer judges \"safety\" inconsistently); (2) <strong>adequacy</strong>: whether the decision makes full use of known knowledge and data, or whether important factors are omitted; (3) <strong>comprehensibility</strong>: whether the explanations given by the system are expressed in concepts that humans can understand; (4) <strong>Necessity</strong>: whether each step of reasoning contributes to the final decision, and whether it can be deleted. Through the analysis of a large number of cases, we can quantify the interpretability of the model and guide improvement. For example, if we find that a layer often outputs internal codes that are difficult for humans to understand, we adjust the representation of that layer to more intuitive semantic notation.</p>\n<p><strong>Real-time visualization and user interaction: We will develop an interpretive interface</strong> for researchers and clinicians to see the internal state of the system in real time. The interface, or \"semantic dashboard\", includes: the raw waveform of the current brain signal and ultrasound images; Textual/graphical descriptions of the output of each layer of the ACPU, such as the currently recognized emotional state, the reason inferred by the system, the stimulus chosen and its intended effect; Confidence indicators, such as decoding confidence, decision confidence, etc. In addition, the interface is interoperable: users can question or adjust assumptions about the output of a layer, such as modifying a hypothesis of the knowledge layer to see how it affects the decision. This human-machine interaction helps to validate the internal mechanisms of the model. For example, doctors can adjust the Purpose goal to see how the system stimulates the regimen and how it is appropriate to determine the sensitivity and rationality of the treatment goal. If the explanation displayed on the interface is contrary to the doctor's professional knowledge, the doctor can intervene in time and pause the automatic mode to avoid potential risks. This transparent presentation and manual correction mechanism greatly enhances the safety and reliability of the system in clinical application.</p>\n<p><strong>Editability of knowledge base and rule base: ACPU depends on certain knowledge rules (especially in the Wisdom and Destination layers). To prevent these rules from becoming the new \"black box\", we will design the knowledge base to be editable modules</strong>. Specifically, the knowledge base will store medical and cognitive knowledge in a structure similar to a knowledge graph or ontology, such as \"hyperventilation can exacerbate panic\" and \"high-frequency stimulation of the amygdala can inhibit its activity\". This knowledge is entered and verified by a team of experts before the system goes live, and can be updated as new clinical discoveries are made. The rule base will also contain reasoning and decision-making rules, such as priority in case of multi-objective conflicts, rules for handling exceptions, etc., which will also be recorded. Our system will provide tools for experts to review and modify this knowledge/rules to suit different patients or applications. Through the intervention of artificial knowledge, combined with the patterns that machines learn from data, we strive to achieve a \"controllable and evolving\" artificial consciousness: one that does not deviate from the common sense of human beings, and can constantly improve itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Continuous model monitoring and learning: During the actual operation of the system, we continuously monitor the quality of its interpretation output. On the one hand, the feedback of doctors and patients on the behavior of the system is collected as an important basis for model adjustment. On the other hand, the correctness and usefulness of the explanations were evaluated by comparing the systematic explanations with the objective results (e.g., the system predicted that the patient's panic was about to occur and whether it actually occurred). If a certain type of explanation is found to be often unreliable, the corresponding part of the model will be analyzed and improved in depth. In addition, we will implement online learning capabilities that allow the model to learn better interpretations from the new data acquired in the run. For example, after multiple patient interactions, the system may learn new patterns of triggers, which can be incorporated into the knowledge base to make subsequent explanations more accurate and comprehensive.</strong></p>\n<p>In summary, this project implements the concept of \"<strong>transparency, comprehensibility and controllability\" in the model mechanism</strong>. Ensure that every step of the AI is meaningful from the design source, and ensure that humans can see and influence AI decisions in real time. This highly explainable AI, combined with brain-computer interfaces, not only facilitates scientific debugging, but more importantly, provides clinicians and patients with a foundation of trust that they can know what machines are doing and why, so they can confidently hand themselves over to system-assisted treatment. This will greatly improve the acceptance and success rate of our system in real-world medical scenarios.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Interface-specification-and-hardware-scalability\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Interface-specification-and-hardware-scalability\" title=\"Interface specification and hardware scalability\"></a><strong>Interface specification and hardware scalability</strong></h1><p>To realize the semantic interaction of closed-loop ultrasound brain-computer interface, in addition to the core algorithm model, this project will also formulate a unified interface specification and pay attention to hardware adaptability to ensure that the system has good scalability and engineering landing potential, especially to adapt to domestic chips and devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Brain-Computer Semantic Protocol Standard: We plan to propose the \"Brain Semantic Communication Protocol (BSCP)\" to unify the definition of the semantic expression of brain signals and the coding format of stimulus instructions. The core of this protocol is to introduce the concepts of semantic tags and semantic metadata into brain-computer interactions. For example, define standard codes for different brain states and cognitive semantics (similar to the event code of EEG atlas</strong>, but rise to the semantic level), such as using &lt;EMOTION:FEAR&gt; to represent fear emotion semantics, and &lt;INTENT:ESCAPE&gt; to represent the purpose semantics, etc.; At the same time, it is stipulated that the stimulus instruction is also accompanied by the target semantic identifier and the effect description, such as STIM[Target=Amygdala, Goal=CALM] indicates that the amygdala is administered to the amygdala for the purpose of calming emotions. The protocol will include a message format (e.g., JSON/XML structure or binary frame format) covering the following fields: timestamp, semantic label set (each DIKWP layer can have separate fields), confidence, priority, data validation, etc. In the decoding direction, the ultrasonic signal is parsed by ACPU and then packaged as a BSCP packet and transmitted to the decision-making module. After the coding direction and decision is made to generate a stimulus protocol, it is also sent to the ultrasound device driver in the form of a BSCP message. The advantage of this design is the decoupling of modules and the unification of standards: brain signals from different sources (not only limited to ultrasound, but also EEG, fNIRS, etc. can also be accessed in the future) can be abstracted into BSCP semantic output; Different types of stimulation devices (ultrasound, electrical stimulation, etc.) can also perform corresponding functions according to the BSCP command field. We will compile detailed protocol specification documents and sample libraries, open them to the community for use and improvement, and promote the evolution of brain-computer interfaces from \"signaling layer protocol\" to \"semantic layer protocol\".</p>\n<p>Software and hardware interfaces and middleware: In order to make the BSCP protocol truly applied to the system, we will develop a set of middleware or APIs to facilitate the call of each module. It includes: <strong>data interface library</strong> (responsible for converting the drive data format of ultrasound equipment to BSCP format and reverse conversion), <strong>network communication module</strong> (supporting local and remote BSCP message transmission, and efficient communication frameworks such as ZeroMQ can be selected), <strong>and parsing library</strong>(The ACPU can quickly parse BSCP packets into internal objects or serialize internal objects into packets.) The middleware will be implemented in a cross-platform language (e.g. C++/Python hybrid) to ensure that it can be used in different runtime environments. For real-time requirements, we will optimize the middleware, such as using shared memory, RingBuffer and other mechanisms to reduce latency and ensure the high speed of closed-loop control.</p>\n<p><strong>Consideration of domestic chip adaptation: China is vigorously developing independent and controllable artificial intelligence chips and brain-computer interface hardware, such as Cambrian NPU, various RISC-V architecture processors, etc. This project attaches great importance to the feasibility of combining technical routes with domestic hardware. When designing the ACPU algorithm, we will consider its computing power requirements and parallelization characteristics, and try to make use of the characteristics of domestic AI chips. For example, for deep learning inference, model optimization (cropping and quantization) and inference framework adaptation can be performed for Cambrian MLU and Huawei's Ascend NPU. For symbolic inference, the RISC-V architecture's open instruction set expansion capability can be used to design customized instructions to improve the efficiency of logical inference. For the ultrasonic signal processing part, it can be combined with domestic DSP or FPGA to achieve high-speed filtering, feature extraction, etc. In addition, we will pay attention to the implementation of the DIKWP theory at the hardware level. The research of Yucong Duan's team has proposed a DIKWP-oriented computer architecture design, in which each semantic layer is mapped to dedicated processing units, such as DPU, IPU, KPU, etc. This implies that we can implement a modular architecture on the chip that corresponds to the DIKWP model to accelerate the artificial consciousness algorithm from the hardware layer. For example, in the future, DIKWP chips can be developed</strong>, which integrate data stream processing accelerators, knowledge storage units, Purpose decision logic, etc., to support semantic layer operations. This project will maintain communication with relevant chip R&amp;D teams to explore the possibility of building ACPU prototypes on existing FPGAs or SoCs. If conditions permit, we plan to transplant the core algorithm of ACPU to a domestic embedded board for experimental demonstration in the later stage of the project to verify the performance of the system on low-power and high-integration hardware. This will lay the foundation for subsequent commercialization and clinical application.</p>\n<p><strong>Security and compatibility: Security and standards compatibility should also be considered in the design of interface specifications. For example, we incorporate permissions and encryption mechanisms to prevent unauthorized instruction injection or data eavesdropping.</strong> BSCP messages can be transmitted in conjunction with existing security protocols (e.g., TLS) and authenticated to ensure that medical data and control instructions are not tampered with. In terms of compatibility, we should try to integrate with the existing brain-computer interface communication protocol standards, such as the IEEE's draft brain-computer interface standard, the general interface of the BMI system, etc., and expand the semantic layer content on the basis of it, rather than completely starting from scratch. This will make the results of this project more acceptable and integrated by the industry. At the same time, we will provide different complexity versions of the protocol: for example, a lite version for compute and bandwidth-constrained chips, and an extended version for feature-rich servers. This hierarchical design allows the protocol to be backward compatible according to the application.</p>\n<p>By formulating a unified interface protocol and focusing on the adaptation and optimization of domestic hardware, we hope to ensure that the results of this project are not only a laboratory prototype, but also standardized, modular, and easy to promote. In this way, after the completion of the project, our technology can be integrated into the national new generation of brain-computer interface industry chain more quickly, and combined with domestic equipment to form a complete independent and controllable solution. This is of great significance to seize the commanding heights of the formulation of international brain-computer interface standards and ensure the safety and controllability of relevant technologies in China.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Risk-assessment-and-risk-response\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Risk-assessment-and-risk-response\" title=\"Risk assessment and risk response\"></a><strong>Risk assessment and risk response</strong></h1><p>In view of the cutting-edge and complex nature of this project, we have identified the following key risk points and developed corresponding prevention and response measures to ensure the smooth achievement of the project objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Risk 1: Ultrasound Signal Quality and Safety Risks</strong> – <em>Description</em>: The penetration and reflection characteristics of brain tissue to ultrasound are complex, and the high attenuation of the skull may lead to insufficient imaging signal quality and affect the decoding accuracy. At the same time, there are potential safety concerns due to the prolonged effect of ultrasound, such as excessive power that may cause tissue heating or microbubble damage. <em>Response</em>: (1) At the signal level, optimize the ultrasound imaging parameters (frequency, emission angle, etc.) and use signal enhancement algorithms (such as image reconstruction, denoising and template matching) to improve the signal-to-noise ratio; If necessary, consider multimodal fusion, such as in combination with EEG to assist in correcting the ultrasound signal. (2) In terms of safety, strictly abide by international ultrasound safety standards (such as mechanical index MI and temperature rise index TI limits), continuously monitor the temperature and structural changes of the affected tissues in animal experiments, and adjust the strategy immediately if there is an abnormality. The safety monitoring module is introduced to calculate the cumulative ultrasonic dose and estimated temperature rise in real time, and the safety threshold is included in the ACPU decision-making constraints. Long-term continuous stimulation is replaced by a low-dose and multi-frequency stimulation regimen to reduce the energy accumulation of a single session. At the same time, the project will work with medical imaging experts to evaluate the possible biological effects of ultrasound and control the safety red line.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Risk 2: Insufficient accuracy of brain semantic decoding</strong> – <em>Explanation</em>: The decoding of high-level semantic states of the brain (such as emotion, purpose) is a very challenging problem in the field of AI, and individual differences and environmental noise may lead to insufficient accuracy of the decoding model and misjudgment. If the ACPU incorrectly interprets the normal state as abnormal, it will cause unnecessary irritation. <em>Response</em>: (1) Increase the diversity and quantity of training data: In the algorithm development stage, collect as much as possible data on the semantic correspondence of brain signals and behaviors, including different individuals, different situations, and different emotional levels, so as to improve the generalization ability of the model. (2) Adopt active learning strategy: In the actual use of the system, the decoding model is constantly adjusted according to the doctor's feedback and the patient's subjective report. (3) Set up multi-layer redundancy check: The hierarchical structure of the DIKWP model is used to cross-verify the reliability of the results, for example, multiple independent features of the information layer need to point to the same emotional conclusion to trigger the judgment of the knowledge layer; Before making a decision at the Wisdom layer, the metacognitive module checks the support of the low-level evidence, and if the evidence is insufficient, it postpones the decision to request more data. (4) Allow manual intervention: In closed-loop clinical applications, human safety officers (such as clinicians) are introduced to monitor the decoding results in real time, and when the system interprets the semantics that are obviously inconsistent with the actual situation (the doctor can observe and verify from the patient's performance), he has the right to suspend or correct the system decoding to avoid false stimulation. Through the above measures, the false positive rate is reduced to an acceptable range as much as possible, and even if a false positive is made, it will not directly harm the patient.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Risk 3: Closed-loop control is unstable or deviates from expectations</strong> – <em>Description</em>: Adaptive closed-loop systems may exhibit unexpected dynamic behaviors, such as oscillations, divergence, or falling into a local suboptimal state, leading to regulatory failure or even worsening of patient status. This can be caused by inaccurate models, excessive time delays, poorly designed control strategies, etc. <em>Solution</em>: (1) Strict control theory analysis: When designing stimulus control strategies, control theory experts are introduced to analyze the stability of the closed-loop system, including establishing a mathematical model to solve the closed-loop characteristic equation and analyzing the influence of parameters on stability. Make sure that the control gain and feedback mechanism chosen will allow the system to converge. If necessary, a conservative progressive control strategy can be used, such as observing feedback with only a small stimulus for the first time, and gradually approaching the target. (2) Implement real-time monitoring and oscillation detection: The ACPU metacognitive module monitors the closed-loop behavior pattern, and if it detects repeated fluctuations up and down in the same state (oscillation signs) or the error does not decrease but rises (divergence signs), it will trigger a safe shutdown or switch to manual control, and mark the problem for post-event analysis and improvement. (3) In the simulation and animal experiment stages, the dynamic response of the closed-loop under different model parameters is extensively tested, and the algorithm is adjusted to enhance the robustness of the system to uncertainty. For example, the introduction of adaptive gain or fuzzy control methods allows the control force to be adjusted with the error and rate of change to prevent overshoot and back-and-forth oscillation. (4) Preset emergency exit mechanism: If the system fails to converge to a reasonable range within a certain period of time (such as more than double the expected control time), it will automatically stop the current closed-loop process, issue an alert and wait for manual decision. Through the above means, the closed-loop control process is stable and reliable, and the risk of deviation is reduced.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Risk 4: ACPU implementation complexity and performance bottlenecks</strong> – <em>Description</em>: ACPU needs to perform a large number of calculations, such as deep learning inference, symbolic reasoning, and real-time control decisions, and may face performance bottlenecks, resulting in real-time operation. At the same time, its development complexity is high, and multi-module collaboration is prone to bugs. <em>Response</em>: (1) In terms of architecture, adopt modular and parallel design. Take full advantage of multi-core CPU and GPU parallelism, process decoding, decision-making pipelines in parallel, and use FPGA/ASIC to accelerate critical parts when necessary. The computing power requirements of each module are evaluated in advance, and the algorithm is optimized to an acceptable complexity. For example, compressing depth models, employing heuristic rules to reduce search space, and so on. (2) Strengthen software engineering management: strict version control, equal emphasis on module unit testing and integration testing, formal verification of key algorithms and interface designs, and reduce logical loopholes. (3) Formulate a downgrade strategy: In special cases, if the ACPU calculation is too slow or error, you can switch to simplified mode. For example, only some key layers of inference are performed, or a preset fixed stimulation program can be enabled to ensure that the basic functions of the system are not interrupted. (4) Synchronization with hardware R&amp;D: Once the software prototype verification is successful, we will start the adaptation with domestic chips as soon as possible, and offload part of the computing to special hardware to improve the speed. At the same time, we should consider algorithm alternatives when resources are limited, such as replacing deep networks with shallow networks on embedded platforms. Through both technology and management, we ensure that the ACPU is controllable, measurable, and operates reliably within the required performance range.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Risk 5: Clinical Translation and Ethical Risks</strong> – <em>Description</em>: Although technically feasible, actual clinical application may still encounter risks such as personnel cooperation, ethical approval, policies and regulations, etc. For example, patients and doctors have trust in \"artificial awareness\" interventions, ethics committees have safety concerns about adaptive AI decision-making, and medical device regulatory authorities have requirements for algorithm transparency and controllability. <em>Response</em>: (1) Strengthen multidisciplinary cooperation: Clinicians and ethicists are invited to participate in the project process to guide and evaluate the program to ensure that the design is in line with ethics and clinical norms. For example, an independent ethics monitoring team should be established to review experimental protocols, human-computer interfaces, privacy protection, etc. (2) Improve system controllability and transparency: As mentioned above, we provide a human monitoring interface and detailed explanations, which will enhance clinical trust in the system. At the same time, do a good job of informed communication with patients, explain the working principle and safety guarantee of the system in plain language, and let patients voluntarily participate and feedback their experience. (3) In the clinical trial stage, start from low-risk groups and adjuvant treatments. For example, it should be used first in severe patients (if other methods are ineffective), as an adjunct rather than the only means, to gradually accumulate safety data. When approved by regulatory agencies, detailed test reports and source code audits can be provided to prove that the system behavior is predictable and the risks are controllable. (4) Pay attention to the dynamics of laws and regulations: track domestic and foreign policies on AI medical and brain-computer interfaces, and lay out the necessary registration and certification processes in advance to ensure that the project results are promoted under the premise of compliance. Through these measures, we are confident that we can reduce the risk to a reasonable level and enable the innovative technology to move responsibly to the clinic.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, we have made a comprehensive review of the potential risks of the project and formulated a thorough response plan. During the implementation of the project, the risk assessment will be reviewed regularly, and the countermeasures will be adjusted and refined according to the actual progress. Through proactive risk management, projects are completed on schedule and with high quality to the greatest extent.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Expected-Outcomes-and-Appraisal-Indicators\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Expected-Outcomes-and-Appraisal-Indicators\" title=\"Expected Outcomes and Appraisal Indicators\"></a><strong>Expected Outcomes and Appraisal Indicators</strong></h1><p>After the completion of this project, it is expected that a series of important achievements will be achieved in theoretical innovation, technological breakthrough and application demonstration.

Among them, the quantitative indicators strive to be clear, specific and measurable; Qualitative indicators are judged by expert review and material review. We will establish a data collection and validation methodology for each metric to ensure that the final project outcome stands up to scrutiny. For example, keep all the original experimental records for verification, establish a patient follow-up mechanism to evaluate the sustainability of efficacy, etc. By achieving the above results, the project will not only make a breakthrough in science, but also produce prototypes of technologies and products with practical application prospects, and promote the development of related industries.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Clinical-demonstration-application-pathway\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Clinical-demonstration-application-pathway\" title=\"Clinical demonstration application pathway\"></a><strong>Clinical demonstration application pathway</strong></h1><p>The ultimate goal of this project is to realize the transformation from laboratory results to clinical practice. We have planned a step-by-step clinical demonstration path to ensure that the new technology is safely and effectively applied to the target population and lay the foundation for large-scale rollout.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1: Simulated Clinical Scenario Validation (Year 3-4)</strong> – Build a near-real clinical scenario in the laboratory and test the system end-to-end. For example, simulating a psychiatric ward or psychotherapy room environment, having volunteers wearing ultrasound probes (healthy simulated patients) interact with clinicians, and the system monitors their mood changes in real time and gives appropriate interventions. Through this scenario exercise, the shortcomings of the system in the human-computer interaction process are found, such as patient cooperation, doctor operation interface friendliness, etc. Improve the design based on feedback in a timely manner to ensure that the system process is in line with clinical practice. For example, if a patient is found to be unable to sit still with ultrasound when anxious is intense, we may need to develop a portable wearable ultrasound device that allows the patient to move freely; If doctors want more manual control options, we can add manual mode capabilities, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2: Small Sample Clinical Trial Study (Year 4-5)</strong> – 10-20 eligible patients with anxiety disorder or PTSD are selected for a single-arm initial clinical trial following ethical approval and regulatory filing. The location is available at the mental health center of the partner hospital. Each patient receives a multi-week system adjuvant therapy: conventional psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy plus our closed-loop ultrasound intervention. Detailed data were recorded, including brain signals, system decisions, stimulation parameters, as well as patients' subjective feelings and doctors' observation records during each session. The changes in the patients' symptom scale were evaluated before and after treatment and at follow-up, and the differences before and after the intervention were compared. If possible, introduce a control group (e.g., psychotherapy only) for comparison. The goal is to verify the safety of the system, patient tolerability, and trends in symptomatic improvement. If the results are positive (the rate of symptom improvement is significantly higher than that of the control), it can provide a basis for the next step of larger-scale validation; If the results are not satisfactory, you can also analyze the reasons such as the need to improve the algorithm or the need to limit the subtype for patient screening, etc., and try again after the system is upgraded.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 3: Expansion of Strategic Collaboration and Multi-center Trial (Post-5 Phase)</strong> – After the formal phase of the project, we plan to move forward to Phase II/III clinical trials, which will require more units and larger samples. To this end, we will actively strive for follow-up scientific research or industrial transformation funds, and work with medical device companies, hospitals and regulatory agencies to carry out multi-center clinical trials. The psychiatric departments of 3-5 tertiary hospitals across the country were selected, led by experts who had participated in the project, and the improved and mature system was used in a controlled trial of more than 100 patients, and the efficacy and safety were strictly evaluated. If the trial is successful, we will cooperate with the application for special approval of innovative medical devices by the State Food and Drug Administration, and strive to make the product enter clinical use as soon as possible. At the same time, explore the application expansion: in addition to anxiety/PTSD, this system may be useful for patients with other brain diseases, such as depression (regulating emotional brain regions), addiction disorders (regulating reward circuits), etc., and can be piloted in a small area to summarize the efficacy. In terms of technology promotion, we have cooperated with local hospitals to establish demonstration centers, train clinical personnel to use the system, collect data on the effects of the system in different regions, and continuously optimize the system algorithm and use specifications.</p>\n<p><strong>Vision: If the above steps are successfully completed, we are expected to achieve the clinical transformation of this semantic closed-loop ultrasound brain-computer interface system within 5-8 years. At that time, patients with anxiety or PTSD may use this system as a routine adjunctive treatment in hospital or community care. For example, a typical scenario is for a patient to wear a specially designed ultrasound brain-computer interface headset connected to a portable device with a built-in ACPU. Under the guidance of a psychotherapist, if the patient has a strong stress response, the device will automatically detect and administer gentle ultrasound stimulation, and the patient's excessive tension will be quickly relieved, so as to better cooperate with the treatment. This immediate, individualized approach to intervention is expected to significantly improve treatment outcomes and patients' quality of life. From a broader perspective, the success of this system will prove the feasibility of this new paradigm of brain semantic interaction, provide valuable experience for the future development of a wider range</strong> of purpose-driven brain-computer interfaces (such as consciousness arousal in patients with impaired consciousness, motor purpose decoding in stroke patients, etc.), and promote the development of the integration of brain science and artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Of course, in the process of moving towards clinical application, we will continue to pay attention to and abide by ethical and legal guidelines, respect the privacy and wishes of patients, and ensure that the technology is used wisely and not abused. Maintain communication with regulatory authorities and provide project data in a timely manner to facilitate the introduction of a reasonable regulatory framework to regulate the use of such AI brain-computer interface products. We believe that through a robust and far-sighted clinical transformation path, the results of this project will not only stay in papers and laboratories, but truly enter medical practice, bring good news to the majority of patients, and promote the innovation and upgrading of China's brain-computer interface industry and medical technology.</p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#conclusion\" title=\"conclusion\"></a><strong>conclusion</strong></h1><p>This project is oriented to the cutting-edge research needs of high-spatiotemporal resolution ultrasound brain-computer interface, and takes <strong>the DIKWP artificial consciousness model proposed by Professor Yucong Duan as the theoretical cornerstone, and innovatively applies it to the closed-loop brain-computer interface system.

Finally, the application of the system verifies the intervention value of the system for typical mental illnesses, and brings new ideas for clinical treatment. It is foreseeable that the success of this project will enable China to take a leading position in the emerging frontier field of semantic brain-computer interaction, accelerate the paradigm shift from \"signal interaction\" to \"semantic interaction\", and lay a milestone foundation for the realization of a new generation of highly intelligent and human-oriented brain-computer interface.</p>\n<p>In summary, this project focuses on the high spatiotemporal resolution ultrasound brain-computer interface, integrates the DIKWP model of artificial consciousness, and advances with the methodology of systems engineering.

Background\"></a><strong>1. Background</strong></h1><p>In recent years, the deep integration of neuroscience and artificial intelligence has promoted the revolutionary upgrade of brain-computer interface technology. \"Neuromodulation and brain-computer closed-loop interaction technology\" has been listed as one of the important strategic directions of the future industry by the state. This project focuses on the treatment needs of closed-loop brain-computer interfaces for typical neurological diseases (such as Parkinson's disease, depression, etc.) and the application of intelligent rehabilitation. For example, the Adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) system developed by Medtronic has been approved by the FDA to automatically adjust stimulation parameters based on the patient's real-time brain activity; For treatment-resistant depression, personalized closed-loop brain stimulation therapy has shown rapid and lasting symptom improvement in case studies. However, most of the existing closed-loop neuromodulation systems are based on the threshold feedback of a single physiological signal, lacking a deep understanding of the multimodal state and subjective purpose of patients, and the intelligent regulation strategy is relatively shallow, making it difficult to adapt to the complex and changeable brain state in time.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the field of artificial intelligence is undergoing a paradigm shift from traditional \"data-driven\" to \"intelligent self-knowledge\". The Chinese research team took the lead in proposing the \"Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom-Purpose\" (DIKWP) artificial consciousness model, which adds a \"Purpose/Purpose\" layer on the basis of the classic DIKW framework to realize semantic collaboration and two-way feedback between various cognitive levels through a network structure, thus providing an innovative path for solving the \"black box\" problem of current AI models and improving the interpretability and controllability of AI decision-making process. This new cognitive system is an academic milestone and is regarded as an important \"underlying code\" to lead the safe, controllable, and explainable development of AI in the future, providing solid support for the move towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). Professor Yucong Duan, who proposed the model, has been authorized 114 invention patents, and the related core technical achievements have attracted worldwide attention. These preliminary accumulations have laid the foundation for the integration of artificial consciousness principles and brain-computer interface technology, and also provided strong support for the implementation of this project.</p>\n<p>Based on the above background, this project is oriented to the guidance direction of the National Science and Technology Major Project \"Research on Neuromodulation and Brain-Computer Closed-loop Interaction Technology\", and proposes to construct a set of artificial consciousness neural interface system (DIKWP-NIS) with the closed-loop architecture of \"multimodal perception-purpose generation-neuromodulation\" as the core. The system will integrate the semantic perception and processing of multimodal information such as vision, hearing, touch, and proprioception, and use the \"Purpose (Purpose) layer\" of the DIKWP model as the center to generate meaningful regulatory targets for users, and use the Artificial Consciousness Processing Unit ([ACPU) to generate meaningful regulatory targets]{.underline} Realize adaptive and personalized control of neurostimulation devices. The project aims to break through the limitations of traditional brain-computer interfaces in passive response to a single signal, and develop a new paradigm of closed-loop regulation with autonomous cognitive ability, which can optimize and dynamically adjust stimulus parameters for scenarios such as Parkinson's disease tremor control and depression relief. While realizing the innovation of precision treatment and rehabilitation aids for major diseases, this project will explore a new model of brain-computer interaction in the 6G era, and play a leading role in the development of domestic autonomous neuromodulation chips and software platforms.</p>\n<h1 id=\"2-Theoretical-basis\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-Theoretical-basis\" title=\"2. Theoretical basis\"></a><strong>2. Theoretical basis</strong></h1><p><strong>DIKWP Artificial Consciousness Model and Purpose Generation Principle:</strong> The DIKWP model abstracts the human cognitive process into five progressive elements: Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom, and Purpose. The model emphasizes the introduction of \"purpose\" driving in the process of intelligence generation from low to high: that is, the processing of each layer to the previous layer is guided by the main goal, so as to form a closed-loop cognitive architecture with autonomous purpose. Different from the traditional AI framework that only processes data-information-knowledge, the DIKWP model realizes the understanding and internalization of human purposes by machine intelligence by embedding the key high-order semantic layer of \"Purpose\", enabling AI systems to make autonomous decisions based on the goals given by humans. This opens up the possibility of establishing a common \"cognitive language\" between humans and machines, making every decision made by AI traceable and interpretable, and ensuring that its actions always serve human values and safety needs. From the perspective of consciousness science, the DIKWP model is in line with mainstream consciousness theories such as Global Workspace Theory (GWT) and Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which emphasizes the regulatory role of global purpose in decentralized information processing, and provides a feasible path for artificial systems to simulate the generation and self-regulation of purpose similar to human consciousness.</p>\n<p><strong>ACPU Architecture and Interpretable Neural Modulation Operating System:</strong> In order to realize the artificial consciousness function of the DIKWP model in engineering, the Artificial Consciousness Processing Unit (ACPU) architecture is introduced in this project. ACPU can be regarded as a combination of dedicated intelligent processor and operating system that integrates cognitive computing and neural regulation, and its core is an interpretable, adaptive, and self-regulating neuromodulation \"consciousness operating system\". The system draws on the concept of \"semantic operating system\" proposed by Professor Yucong Duan's team, and decomposes the complex decision-making process into five monitorable links according to the DIKWP framework: data, information, knowledge, wisdom, and purpose. Each link has a well-defined semantic state and algorithmic logic to ensure that the entire process from perceptual input to stimulus output is under intelligible and intervenable control. Specifically, the ACPU architecture includes: a multimodal semantic perception module (responsible for converting various signals from the brain-computer-body into DIKWP structured semantic representations); P-layer Purpose decision-making module (simulates the execution center functions of the prefrontal lobe of the brain, and generates the regulatory purpose of the current moment according to the perceptual semantics and built-in goals); and the Neuromodulation Execution Module, which includes semantic stimulus coding and [neurotransmitter regulation models described below]{.underline}, translating Purpose into specific neurostimulation parameters. Through this modular architecture, ACPU is able to adaptively adjust strategies for different patients and situations, enabling closed-loop optimal control of neurostimulation devices. In addition, due to the transparent and traceable decision-making link, the operating system is easy to integrate clinical knowledge and safety constraints, making the regulatory decision-making of Parkinson's disease, depression and other diseases both efficient and in line with medical norms.</p>\n<p><strong>Semantic Stimulus Coding and Neurotransmitter Regulation Modeling:</strong> How to map high-level Purpose to low-level bioelectric/chemical stimuli in neuromodulation circuits is a core scientific question. In this project, we propose a mechanism of \"semantic stimulus coding\", which translates the regulatory purpose generated by the P layer into the corresponding neurostimulation mode based on the DIKWP semantic space. For example, when the Purpose is \"Tremor Relief\", the system will select an electrical stimulation parameter mode that adjusts the excitability of a specific neural circuit based on this semantic goal; When the Purpose is \"improving mood\", a magnetic stimulation sequence that affects the reward/emotion circuitry in the brain or a chemical transmitter release regimen that targets a specific neural nucleus may be employed. To this end, we will construct a mapping relationship library between DIKWP semantics and neurophysiological parameters, and train it through machine learning combined with brain science knowledge. Furthermore, the project proposes a joint modeling of \"semantic neurotransmitter regulation\": considering that neurotransmitters are the internal mediators of the brain to achieve higher-order semantic functions such as emotion and motivation, we will establish a correlation model between different semantic states and the activities of specific neurotransmitter systems. For example, elevated dopamine levels usually correspond to increased motivation and reward expectations, and \"purpose\"-related volitional behaviors often involve regulation of the midbrain-limbic dopamine pathway; The release of serotonin is closely related to mood stability and depression relief. Through literature research and experimental data analysis, we will map semantic factors (such as \"concentration\", \"pleasure\", \"nervousness\", etc.) and key neurotransmitters (such as dopamine, 5-HT, norepinephrine, etc.) under the DIKWP framework, as an important basis for designing intervention strategies. This semantic-neurotransmitter mapping structure will support the system in selecting the most effective biological intervention pathway according to P-layer targets (e.g., locating specific brain regions to induce the release of desired transmitters) to achieve precise regulation based on individual differences.</p>\n<p><strong>[Purpose-transmitter resonance model]{.underline}</strong> <strong>and closed-loop regulation strategy:</strong> In order to achieve precise control of the dynamic brain, this project introduces the \"purpose-transmitter resonance\" theoretical model. The model assumes that in the closed loop of the artificial consciousness system (ACPU) and the biological brain, there is an optimal matching point for the user's purpose state and the brain's neurochemical state to reinforce each other—that is, the \"resonant\" state. When the P-layer purpose and the corresponding neurotransmitter activity rhythm in the user's brain reach a coordinated resonance, the regulatory effect will be most significant and stable. Accordingly, we will refer to the adaptive oscillator model in control theory to establish a coupling equation between the purpose signal and the concentration of neurotransmitters and the excitability of the brain network, and analyze the resonance characteristics of the brain network in different purpose modes. The model will be used to guide the design of a closed-loop control strategy: that is, the ACPU continuously adjusts the stimulation parameters to approximate the Purpose-transmitter resonance condition according to the monitored brain feedback, so as to achieve dynamic optimization of regulatory efficiency. When the user's state changes, such as mood fluctuations or sports purpose changes, the system can predict new resonance points through the model and quickly adjust the parameters to ensure that the closed-loop adjustment always resonates with the user's internal needs. The introduction of the Purpose - Transmitter resonance model has improved our closed-loop system from simple passive feedback control to model-driven active predictive control, which greatly improves the response speed and stability of the system in complex environments.</p>\n<h1 id=\"3-the-overall-goal-and-innovation-points\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-the-overall-goal-and-innovation-points\" title=\"3. the overall goal and innovation points\"></a><strong>3. the overall goal and innovation points</strong></h1><p><strong>Overall Objective:</strong> This project aims to develop a multimodal closed-loop brain-computer interaction system (DIKWP-NIS) based on the DIKWP artificial consciousness model, and realize the precise and adaptive regulation of the nervous system by introducing the semantic understanding and purpose decision-making mechanism of artificial consciousness. The specific objectives include: 1) constructing a multimodal brain-machine-body integrated semantic perception and purpose generation mechanism, so that the system can integrate and process multi-source inputs such as vision, hearing, touch, and electromyography, and extract the high-level semantic state related to the user's current goal; 2) Design a neuromodulation operating system under the architecture of the Artificial Consciousness Processing Unit (ACPU) to realize the self-optimization and closed-loop regulation of stimulus parameters for typical neurological diseases such as Parkinson's and depression, so as to ensure that the system decision-making process is explainable, intervenable, safe and reliable; 3) Establish a joint modeling method of \"semantic stimulus coding\" and \"neurotransmitter regulation\", explore the mapping relationship from semantic goals to specific electrical/magnetic/chemical stimuli, and develop individual-oriented precise neuromodulation strategies; 4) The theory of \"Purpose-transmitter resonance\" was proposed, and a closed-loop control algorithm based on model prediction was developed to achieve real-time tracking and optimal regulation of dynamic brain states. 5) Develop a variety of application prototypes, including brain-controlled rehabilitation training system, artificial consciousness assisted sensory compensation system, multimodal brain stimulation platform for cognitive impairment, etc., to verify the versatility and effectiveness of the technology of this project.</p>\n<p><strong>Innovation:</strong> This project has obvious innovations in the following aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>*Innovation 1: Multimodal semantic collaboration and purpose-driven closed-loop architecture. *Breaking the traditional brain-computer interface model that relies on a single signal, the DIKWP artificial consciousness model is introduced for the first time to realize the semantic integration of multimodal information such as vision, hearing, and somatosensory, and the \"Purpose\" layer is used as the center to make decisions and control neurostimulation, so as to build a semantic closed-loop interaction of the \"brain-machine-body\" trinity.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>*Innovation 2: ACPU Artificial Consciousness Neuromodulation Operating System. *This paper proposes an artificial consciousness processing unit architecture for brain-computer closed-loop applications, and designs a dedicated operating system kernel with interpretability and autonomous adaptability. The OS can adjust stimulation parameters in real time according to the patient's status and make the AI decision-making process transparent to meet the needs of medical safety and personalized treatment, which is a paradigm upgrade of traditional neuromodulation devices.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>*Innovation 3: Joint modeling of \"semantic stimulus coding\" and \"neurotransmitter regulation\". *He pioneered the mapping of semantic information and neuromodulation parameters, and proposed a dual modeling method that considers both external stimulus patterns and internal neurotransmitter environments. Through semantic-guided neurostimulation coding and the regulation of intrinsic chemical signals in the brain, this project is expected to achieve more refined and humanized interventions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>*Innovation 4: Closed-loop regulatory strategy of \"Purpose-transmitter resonance\". *A new strategy combining control theory and brain science is proposed: to find the resonance conditions between artificial purpose and brain transmitter activity through model simulation, and to guide stimulus regulation. This strategy is different from the traditional passive feedback control, but actively predicts and induces the system to enter the optimal resonance state, which significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of closed-loop control.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>*Innovation 5: A universal artificial consciousness neural interface platform across diseases and scenarios. *The results of the project will be verified in a number of typical scenarios in the form of a prototype system, including brain-like intelligent rehabilitation training, sensory impairment assistance, and closed-loop regulation of cognitive impairment, reflecting the general scalability of the technology. This cross-domain application capability stems from the general architecture of artificial consciousness that we introduced, which lays the foundation for expanding to more human-computer interaction scenarios (such as intelligent education and training, human-machine collaboration, and assisted driving brain control) in the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>*Innovation 6: Forward-looking layout for 6G communication and domestic ecology. *The project closely connects with the new requirements of the ultra-high-speed and low-latency network environment for brain-computer interface in the future 6G era, and reserves a cloud collaboration interface and a secure encryption channel in the system design to support the efficient transmission and remote control of brain-computer data. At the same time, priority will be given to the use of domestically developed chips and software platforms (including customized neuromodulation SoCs and real-time operating systems) to create an independent and controllable artificial consciousness brain-computer interface technology chain to help enhance China's international competitiveness in this field.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"4-the-technical-route\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-the-technical-route\" title=\"4. the technical route\"></a><strong>4. the technical route</strong></h1><p><img alt=\"图片描述\" src=\"/cooperation/items/media/image1.png\" style=\"width:60%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;\"/><br/><em>Figure 1: The overall architecture of the DIKWP-NIS artificial consciousness neural interface system is shown Purpose. The system takes multi-modal semantic perception and purpose decision-making as the closed-loop center, realizes the adaptive control of the stimulation device through the ACPU operating system, and forms a closed-loop regulation link from environmental/physical signals to neurostimulation to physiological feedback.</em></p>\n<p>Figure 1 shows the overall architecture of the DIKWP-NIS system to be developed in this project. The input of the system comes from the multimodal semantic perception module, which integrates various signals from the external environment and the user's body (such as camera field of view, microphone sound, tactile sensor, EEG/EMG signal, physiological parameters, etc.), and converts these raw data into structured semantic representations in the DIKWP model (corresponding to D, I, K, W levels) through semantic co-processing. On this basis, the P-layer <strong>Purpose Generation Module</strong> is entered, which is equivalent to the brain center of artificial consciousness, and combines the current contextual semantics and the system's built-in objective functions (such as mitigation goals for specific symptoms) to generate Purpose decisions for the next step of neural regulation. P-layer purpose can be derived from the understanding of the user's brain state (e.g., detected motor purpose or emotional demand), or it can be initiated by the system (e.g., guiding the user towards a training goal based on a rehabilitation strategy).</p>\n<p>The Purpose decision is then passed on to the Neural Modulation Operating System kernel based on the ACPU architecture. The kernel contains two key functional modules: one is the semantic stimulus coding module, which selects or generates the corresponding stimulus parameter sequences (such as electrode combination, pulse frequency/intensity mode of electrical stimulation, coil position and frequency of magnetic stimulation) from the pre-established semantic-stimulus mapping library according to the P-layer purpose, so as to realize the translation of high-level semantic targets to low-level neurostimulation instructions; The second is the neurotransmitter modulation module, which is used to predict and evaluate the impact of the current purpose and stimulation regimen on the user's neurotransmitter level and overall brain network status, and can adjust the stimulation regimen if needed to maintain homeostasis or avoid side effects. The two modules work together under the scheduling of the ACPU operating system to continuously iteratively optimize the stimulus output. The generated stimulus control instructions are sent to a stimulation actuator, which can be an implanted deep brain electrode, a transcranial magnetic stimulation coil, a surface electrical stimulation electrode, or a future minimally invasive neurotransmitter release device. The stimulation actuator acts on the corresponding area of the patient's brain according to the instructions to implement physical or chemical regulatory interventions.</p>\n<p>At the other end of the closed loop, the patient's brain and body respond to stimuli, and this response is transmitted back to the system input through a multi-source feedback pathway. Feedback signals include neurophysiological signals (such as EEG, local field potentials and other indicators that reflect the state of the brain), muscle movement or behavior performance (detected by wearable sensors), autonomic responses (heart rate, skin electroderm, etc.), and patients' subjective feelings and reports (obtained through human-computer interaction interfaces). The multi-source feedback is processed by the semantic perception module and upgraded to a high-level semantic representation, which is used by the P-layer Purpose module to evaluate the current regulation effect and decide the subsequent Purpose update. In this way, a closed-loop loop of \"perception-purpose-stimulus-feedback\" is formed: the system continuously adjusts the semantic understanding and regulation strategies of the environment and users according to the feedback, so that the whole interaction process has adaptive learning ability.</p>\n<p>The above technical route can be summarized as the following implementation steps: firstly, through the collection and annotation of brain-computer-body multimodal data, the knowledge base and semantic parsing algorithm supported by the DIKWP model are established to ensure that the system can accurately \"read\" the user state and environmental information; Secondly, the Purpose reasoning engine was developed, which draws on cognitive reasoning and reinforcement learning methods, so that the system can make regulatory decisions that meet the long-term interests of users in complex situations. Thirdly, the stimulus coding and transmitter regulation algorithm were designed and optimized, and the model parameters were adjusted through biofeedback experiments to form an optimal stimulus output strategy driven by artificial consciousness. Fourth, develop ACPU software and supporting hardware prototypes to open up real-time communication in sensing, computing and stimulation to achieve closed-loop system integration; Finally, the effectiveness and safety of closed-loop control are verified through the simulation platform and some function demonstrations, and the performance of each module is gradually iteratively improved on this basis. The above route will be closely coordinated by theoretical research, algorithm development, prototype implementation and experimental verification to ensure the smooth realization of the project goals.</p>\n<h1 id=\"5-Task-decomposition\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#5-Task-decomposition\" title=\"5. Task decomposition\"></a><strong>5. Task decomposition</strong></h1><p>In order to achieve the above objectives, the research content of the project is divided into the following six interrelated tasks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Research on DIKWP Multimodal Semantic Perception and Purpose Generation Mechanism</strong>: Build a multi-channel data collection and annotation platform covering vision, hearing, touch, physiological signals, etc., and study the semantic representation methods and fusion algorithms of each modal information. A semantic parsing engine was developed based on the DIKWP model to realize entity recognition, event extraction, and context understanding of multi-source data. On this basis, a P-layer Purpose generation algorithm is developed to explore a computational model for inferring the user's Purpose/Target from the multimodal semantic state, solve the problem of Purpose recognition and uncertainty processing under noise interference, and form a mechanism prototype of brain-machine-body semantic collaboration.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>ACPU architecture and neuromodulation operating system development</strong>: Design the system architecture of the Artificial Consciousness Processing Unit (ACPU), including software and hardware interface specifications, key module function definitions, and runtime scheduling mechanisms. Based on this architecture, an interpretable neural regulation operating system kernel is developed to realize the mapping and coordination of the processing processes of each layer of the DIKWP model in the system. Key research: multi-task real-time scheduling strategy to ensure low-latency response in the closed-loop of perception-decision-stimulation; The visual monitoring tool of the decision-making process realizes the transparency and traceability of the AI decision-making link. The safety isolation and emergency intervention mechanism ensures that the system can automatically switch to safe mode or remind manual intervention when abnormal conditions occur.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Semantic stimulus encoding and personalized parameter optimization</strong>: Construct a mapping library from semantic target to stimulus parameters, and preset candidate stimulus regimens (including electrical stimulation waveform parameters, magnetic stimulation protocols, drug doses, etc.) for typical semantic purposes (such as \"reducing tremor amplitude\", \"improving attention\", \"relieving anxiety\", etc.). In this study, the parameter adaptive adjustment method based on reinforcement learning and optimization algorithm is studied, so that the system can continuously fine-tune the stimulation parameters to adapt to individual differences and state changes under closed-loop operation conditions. This task will preliminarily verify the effectiveness of semantic stimulus coding on the in vitro neuronal culture and animal experiment platform, and form a software module for parameter optimization algorithms.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Semantic-neurotransmitter joint regulation model and algorithm:</strong> Carry out research on the mechanism of neurotransmitter monitoring and regulation, select key transmitters closely related to emotion and motivation (such as 5-HT, DA, etc.), and establish a quantitative correlation model between them and brain activity patterns and behavioral indicators. Develop algorithms that can estimate the user's transmitter status in real time (with the help of EEG, brain microdialysis sensing, or metabolic indicators, etc.), and design transmitter regulation strategies (such as indirect transmitter modulation methods such as transcranial electrical/magnetic stimulation). On this basis, a purpose-transmitter resonance control algorithm was proposed to realize the target-guided dynamic adjustment of transmitter level. The algorithm is verified and the parameter sensitivity analysis is carried out by simulation tools such as Matlab/Simulink, which provides theoretical support for closed-loop control.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Prototype system integration and application verification</strong>: The above modules are integrated to build a DIKWP-NIS prototype system, including sensor interface, ACPU main control board, stimulation output interface and host computer monitoring software. The user-friendly interface is designed to allow researchers and clinicians to access the internal status of the system and adjust parameters. The functional test and verification of the prototype system were carried out in typical scenarios, such as the construction of \"brain-controlled rehabilitation training\" experiment (the patient controls the virtual reality training task through the brain-computer interface, and the system adjusts the brain stimulation enhancement training effect in real time), and the \"emotional intervention\" experiment (monitors the emotional changes of the subjects and gives stimulation intervention in real time) to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and robustness indicators of the system under different applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Application demonstration and optimization</strong>: In cooperation with clinical and industrial partners, the prototype of this system is deployed and trialized in the actual application environment, and the initial demonstration and application of Parkinson's disease patients in motor symptom regulation, emotional counseling in depressed patients, and memory training in patients with cognitive impairment are carried out. Collect clinical feedback and user experience data, and iteratively optimize the system's algorithm parameters, human-computer interaction design, and hardware reliability. Formulate corresponding technical specifications and operating guidelines to lay the foundation for subsequent large-scale application. At the same time, combined with the demonstration results, the technical limitations and risks of this project are analyzed, and the next research and improvement direction is proposed.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"6-Feasibility-analysis\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#6-Feasibility-analysis\" title=\"6. Feasibility analysis\"></a><strong>6. Feasibility analysis</strong></h1><p>The implementation of the project is based on a solid research foundation and mature technical conditions. From the perspective of theoretical foundation, Professor Yucong Duan's team has been working hard in the field of basic theories of cognitive computing and artificial intelligence for many years, and the DIKWP artificial consciousness model and supporting patent achievements have constructed a new cognitive language and architecture from \"black box\" to \"white box\". These early accumulations provide a unique theoretical advantage for this project, which enables us to take the lead in introducing the principle of artificial consciousness into the closed-loop regulation of brain-computer interfaces. In terms of algorithms and software, the research team has rich experience in semantic understanding, machine learning, intelligent control, etc., and the relevant research results have been published in high-level journals at home and abroad, and there are successful application cases in the fields of medical big data analysis and affective computing, which will help the development and verification of key algorithms of the project.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of hardware and experimental conditions, the current technology platform of neuromodulation and brain-computer interface is becoming more and more complete. The existing implantable brain stimulator supports the closed-loop operation of real-time signal acquisition and stimulation output, which provides a mature hardware foundation for the development of new control algorithms in this project. The laboratory of the team is equipped with high-density EEG/EMG acquisition equipment, transcranial magnetic stimulator (TMS), EEG-stimulation synchronous control platform, etc., which can meet the needs of multi-modal data acquisition and closed-loop simulation experiments. In addition, we have established partnerships with a number of hospitals and rehabilitation centers to obtain the actual data and clinical needs of target user groups such as Parkinson's disease and depression, and ensure that the research protocol is suitable for real-world application scenarios.</p>\n<p>As far as the external environment for the implementation of the project is concerned, the national policy strongly supports the cross-innovation of the new generation of artificial intelligence and brain science, and the relevant scientific research plans and capital investment continue to increase, which provides a strong guarantee for the smooth development of the project. At the same time, the forward-looking layout of 6G communication technology has created the necessary conditions for large-scale brain-computer interaction systems—ultra-high-speed and low-latency networks can enable brain-computer interface devices and cloud AI models to achieve real-time connection and collaborative computing. This means that the system developed in this project has good potential for expansion, and can be connected to the cloud knowledge base and computing resources to enhance functions in the future. In addition, the rapid development of domestic high-performance computing chips and smart sensors enables us to use domestic devices to build an efficient ACPU hardware platform, so as to avoid dependence on imported technology, reduce costs and improve the safety and controllability of the system.</p>\n<p>In terms of risks, this project involves the intersection of medicine, artificial intelligence, electronic engineering and other disciplines, and may face challenges in the research and development process, such as complex algorithm models that are difficult to converge and insufficient access to human experimental data. In this regard, we have set up a joint research team composed of artificial intelligence experts, brain scientists, clinicians and engineering technicians to ensure that each key link has professional support in the corresponding fields. In the project plan, links such as algorithm simulation verification and small-sample pre-experiments are reserved to find problems and adjust the scheme in a timely manner. Considering the ethical and safety requirements of human trials, we will mainly use simulation and ex vivo experiments in the prototype verification phase, and work closely with the ethics committees of partner hospitals to gradually carry out limited human trials while ensuring safety. In summary, the project has a solid upfront foundation and controllable implementation risks, and is expected to complete the set goals as planned.</p>\n<h1 id=\"7-Stage-objectives\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#7-Stage-objectives\" title=\"7.

Demonstration of typical application scenarios:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Active Medicine Brain-Controlled Rehabilitation System: In</em> cooperation with rehabilitation hospitals, DIKWP-NIS was applied to limb function training after stroke. Through the multi-modal monitoring of the system, the patient's motor purpose and fatigue degree are identified, and the parameter rhythm of transcranial electrical stimulation or functional electrical stimulation is adjusted in real time to assist the patient to complete limb movement training.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with cognitive training tasks was used to regulate the closed-loop stimulation of the patient's brain memory network: when attention is distracted or memory retrieval difficulty is detected in the cognitive task, the system automatically applies electromagnetic stimulation to specific brain regions to promote neural network activation. Through a period of intervention trial, the differences in cognitive assessment results between the intervention group and the control group were compared, and the effect of the system on the improvement of symptoms of different subtypes of cognitive impairment was verified.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2.

Background and significance</strong></h1><p><strong>National strategic needs and technical background: The principle of cranial neural coding and decoding is the core scientific problem in the field of brain-computer interface (BCI), and it is also the key technical bottleneck to realize the integration of human-computer intelligence. How to \"read\" human purpose and cognitive information from complex and changeable EEG/neural signals and use them to control external devices or interact with artificial intelligence systems is a hot topic of international cutting-edge research. In recent years, there has been a breakthrough in artificial intelligence decoding technology: researchers have been able to decode the words and sentences heard by participants from brain activity under non-invasive conditions, with an accuracy rate of up to 73%. This marks an important step towards \"non-invasive mind reading\" to decode human language and consciousness. However, the existing methods are still limited to the preliminary results in specific contexts, and are far from the full precision and robustness required for practical use. On the one hand, brain signals are highly diverse and the weak noise ratio is low</strong>, which makes it difficult to generalize across subjects and tasks. On the other hand <strong>, there is a lack of system model support between high-level semantic purpose and low-level neural signals, and most of the current decoding adopts \"black box\" machine learning, which lacks a mechanistic understanding of brain cognitive processes, so it is often unable to meet new situations or require explanations. The National Key R&amp;D Program clearly lists \"cranial neural codec principles and technologies\" as a priority direction, that is, we are required to develop new methods for brain information decoding that are both theoretically explainable and cross-modal adaptable, and break through the bottlenecks of existing brain-computer interfaces in multimodal fusion and real-time precise control.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The theoretical value of DIKWP × DIKWP interaction model: In response to the above challenges, this project introduces the original DIKWP artificial consciousness model and its \"dual DIKWP interaction\" framework by Prof. Yucong Duan's team, aiming to provide a new theoretical basis for multimodal brain information processing. DIKWP stands for Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom-Purpose (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom-Purpose) five-level cognitive model, which adds the highest level of \"Purpose\" dimension to the classical DIKW (pyramid) model to emphasize the goal-driven characteristics of agent behavior. Unlike traditional bottom-up linear cognitive architectures, the DIKWP framework is designed as a mesh topology with fully connected interactions and multiple feedbacks. There is not only bottom-up information extraction and integration between the levels, but also top-down regulation and guidance, thus forming a cognitive closed loop of self-evolution. Specifically, the low-level data and signals are processed and upgraded to information, knowledge,</strong> and wisdom, and the high-level wisdom and purpose in turn guide new data collection and information selection, and realize cross-level feedback adjustment. This multi-path interaction mechanism ensures that the system can continuously accumulate new knowledge in a dynamic environment on the one hand, flexibly adjust the goal on the other hand, and continuously optimize its own behavior strategy. Therefore, the DIKWP model is naturally suitable to characterize the characteristics of brain multimodal information processing: <strong>parallel multi-pathway</strong>, <strong>hierarchical multi-scale, and closed-loop regulation</strong>。 For example, in the process of language generation, the brain does not convert semantics into sentences linearly, but involves the interaction of multiple layers of information such as vocabulary, syntax, and pragmatics. Through the cycle of the knowledge layer and the wisdom layer, the DIKWP model can make the language generation not only consider the low-level lexical data, but also combine the high-level purpose and background knowledge to achieve a generation effect that is more in line with the logic of human language, which is similar to the two-way integration of semantics and syntax by the language center in the human brain. For example, in motor control, the instructions of the motor cortex of the brain will be influenced by the modulation of cerebellum and sensory feedback to achieve fine coordination; The network structure of DIKWP can simulate this interaction of sensory-motor circuits, so that the motor neural coding model not only has a feedforward instruction pathway, but also a feedback correction mechanism, so as to more accurately describe the principle of fine motor control.</p>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that Professor Yucong Duan further proposed the \"DIKWP×DIKWP\" <strong>interaction paradigm to describe the intelligent interaction and fusion across semantic space and conceptual space. To put it simply, it is to connect two DIKWP frameworks: one represents the external environment</strong>/semantic space (such as the information flow of external languages and visual scenes), and the other represents the internal cognitive**/conceptual space**(The state of the agent's brain). Through the mapping interaction of dual DIKWP, the human brain's understanding and response mechanism to external information can be simulated. For example, when the human brain understands a piece of text, there is a mapping from semantics to concepts (external language maps to internal knowledge) and from concept to semantics generation (forming answers based on internal understanding) – this is the process of mapping semantic space to conceptual space in both directions. At present, the research on this cross-space interaction mechanism is still relatively weak. This project introduces the DIKWP×DIKWP paradigm into brain-computer interface modeling to bridge the gap between brain signal patterns and AI semantics: on the one hand, mapping human brain neural activity (data/information level) to the large model semantic representation of artificial intelligence (knowledge/Wisdom level); On the other hand, based on the reasoning results and purpose of the AI model, feedback instructions that can be understood by the brain (data/information level) are generated. This two-way docking mechanism is expected to solve the problem of semantic gap in the current brain-computer interface and provide a new idea for the decoding of complex cognitive functions.</p>\n<p><strong>The necessity of introducing the theory of artificial consciousness: Under the framework of DIKWP, the \"P\" (Purpose/Purpose) at the top level actually corresponds to the content of the category of artificial consciousness. This project integrates the theory of artificial consciousness into the study of brain codecs and uses its interpretation of higher cognitive functions to guide neural signal analysis.</strong> Artificial consciousness focuses on how to realize cognitive processes similar to human consciousness in artificial systems, including self-model, <strong>purpose-driven</strong>, metacognitive <strong>and other elements. The introduction of these theories into our brain control system has the following important implications:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Mapping and analysis of higher cognitive functions: The theory of artificial consciousness provides a new perspective to understand the relationship between higher functions and neural activity, such as attention, purpose, decision-making, and state of consciousness. For example, models of consciousness such as the Global Workspace Theory suggest that certain globally synchronized patterns of neural activity in the brain correspond to conscious content. Drawing on such ideas, this project introduces the consciousness layer/wisdom layer into the DIKWP model to explain which neural signal patterns correspond to the user</strong>'s purpose/attention, so as to improve the ability of the decoding algorithm to grasp the user**'s real purpose**.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Improve the robustness and generalization of decoding: AI decoders with human-like adaptive awareness can adjust the interpretation of the same signal according to changes in the environment and context, avoiding rigidity. Once the AI has metacognitive capabilities to monitor the uncertainty of its own decisions and report to its superiors, the system can proactively request more information or adopt a more robust decoding strategy when brain signals are noisy or new patterns emerge, thereby reducing the bit error rate. This kind of self-supervision is an important feature of artificial consciousness, which is expected to solve the problem of the sudden decline in the accuracy of current decoding algorithms in the face of new environments.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Enhance explainability and human-machine comprehensibility: The artificial consciousness framework emphasizes the explicit and modular internal processing, and each layer has clear functions. For example, in DIKWP, each layer of processing has clear semantics: the data layer extracts physiological signal features, the information layer identifies primary patterns, the knowledge layer makes rule reasoning, the Wisdom layer makes decisions, and the Purpose layer gives purpose constraints. Such a design makes the AI inference process transparent</strong>, and the intermediate steps can be extracted and reviewed, so as to achieve a \"white box\" <strong>interpretable AI. For BCIs, transparency in the decoding process means that doctors and users can understand why the system interprets brain signals the way they do, increasing trust in the system and safety of use. This is especially critical in medical scenarios to avoid</strong> the uncertain risks brought about by \"black box AI\" in life-related decision-making. According to reports, the DIKWP model has greatly improved the interpretability and transparency of AI systems due to its modularization and evidence-traceable inference process, ensuring that every step of decision-making can be traced in fields such as medical diagnosis. Similarly, we expect the brain control system to be structurally <strong>\"understandable and understandable to</strong> humans\", that is, the human brain and AI have a common semantic baseline to ensure that the decoding results are always within the comprehensible and controllable range of humans.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Provide theoretical support for new brain-computer interfaces: The combination of artificial consciousness and DIKWP is expected to build a new paradigm of purpose-driven brain-computer interfaces. Traditional brain-computer interfaces are mostly static mappings from signals to instructions, but with the guidance of the artificial consciousness framework, the system can have an initiative similar to \"consciousness\". For example, the system can activate relevant decoding pathways in advance based on the inference of the user's goals (e.g., the user focuses on analyzing signals from movement-related brain regions when the user wants to move the arm); When the user's attention is lost, the system can detect and pause operations, etc. This human-computer interaction greatly improves the intelligence level of the system and makes the brain control smoother and more natural.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, this project will meet the national guidelines for \"cranial nerve coding and decoding principles\", and <strong>create a new path of multimodal brain information processing and decoding with the support of DIKWP× DIKWP model and artificial consciousness theory. It has great academic innovation significance: on the one hand, it fills the theoretical gap of cross-level and cross-modal brain cognitive modeling, and develops a new theory of interpretive brain decoding; On the other hand, it lays the foundation for engineering applications, promotes the next generation of high-precision brain control systems from concept to reality, and provides revolutionary technologies for the rehabilitation of disabled people, intelligent neuroprosthesis, human-machine synergy and other fields. At present, cutting-edge brain-computer experiments such as BrainGate have proved that the use of invasive electrodes can allow paralyzed patients to grasp objects or manipulate exoskeletons to walk through their minds, but there are still problems such as difficulty in signal interpretation and expensive and cumbersome equipment. Our research will strive to break through these bottlenecks with more intelligent algorithms and more systematic models, so as to seize the opportunity for China in the competition of the strategic highland of brain-computer interface.</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"2-Research-objectives-and-overall-technical-roadmap\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-Research-objectives-and-overall-technical-roadmap\" title=\"2. Research objectives and overall technical roadmap\"></a><strong>2. Research objectives and overall technical roadmap</strong></h1><p><strong>Overall goal: This project aims to build a</strong> closed-loop brain control system from cognitive purpose to neural coding to AI decoding to drive peripheral feedback, and form a complete theoretical and technical methodology system for encoding and decoding human advanced brain functions. Specifically, we will reveal the neural coding mechanism of cognitive purposes such as language and movement in the brain, develop a multimodal and high-precision AI decoding algorithm for brain signals, integrate and develop a prototype of a brain control system that supports multiple external devices, and explore the alignment method between human cognitive processes and artificial intelligence models. Through three years of research, we strive to theoretically enrich the cognitive computing model of cranial nerve encoding and decoding, improve the performance of brain-computer interface by an order of magnitude in technology, and promote the implementation of brain control technology in the field of rehabilitation medicine and human-computer interaction in application.</p>\n<p>Overall technical route: Focusing on the above goals, we will follow the technical route of \"<strong>basic mechanism research, model algorithm development, system integration verification</strong>\", and break through key scientific problems and engineering difficulties in turn. Figure 1 summarizes the architecture and technical route of the closed-loop brain control system to be constructed in this project, and each module corresponds to the cycle of \"cognitive purpose→ neural signal coding→ signal acquisition→ AI decoding→ device control and feedback\" from the information flow</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Cognitive Purpose: This is the starting point of a closed loop and represents the user's mental purpose or behavioral goal in a specific situation. For example, reaching for a cup, saying a word, or imagining a picture in your head. Based on the artificial consciousness model, we will define a \"cognitive generation layer\" that describes the user's high-level purpose, attention, and state of consciousness. This is equivalent to the Purpose and Wisdom parts of the DIKWP model, which contain the user's current goals, task understanding, and knowledge and strategies to be adapted in the task context. The cognitive generative layer is not directly derived from brain signals, but is modeled by designing experimental paradigms and utilizing artificial consciousness simulations. For example, the paradigm of subjects performing specific cognitive tasks (such as imagining movements, conceiving sentences) can be introduced, combined with questionnaires or behavioral reports, to determine the purpose content of subjects in different trials, and provide labeling basis for subsequent neural coding modeling.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Neural encoding (brain signaling layer): Cognitive purpose is encoded in the brain into a series of neural activity patterns, including firing sequences, local field potential oscillations, brain waves, etc. This project will focus on the neural coding mechanisms of language and movement, two typical functions, and extend the consideration of patterns such as visual imagery. Through multi-brain region and multimodal data collection, we extract neural coding features</strong>, such as the frequency band power changes of the motor cortex corresponding to the motor purpose, and the specific temporal and frontal activations of the temporal and frontal lobes corresponding to the language purpose. Here, the data layer (<strong>D) and information layer (I) concepts of the DIKWP framework are used to extract and fuse the original neural data at multiple levels, so that the components related to the high-level semantics are retained as much as possible and irrelevant noise is eliminated. We will construct a neural coding model of DIKWP interaction structure</strong>, that is, using the multipath network of the DIKWP model, the neural signals of different brain regions and different modalities are regarded as data streams on the network nodes, and <strong>the interactive processing and integration are carried out at the data-information-knowledge levels. For example, for language</strong> purpose encoding, the model will fuse the data of the auditory cortex (hearing the echo of its own internal language) with the information of the language center (word choice signal), and introduce the role of contextual memory through the knowledge layer nodes, so as to form an overall neural representation of the purpose of a sentence. <strong>The output of this module is</strong>: a \"neural coding representation\" that can be read by the AI model, corresponding to the mapping of cognitive purpose in the brain signal space.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Electrical Signal Acquisition and Transmission: In order to validate and apply the above coding models, we need high-performance brain signal acquisition devices and interfaces. This project plans to build a high-channel-count, multi-modal fusion brain signal acquisition platform, including non-invasive high-density EEG/MEG</strong>, functional near-infrared (fNIRS), and newly developed ultrasound brain imaging technology. Among them, ultrasound neuroimaging has the characteristics of high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution, which is expected to make up for the shortcomings of EEG/MEG and fMRI. We will explore the method of EEG+ functional ultrasound fusion to achieve a more comprehensive observation of neural activity by temporally synchronized and spatially registered data of different modalities. At the same time, we will use wireless transmission and embedded signal pre-processing technology to ensure that large-capacity data can be <strong>transmitted to the decoding algorithm module in real time and reliably. This part is equivalent to building the sensing and data layer infrastructure in the DIKWP model, providing a high-quality \"data source\" for the closed-loop system. The output of this link is: a stream of multi-channel neural signals that have undergone preprocessing and preliminary feature extraction, which is fed to the AI decoding module in real time.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>AI decoding (artificial intelligence cognitive layer): This is the brain \"readout\" link of the closed-loop system, and the core is to develop a new multimodal brain signal decoding algorithm</strong>. The AI decoding module of this project will integrate the concepts of knowledge layer (<strong>K) and wisdom layer (W) of the DIKWP model, as well as the purpose understanding mechanism of the artificial consciousness system. Specifically, we plan to adopt a hierarchical decoding architecture</strong>: firstly, the deep learning model performs underlying pattern recognition (corresponding to the conversion from the information layer to the knowledge layer) of neural signals, and extracts primary decoding results such as motion direction and speech semantics. Subsequently, the knowledge reasoning ability of large models (such as large language model LLM or large vision model) is introduced, and semantic fusion and high-level inference (corresponding to the decision-making process of the Wisdom layer) are performed on the primary results. The role of artificial consciousness here is reflected in two aspects: first, we set up a <strong>Purpose inference submodule</strong>, which is equivalent to the \"Purpose Layer (P)\" of simulated artificial consciousness, which combines the context (such as the current task, environmental state) and the monitoring of the user's consciousness state, and infers that the decoded signal at this moment may correspond to the user's <strong>Purpose</strong> and generate a priori assumptions about the operational objectives; Second, metacognitive control is embedded in the decoding process, that is, the algorithm evaluates its confidence in the decoding result, and when the confidence is low, it can request data for a longer window or start an alternate decoding path (such as switching decoding model parameters), so as to improve the overall reliability. The output of this module is a machine-readable understanding of the user's purpose, such as recognizing that the user wants to perform the action of \"grabbing a cup\" at the moment, or recognizing that the user's brain is internally reciting the phrase \"a glass of water\". It is worth emphasizing that our multi-modal decoding model design pursues low latency and high accuracy: by optimizing the model structure and inference algorithm, the delay of decoding from signal acquisition to output result is controlled within hundreds of milliseconds, which meets the requirements of real-time closed-loop control.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Peripheral Control &amp; Feedback: This is the execution and closure of a closed-loop link. According to the user Purpose decoded by AI, this module will convert the Purpose into a specific control command and send it to the target external device, and process the feedback information of the device to pass it to the user, so as to form a human-machine integrated control loop. For example, for a peripheral such as a robotic arm, when the \"grabbing\" purpose is decoded</strong> , the control module needs to generate the motion instruction sequence of each joint of the robotic arm to complete the grasping action; During the execution process, the sensors of the robotic arm will collect feedback such as grasping force and object touch, which can be communicated to the user through visual/tactile devices on the one hand (such as displaying the status of the robotic arm through VR glasses or providing tactile feedback to the user's skin through stimulation devices), and on the other hand, it is also fed back to the AI decoding module for correcting subsequent decoding (for example, if the grasping failure is detected, the decoding module may have made an error). In this way, the whole system forms a closed loop: the user's purpose affects the brain signal, the brain signal is decoded by AI to control the device, and the device feedback affects the user's cognition, thus entering the next cycle. We will use the knowledge update and purpose adjustment mechanism in the DIKWP model to optimize the closed-loop control performance—for each round completed, the system will update the internal knowledge base (e.g., success/failure experience) and adjust the future action strategy accordingly (Wisdom layer), and the user's goal layer may also change (e.g., goal switching when the task is completed). Through multiple cycle training, it is expected that both humans and machines can achieve synergy: the user can more stably generate brain signals that are easy to interpret by the machine, and the machine can gradually learn the user's characteristics and achieve proficient cooperation.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, the overall technical route is based on the DIKWP interaction structure, which integrates the cognitive purpose layer, neural coding layer, decoding decision layer, and device execution layer into a closed-loop system. Among them, the DIKWP model runs throughout: from the initial brain data collection to the final Wisdom decision feedback, every step is semantic localization and interaction under the DIKWP framework. This design allows us to clearly define the research task: <strong>first, at the basic level, we can figure out</strong> \"how cognitive purpose is encoded as brain signals\" (research content 3.1), and <strong>then at the model level, \"how to efficiently decode brain signals in multiple modalities\" (research content 3.2</strong>); <strong>Then, at the system level, \"how to drive complex peripherals with decoding results\" (research content 3.3</strong>); <strong>Finally, at the level of human-computer integration, \"how to align the semantics of human brain cognition and AI model\" (research content 3.4</strong>) was explored. This route not only ensures the logical connection between the various research contents, but also lays a phased technical foundation for the final system integration.</p>\n<h1 id=\"3-Key-research-content\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-Key-research-content\" title=\"3. Key research content\"></a><strong>3. Key research content</strong></h1><p>Focusing on the above technical routes and goals, we have identified the following four directions as the key research contents of this project:</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-1-Modeling-of-fine-motor-and-language-neural-coding\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-1-Modeling-of-fine-motor-and-language-neural-coding\" title=\"3.1 Modeling of fine motor and language neural coding\"></a><strong>3.1 Modeling of fine motor and language neural coding</strong></h2><p><strong>Objectives: To elucidate</strong> the neural coding mechanism of human fine motor (such as fingers, wrist joints, etc.) and language (internal language planning and speech) functions in the brain, and to construct a unified neural coding representation structure based on the DIKWP × DIKWP interaction model. We will answer: How does the brain encode a specific cognitive purpose (wanting to accomplish an action or express a sentence) into a pattern of neural activity? What is the relationship between the data layer signals, <strong>information layer features and higher-level cognitive semantics in these patterns? Is there a coding pattern that is consistent across individuals and tasks that can be generalized?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Research content and program:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Multimodal Brain Signal Acquisition and Experimental Paradigm Design: We will design different task paradigms to obtain brain data for the two major functions of motor and language. For example, in the motor coding study, subjects were recruited to perform specific hand movements (such as index finger and little finger flexion and extension, palm grasp relaxation, etc.), and data such as high-density EEG, MEG, and invasive cortical electrodes if necessary (such as cooperation opportunities in patients with clinical epilepsy) were recorded to obtain the corresponding motor cortex activation patterns. In language coding studies, participants are asked to read/listen to sentences and repeat them in their heads, or imagine saying specific sentences, and record the corresponding activity in the brain's language areas. For the complement of visual modalities, we also consider visual imagery tasks in simple scenes (such as imagining the shape of a specific object) to obtain signals from visual areas such as occipital lobes. Through multimodal acquisition, we ensure that the data dimensions cover information with complementary spatiotemporal resolutions:</strong> EEG/MEG provides millisecond-level temporal detail, and fNIRS/functional ultrasound provides millimeter-level spatial distribution, enabling a comprehensive view of neural coding phenomena.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Neural coding analysis of DIKWP framework: In terms of data processing, we introduce the concept of DIKWP model to perform hierarchical decomposition and interactive analysis of the neural coding process. The specific method is as follows: firstly, the original signal is regarded as the input of the data layer (D), and the signal processing and machine learning methods are used to extract preliminary features (such as frequency band power spectrum, neuron firing rate, etc.), which is equivalent to the information layer (I) representation; Then, the association between these features and the cognitive variables designed in the experimental paradigm is explored, in an attempt to further elevate the features to the knowledge layer (K),</strong> that is, to find the structured pattern. For example, to analyze whether different finger movements in motor tasks correspond to different spatial patterns in the EEG spectrum, such as the difference in the local inhibition range of μ rhythm; To analyze whether words of different semantic classes (nouns, verbs, etc.) elicit distinguishable patterns in brain signals in language tasks. This step is equivalent to refining \"neural semantics\" at the knowledge level**: finding the correspondence between decodeable neural features and specific cognitive meanings. We will use a combination of statistical analysis (e.g., EEG power topology map difference test), encoding model**, and decoding model: on the one hand, we will build a prediction model from stimulus/task to brain signals to test hypothesis, and on the other hand, we will train a decoder to predict cognitive state from brain signals to test the discriminant power of these features.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Multipath interaction coding modeling: The advantage of DIKWP is multi-level multipath interaction. Based on this hypothesis, we hypothesize that the brain coding of fine motor and language is not isolated from each other, but rather intersects and merges, for example, language has a motor component (vocalization involves tongue and throat movements), and that movement is also regulated by language (through verbal instructions). We will build a DIKWP ×DIKWP interaction coding model</strong> that treats movement and language as two DIKWP chains that interact at certain levels. For example, in the Wisdom layer (W) interaction: when the participant performs language-related actions (such as pronunciation, action, imagination), the language content (semantics) and the motor schema are synchronously activated in the brain and affect each other, and the knowledge/Wisdom node of the DIKWP model should contain the integration of the two aspects of information. This model will realize cross-functional neural coding representation by jointly analyzing the data of motor tasks and language tasks. Specifically, we plan to train a multi-task deep neural network in which some of its parameters are shared for learning generic brain signal features (underlying data/information representations), and the other part is for motor and language task outputs (high-level semantic decoding), respectively. Through this shared-specific hybrid structure, we hope to capture the commonalities and personalities of motor and language coding: the commonalities may correspond to general attention, working memory, and other modulations (which should be common to the Wisdom layer), and the personality part corresponds to the specific coding patterns of the motor and language cortex. During the training process, we will introduce <strong>the Purpose layer prior</strong>, that is, to instruct the model to decode the current main decoded motion or language according to the experimental task, so as to simulate the selective opening of the DIKWP Purpose layer to the underlying pathways. Model performance will be evaluated by the improved decoding accuracy of multi-task and the ability to transfer between tasks: for example, whether some model parameters trained on a language task can accelerate the learning of a motor task and vice versa. This will validate our hypothesis about the motion-language encoding interaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Generalizable neural coding representation: With the above model, we will refine a unified neural coding representation structure</strong> with the potential for generalization across subjects and modalities. This may take the form of a template spatial feature or a domain-invariant representation. For example, the positional features of the relative cortex functional areas were extracted in the motion coding, so that the differences between different subjects were reduced. Extract semantically relevant network connection features in language encoding, rather than individual electrode waveforms, etc. Finally, it is hoped to obtain a high-dimensional representation vector or tensor, and its dimensions correspond to some interpretable neural modules (such as \"Purpose X activation intensity\", \"language semantic Y activation intensity\", etc.). This representation is the input of the project's subsequent decoding algorithm and the bridge to align the AI model.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expected Results: Through this study, we will obtain new theoretical discoveries and data support for cranial neural coding</strong>. In terms of movement, it may reveal for example, the fine distribution of cortical topology of single finger movements, and the co-coding patterns of multi-finger combined movements; In terms of language, it may reveal the different coding pathways of the brain for nouns, verbs and other category words, as well as the differences and connections between internal language (imaginary language) and external auditory language. If the research goes well, we will publish 1-2 papers on the coding mechanism of motor and language brains, and form a set of general neural coding models to provide a direct basis for the development of decoding algorithms. Importantly, we will accumulate a multimodal large-scale brain signal dataset and grasp the implicit \"data-information-knowledge\" transformation path to verify the effectiveness of the DIKWP model in explaining the cognitive processes of biological brains.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-2-Multimodal-decoding-model-design\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-2-Multimodal-decoding-model-design\" title=\"3.2 Multimodal decoding model design\"></a><strong>3.2 Multimodal decoding model design</strong></h2><p><strong>Research Objectives: To develop a multimodal AI decoding model of brain signals combined with artificial consciousness Purpose reasoning</strong>, to achieve low-latency and high-accuracy decoding of multiple types of brain activities such as movement, language, and vision. The model should be able to map the neural encoded representations extracted in Section 3.1 back to the corresponding semantic commands or contents, such as restoring brain signals to the sequence of hand movements imagined by the user, or decoding sentences that the user hears/thinks. We pursue a unified decoding framework that is compatible with multiple input signal modes and interprets multiple forms of Purpose outputs. At the same time, the human-aware <strong>Purpose layer and Wisdom layer logic are introduced</strong> to make the decoding process context-aware and adaptively adjustable, so as to improve the decoding accuracy and reduce latency and false positives.</p>\n<p><strong>Research content and program:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>The overall architecture of the multimodal decoding model: We design a hierarchical and progressive decoding architecture, referring to the middle and high levels of the DIKWP model: firstly, the perception decoding layer decodes the low-level features of the brain signal into preliminary recognition results (corresponding to the information layer → knowledge layer conversion of DIKWP), and then the cognitive decoding layer combines context and knowledge to make semantic interpretation and reasoning decisions on the preliminary results (corresponding to the knowledge layer →</strong> Wisdom layer transformation), and finally <strong>The Purpose decision-making layer produces the final output based on the inference results and the estimated user</strong> Purpose (corresponding to the Wisdom layer → the Purpose layer). For example, for language decoding, the perception layer may first output a string of candidate words or phoneme probabilities, the cognitive layer may use language model knowledge to spell out possible sentences on these basis, and the purpose decision-making layer selects the sentence that best meets the user's purpose as the output based on the context of the current topic.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>**Semantic Decoding of Converged Large Models (LLM/CV): At the cognitive decoding layer, we will leverage the powerful prior knowledge and semantic representation capabilities of today's large pre-trained models. Specifically, for language decoding, we introduce pre-trained large language models (such as the GPT series) that take the representation vectors extracted from brain signals as cues (**prompt) or conditional input, so that the language model can produce the corresponding text. Recently, it has been proved that the vectors decoded by fMRI can be directly fed into the pre-trained language model for autoregressive text generation, which can generate sentences that are closer to the original semantics without the limitation of the candidate set. We will draw on this idea: use the neural encoded representation obtained in our section 3.1 as a conditional embedding, access the Chinese large language model (considering that the application population mainly speaks Chinese, we will give priority to selecting or training the Chinese language model), and let it generate text output. This method is expected to break through the limitations of traditional classification/matching methods and realize the free generation of open vocabulary. Similarly, in terms of motion decoding, we consider introducing large models for high-level planning, such as combining reinforcement learning pre-training models to score or correct the decoded preliminary motion sequences to ensure that the output action sequences are physically coherent and semantically consistent with the purpose. In terms of visual purpose decoding (e.g., decoding images imagined by the user), generative vision models (e.g., diffusion models, generative adversarial networks) can be used to convert brain signal representations into images – not the focus of this project, but we will follow the latest developments to determine feasibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Purpose Layer Integration and Artificial Consciousness Unit: In order to integrate the advantages of artificial consciousness into decoding, we specially designed the Purpose Inference Module</strong>。 The module is located at the top layer of the decoding architecture (corresponding to the DIKWP Purpose layer P), and its input is a number of possible outputs and confidence levels provided by the cognitive decoding layer, and its output is a high-level inference of the user's current overall purpose and the selection and regulation of the output results. This can be achieved by using a sequential decision-making model (such as a Transformer-based policy network), which takes the context of the current moment (such as previously recognized content or previous motion control state), the internal state of the AI model (such as the hidden state of the language model), and the aforementioned AI output candidates as inputs, and generates a \"Purpose state vector\" through inference. This vector can be understood as the AI's estimation of \"what the user really wants to achieve\". For example, during a continuous interaction, the Purpose state vector might encode the message \"The user is trying to complete the water cup task\". With this Purpose vector, we evaluate how well the current AI candidate output matches it, and finally select the output with the highest score as the final execution/presentation result of the system. If the match is not high, it may trigger the re-evaluation of the AI decoding layer (equivalent to metacognition prompting it to \"what was decoded just now may be wrong, try again\"). This Purpose inference module is equivalent to installing a \"thinking brain\" on the AI decoder, so that it is not limited to guessing the result directly from the signal one by one, but has a global task awareness to guide the decoding. This also mimics the process by which executive control areas such as the frontal lobe in the human brain regulate the interpretation of sensory information according to the current goal.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Low latency optimization and real-time assurance: We will focus on reducing latency in model design and implementation. On the one hand, the hierarchical architecture can be used for parallel flow processing: the perception layer outputs part of the results in real time for subsequent use, without waiting for the end of the complete sentence; On the other hand, the use of lightweight large models (or distilled models) combined with dedicated hardware acceleration (such as GPU/FPGA) to optimize the time-consuming links such as language model inference to the order of tens of milliseconds. In addition, we will investigate streaming decoding techniques, in which the model can output incremental results at any time in the case of continuous brain signal input (e.g., words are output while listening to brain signals, as is the case with speech input methods). We plan to achieve this through a sequence-to-sequence model with closed-loop feedback training, so that the model learns to update the previous output when it gets a new brain signal instead of overturning it entirely, so as to maintain coherence and low latency while ensuring accuracy.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Model Adaptation and Continuous Learning: Considering the individual differences and time-varying characteristics of brain signals</strong>, we will make the decoding model have certain online learning and adaptive capabilities. On the one hand, a transfer learning strategy is introduced: the model is trained on a large amount of general data in advance, and then a small amount of rapid fine-tuning is done for an individual user to adapt it to the signal characteristics of that user (e.g., using the user's calibration data fine-tune decoder). On the other hand, closed-loop self-calibration is implemented: the model parameters are updated using user correction in closed-loop feedback (e.g., user feedback decoding errors through other means). We can even monitor biofeedback such as error-dependent potentials (ErrP) in brain signals: when the AI output does not meet the user's expectations, a specific ErrP waveform often appears in the user's brain, and the system detects it and determines that the last decoding error was corrected and adjusts it. This allows the decoder to be used more accurately and less frequently manually calibrated over long periods of time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expected Results: The research content will deliver a multimodal brain signal decoding software/module</strong>. We plan to achieve the following indicators in the experimental verification: for a single type of task (e.g., hand motion imagination classification at rest), the decoding accuracy is improved by &gt;20% compared with the existing methods; For comprehensive scenarios (such as tasks that include both motion and language purposes), the decoding model can automatically distinguish and identify different categories of purposes, with an accuracy rate of more than 80% and a delay control of less than 200ms, which is significantly better than the traditional non-conscious model. In the language decoding test, we expect to achieve the ability to decode consecutive sentences from non-intrusive signals, such as recovering the general idea of the brain signals heard by the participants when listening to the story, and the content matching degree is more than 50% in the limited short story scenario. It is worth mentioning that the latest MindLLM model in the world has successfully decoded the fMRI signal to text. We will evaluate these results against each other to demonstrate the benefits of the introduction of DIKWP and artificial awareness in this project. In addition, we will produce more than 2 academic papers on multimodal decoding algorithms and purpose fusion methods, which will be published in top conferences/journals in neural engineering or artificial intelligence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-3-Development-of-high-precision-brain-control-system\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-3-Development-of-high-precision-brain-control-system\" title=\"3.3 Development of high-precision brain control system\"></a><strong>3.3 Development of high-precision brain control system</strong></h2><p><strong>Research Objective: Based on the above coding and decoding results, a high-precision real-time brain control system will be developed in an integrated manner</strong>. The system should support at least 5 different types of external devices, including but not limited to: robotic arms, exoskeleton robots, smart wheelchairs, prosthetic hands, and drones, etc., so that users can manipulate high-degree devices with a degree of near-natural finesse through brain signals. We will focus on solving engineering challenges such as stability, real-time, and security in system integration, and integrate the state evaluation and adaptive module of the DIKWP model to ensure that the system can evaluate and adjust the user's and its own state in real time during continuous operation to maintain high-precision control. In addition, we will explore the possibility of parallel control of multiple peripherals to lay the foundation for multi-task brain control.</p>\n<p><strong>Research content and program:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>The overall architecture of the brain control system: In terms of software, we have developed the brain control center platform software, which integrates the AI decoding module and multi-device interface module of Section 3.2. The platform follows a modular design</strong>: it includes a signal processing module, a decoding decision module, a device mapping module, and a monitoring and evaluation module, etc., and communicates with each other through a publish/subscribe mechanism to ensure scalability and reliability. In terms of hardware, we have set up a brain-controlled workstation, equipped with a high-speed data acquisition card, GPU computing unit and various wireless communication units, so that it can be connected to EEG caps, exoskeleton drive motors, robotic arm controllers and other peripherals at the same time. In terms of network topology, a <strong>centralized-distributed combination is adopted</strong>: brain signal decoding and high-level decision-making are centralized at workstations, while underlying device control is distributed by embedded controllers and connected through low-latency bus/wireless connections.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Support the development of control interfaces for multiple types of peripherals: We will design corresponding instruction sets and mapping strategies for the control requirements of different types of peripherals</strong>. For example, for the robotic arm (high degree of freedom mechanical actuator, generally 6~7 joints), we define the brain control instructions including the end position increment or specific grasping action, etc., and then convert them into the angle commands of each joint by the inverse kinematics module; For exoskeleton lower limb robots (used for walking aids), brain-controlled commands can be defined as simple high-level commands such as \"forward\", \"stop\" and \"turn\", and then the robot's own gait planning executes the details; For prosthetic hands, instructions may involve flexion and extension of each finger or several preset gesture switching; For smart wheelchairs, the instructions include direction and speed adjustment; For drones, the commands include basic flight controls such as up/down/forward/stop. We will ensure that at least 5 peripheral protocols are connected, and each implements a set of brain control interface libraries. Due to the different response characteristics and safety requirements of different devices, we will set up a safety checksum arbitration mechanism for each type of device: for example, the robotic arm and exoskeleton need to prevent injuries caused by too fast movement, so buffers are added when the human brain emits violent abnormal signals; UAV control needs to consider communication packet loss, so set up mechanisms such as automatic hovering for packet loss.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>DIKWP state evaluation and adaptive module: In order to ensure high accuracy and safety, we introduce the real-time state evaluation module of the DIKWP model as the \"brain steward\" of the system. The module continuously monitors three aspects of status:</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1) <strong>User status</strong>: including the user's brain signal quality, concentration degree, fatigue degree, etc., fatigue can be judged by analyzing the degree of theta wave inhibition in EEG, and attention transfer can be judged by analyzing electroocular electrophrasal artifacts. When a user's poor state (such as inattention) is detected, the high-risk action can be postponed and the user can be prompted to rest.</p>\n<p>2) <strong>Decoder status</strong>: Monitor the performance indicators of the AI decoder module, such as the recent output entropy value (uncertainty), error rate evaluation (which can be judged by comparing the feedback from the device sensor with the expected result), etc. If the decoding confidence level is found to be declining or there are continuous errors, the module can decide to trigger automatic calibration: for example, by calling the system's built-in calibration sequence (allowing the user to imagine several known instructions) to recalibrate the decoding model, or to dynamically adjust the decoding parameters;</p>\n<p>3) <strong>Equipment status</strong>: Monitor the working status of peripherals (temperature, current, execution accuracy, etc.) and the interaction with the environment (such as whether the grip force of the robotic arm exceeds the limit) through sensors, and evaluate whether there are risks or deviations in combination with the knowledge base. Based on the above monitoring, the status assessment module acts as a Wisdom layer to manage the operation of the whole system: it does not intervene under normal circumstances, and once an abnormal trend is detected, it adaptively maintains the stable and high-precision operation of the system by adjusting parameters, downgrading or issuing warnings. This continuous self-test and self-adjustment function is one of the highlights of our system that distinguishes it from previous rigid brain control systems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>High degree of freedom fine control algorithm: to achieve high-precision control, the brain control instructions are not only correct</strong>, but also continuous smooth and <strong>fine-tuned</strong>。 To this end, we will introduce intelligent smoothing and optimization algorithms in the mapping process from the decoded result to the device instructions. For example, for the joint angle control of the robotic arm, the discrete target position sequences decoded directly from the brain signal may be used, and we will use the optimal control or deep reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize these sequences under the premise of satisfying the user's purpose, so that the joint movement trajectory is smooth and obstacles are avoided. For example, for prosthetic gesture control, we may use collaborative control: combined with auxiliary signals such as electromyography, the brain's rough instructions + local feedback can be finely adjusted, so that the finger strength can be accurately controlled. We also plan to add fault-tolerant control to the device side, for example, when the brain signal is transiently disturbed and the instruction is abnormal, the device controller can automatically dampen according to the nearest purpose and physical limit to prevent dangerous actions. These measures are designed to improve the accuracy and safety of the overall control.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Parallel control of multiple peripherals and task collaboration: As a cutting-edge exploration, we will try the brain control of one person and multiple machines, that is, the user controls multiple devices to complete the task through brain signals at the same time. This is a huge challenge for both brain decoding and interface mapping: decoders need to be able to distinguish between parallel</strong> purposes or switch between purposes quickly in time. Therefore, we will preliminarily choose a relatively simple scenario test, such as controlling the movement of the wheelchair and the grasping of the robotic arm at the same time—the corresponding brain signals may be used to imagine the left-hand movement command to control the wheelchair steering, and the right-hand movement may be used to control the robotic arm. On the interface, we build a task management layer that allows the user to activate different control modes through specific brain signal patterns (similar to switching \"control channels\"), or the AI Purpose module automatically determines which device the user is currently focused on. Although this is a difficult scaling goal, exploring its feasibility will lay the foundation for more complex human-robot collaboration in the future.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expected Results: This research will result in a prototype of a brain-controlled system</strong> that demonstrates high-precision brain-controlled operation of multiple devices in a laboratory environment. The assessment indicators include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Control accuracy: For typical equipment tasks (such as robotic arm grabbing small objects, exoskeleton assisted walking), the success rate needs to reach more than 80%, and key parameters such as the positioning error at the end of the robotic arm &lt; 2 cm, and the exoskeleton gait synchronization delay &lt; 0.2 seconds.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Real-time performance: The total delay from brain signal acquisition to device response &lt; 300 ms (including 150 ms for decoding &lt;algorithms, 50 ms &lt;for network transmission, and the rest for device execution), and the data refresh rate of each module processing frequency reaches more than 100 Hz, ensuring that users have no obvious sense of delay.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Robustness: The system can run continuously for &gt; 1 hour without interruption without manual recalibration; It can maintain &gt;90% function even when a certain amount of noise is introduced or the user's attention fluctuates, and there is no dangerous misoperation. Record the number of triggers for each automatic calibration, which should be less than 1 time every 30 minutes.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Versatility: Successfully adapt to ≥ 5 kinds of peripheral devices, and complete at least 2 different functional tests for each of them. For example: robotic arm (to complete the two types of actions of \"pouring water\" and \"writing\"), prosthetic hand (to complete the two types of actions of \"pinching the ball\" and \"holding the paper cup\"), etc. When switching between different devices, only the output interface configuration needs to be changed, and the core decoding algorithm needs to be changed, proving the universality of the system.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>User experience: A small number of healthy volunteers and target users (such as 1 amputee and 1 paraplegic) were invited to participate in the trial and subjective feedback was collected. The goal was that most of the participants said that the control experience was natural, that the learning time was &lt; 30 minutes, and that they were willing to use it repeatedly. We will pay special attention to the mental load of users during use, and strive to minimize it through intelligent system assistance.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, compared with 2019, when a French scientific research team used quadriplegic patients to use invasive electrodes to control the exoskeleton to walk and touch objects, our system is expected to achieve similar functions and be more flexible under non-invasive conditions; For another example, compared to BrainGate, which uses a brain-computer interface to control the robotic arm to pick up and drink water, the system will add more autonomous intelligence, reduce the frequency of calibration and improve safety. Ultimately, we hope to establish China's leading position in the development of multi-degree-of-freedom brain control systems, and lay the foundation for subsequent clinical and industrialization.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-4-Research-on-brain-cognitive-model-alignment-mechanism\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-4-Research-on-brain-cognitive-model-alignment-mechanism\" title=\"3.4 Research on brain-cognitive-model alignment mechanism\"></a><strong>3.4 Research on brain-cognitive-model alignment mechanism</strong></h2><p><strong>Research Objectives: To explore the alignment mechanism between the cognitive representation of the human brain and the representation of the artificial intelligence model</strong>, construct a human-machine cognitive channel, and realize the semantic mapping between the knowledge/semantic space within the large model and the cognitive content carried by the brain signal. Through this study, we hope to answer: Can the representation of large-scale pre-trained AI models be used to better interpret and decode brain activity? Conversely, can cranial nerve signals provide unique cognitive constraints for AI models, so as to establish a two-way human-machine cognitive coupling system? This content will provide a theoretical basis and experimental verification for the information theory limit of brain-computer interface and brain-computer cooperative intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong>Research content and program:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Representation extraction of the cognitive layer of the large model: First, we need to obtain the representation of the corresponding \"cognitive layer\" in the large AI model. Taking large language models (LLMs) as an example, their high-level implied state vectors often carry rich contextual and semantic information, which can be regarded as the \"idea\" of the model</strong>. For example, when the GPT model processes a sentence, each layer of the Transformer has a hidden state, and we will focus on intercepting the hidden state of the last few layers as the \"Wisdom layer\" representation of the model. For the visual-linguistic multimodal model, we can take its representation of the cross-modal fusion layer, which is considered to contain a comprehensive understanding of the concept. This project will select appropriate AI models for tasks such as movement and language: in terms of language, we will select the open-source LLM with the best performance in Chinese, and in terms of vision/movement, we can choose some models with action semantic understanding capabilities (such as pre-trained video understanding models) or our self-trained models. By having these models process the same/similar task inputs as our experiments (e.g., the model reads the same text we play to the subject, or the model observes a video of the participant performing an action), the representation vectors inside the model are extracted as the coordinates of the AI cognitive space.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Mapping of brain signal space to cognitive space: The next core work is to learn a function f that maps the representation of brain nerve signals to the cognitive representation of the AI model, and possibly the inverse mapping g. This can be seen as looking for an alignment transformation between the brain space and the model space</strong>. On the one hand, we plan to use the method of aligned learning and representation mapping: on the one hand, we use samples with both brain data and corresponding semantic labels (e.g., after listening to a sentence, brain signal X corresponds to sentence semantic S, and the AI model obtains semantic representation V), to train a feedforward neural network f: X-&gt;V to minimize the gap between f(X) and V (e.g., mean square error); On the other hand, methods of zero-shot mapping are also explored, such as direct geometric alignment: it has been found that the semantic embedding space in the brain and the embedding space of the language model have similar patterns in geometric structure, and can be well coincident through linear mapping. We will try to perform principal component analysis or network training on the brain responses (e.g., neural embeddings of a series of words) and the word vectors of the language model to see if we can find a simple transformation to align the two points to prove the conformal geometry hypothesis. In addition to linearity, we will also introduce the idea of Deep Adversarial Network (GAN), where a mapper projects brain signals into the hidden space of the model, and the discriminator determines whether the projection is like the hidden vector of the real model, and the loop training approximation distribution is consistent.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Semantic alignment evaluation: To verify the alignment effect, we design several evaluation methods:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1) <strong>Retrieval matching accuracy</strong>: given a piece of brain signal (such as the signal of a sentence being listened to), the model space vector is obtained by mapping f, and then the most similar text vector is retrieved in the model corpus to see whether the first N candidates contain the correct sentence. This is similar to the zero-shot mapping validation method used in the previous Nature newsletter paper, which will prove whether brain embedding and model embedding share patterns.</p>\n<p>2) <strong>Decoding task performance</strong>: The mapped model representation is directly fed into the downstream tasks of the pre-trained model, such as Q&amp;A or translation, to see if the output conforms to the meaning that the subject wants to express. For example, if a participant looks at a picture and uses their brain to describe it, we map the brain signal to the language model space, and then let the language model generate the description text to evaluate whether it is close to the human description.</p>\n<p>3) <strong>Brain-computer collaborative task</strong>: design a task that needs to be completed by humans and AI, for example, AI generates a sentence at the beginning, and the user continues to think about the end in his mind, we decode the end and the AI determines whether it conforms to the semantics; Or ask the AI to guess which one the user is imagining in a number of images. Through the success rate of these interactive tasks, the usefulness of aligning channels is evaluated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Construction of human-computer two-way cognitive channel: On the basis of completing the brain-&gt; model mapping, we also try to build a model-&gt;brain reverse pathway, that is, a closed loop of brain-computer collaboration</strong>。 If the mapping g: V-&gt;X can be learned (e.g., using neurofeedback training, where the AI model adjusts the output to drive the user to produce a specific detectable brain signal pattern), it means that we can partially \"write\" information to the brain. We will be very cautious about this and limit ourselves to non-invasive, low-risk attempts, such as using visual/auditory feedback to get the user's brain into a known pattern. If the AI is able to adjust the presentation based on the monitored brain feedback (e.g., if the AI tries to synchronize a certain rhythm with the user's brain or causes the user to produce a specific resonant brainwave state), that would validate the possibility of bidirectional alignment. Of course, the main focus of this project is still on one-way decoding alignment, but we believe that reverse exploration will provide valuable clues for future Brain-AI symbiotic technologies.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Privacy and ethical considerations: Brain-model alignment raises potential concerns about brain privacy, as it may dig deeper into the semantic information contained in the brain. This study will be conducted under the premise of adhering to ethical norms, such as all participants signed informed consent, data anonymization, and analysis will only be done for specific task areas, and no personal intimate associations will be involved. We will also technically study the idea of cryptographic mapping, so as to avoid the misuse of the alignment model and restore the ideas that users do not want to share. These explorations will help establish privacy standards in the field of brain-computer interfaces.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expected Results: Through this content research, we hope to achieve the first domestic proof of the deep alignment of the semantic space of large models with the cognitive space of the human brain</strong>. Specifically, expected accomplishments include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>**Algorithm module: A semantic alignment algorithm module (software) that inputs signals such as EEG/MEG, outputs the corresponding large model hidden layer representation vector, and reversible coarse coding. We strive to make the module reach the international advanced level in testing on public datasets, such as achieving top results in public cross-modal brain-computer semantic alignment tasks. It is worth noting that some scholars have published the Chinese Semantic Aligned EEG Dataset (**ChineseEEG) for semantic alignment and neural decoding research. We will verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on this dataset and expect to improve the accuracy by &gt;10% compared with the existing methods.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Theoretical papers: Write and publish 1~2 high-level papers, systematically expound the implementation methods and experimental results of brain-cognitive-model alignment, analyze which dimensions of semantics are easy to align, which are difficult, and which layers of the large model are more similar to the human brain. These results will have an important impact at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Human-machine collaboration demonstration: show a simple example of human-computer semantic communication: for example, ask the subject to look at several pictures, describe one of them with brain imagination, and our system will decode and generate a text description, and the</strong> AI assistant will guess which picture it is. This demonstration will demonstrate the prototype of a new interaction model based on human-machine alignment.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Through this study, we will prospectively expand the connotation of brain-computer interface, from simple signal control to the integration of brain and AI knowledge. In the long run, the human brain and the AI \"brain\" will achieve deep synergy through the alignment channel we have laid, which will not only help the performance of brain-computer interfaces leap forward, but also provide valuable clues for understanding the unified mechanism of human and machine intelligence.</p>\n<h1 id=\"4-Feasibility-analysis\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-Feasibility-analysis\" title=\"4. Feasibility analysis\"></a><strong>4. Feasibility analysis</strong></h1><p>The project is led by Prof. Yucong Duan, whose team has a solid research foundation and rich resources in the fields of brain-computer interface, artificial intelligence and artificial consciousness, which provides a reliable guarantee for the smooth implementation of the project.</p>\n<p><strong>Research basis: Prof. Yucong Duan's team has long been committed to the proposal and improvement of the DIKWP model and artificial consciousness theory, and is an international leading team in this field. As the chairman of the World Conference on Artificial Consciousness</strong> and <strong>the director of the DIKWP International Standards Committee for Artificial Intelligence Assessment</strong>, Professor has led a number of research projects on artificial consciousness and has built a complete theoretical system. In terms of artificial consciousness hardware architecture, the team proposed the artificial consciousness processing unit (<strong>ACPU) architecture</strong>, which organically combines the subconscious computing unit, the conscious decision-making unit and the fusion unit, and realizes the prototype of artificial consciousness from theory to hardware design. This innovative work demonstrates the team's ability to translate complex consciousness theory into engineering implementation, which is an important precursor to the design of the brain control system (especially the consciousness module) of this project. At the same time, the team has also accumulated rich experience in the specific application of the DIKWP model: for example, the DIKWP model is used in the medical dialogue system to solve the problem of diagnostic disagreement, which significantly improves the system interpretation ability; Aiming at the problem of large model hallucination, the combination of DIKWP and chain thinking and other reasoning paths was explored. These studies provide inspiration and reference for us to apply DIKWP to brain signal decoding.</p>\n<p>In the direction of brain-computer interface and neural engineering, the team has also made a number of layouts and achievements in recent years. The project led by Prof. Yucong Duan has proposed the idea of integrating the DIKWP artificial consciousness model with a high spatiotemporal resolution ultrasound brain-computer interface to break through the bottleneck in the field of BCI. The idea has been preliminarily demonstrated, and a call for cooperation has been published on the scientific research network, indicating that the team is at the forefront of exploring new brain signal acquisition and decoding technologies. In addition, team members include experts with multidisciplinary backgrounds in computational neuroscience, pattern recognition, robotics engineering, and more. Among the core research backbones, there are not only PhDs with rich experience in EEG/brain imaging data analysis (who have participated in a national key R&amp;D program brain science project), but also young talents who are good at machine learning and large model applications (who have published papers on the association between large models and brain activity at the top meeting), and engineers who are proficient in embedded systems and robot control (who have participated in the research and development of medical robot products). Such a multidisciplinary team configuration enables us to collaborate on key problems from multiple perspectives such as brain science, artificial intelligence, and electronic engineering. The team has built a basic laboratory platform: equipped with a 128-channel EEG acquisition system, a functional near-infrared imager, virtual reality equipment, and a variety of peripheral prototypes such as robotic arms, myoelectric prosthetic hands, and lower limb exoskeletons, which initially meet the experimental needs of this project. Relying on this platform, the team has successfully demonstrated the experiment of using EEG signals to control a simple robotic arm to grasp the sphere, and won good results in the National College Student Brain Control Competition. Although these preliminary explorations are relatively simple, they provide valuable experience for us to carry out more complex brain control research (such as multi-channel signal noise reduction, triggering mechanism of asynchronous brain control commands, etc.).</p>\n<p><strong>Innovation ability: The team's innovation ability in theory and practice is outstanding, and the relevant papers published have been selected as hot spots for many times. In particular, new ideas such as \"consciousness bug theory\" and \"relational definition semantics\" proposed by Professor Yucong Duan have attracted attention in the academic community. In terms of AI assessment, the team developed the world's first large-scale model awareness level assessment method and released a white-box DIKWP assessment report to fill the gap in this field. These achievements demonstrate the team's ability to accurately grasp the frontier of science and technology and lead the way. For this project, we have the driving force from 0 to 1 innovation, and we are confident that we will integrate the new DIKWP × DIKWP ideas into the brain-computer interface, and realize the world's first artificial consciousness-guided brain control system</strong>. Initial simulations have shown that the feasibility is possible: our team's recent internal report shows that combining the DeepSeek large model with the DIKWP*DIKWP framework can significantly improve the efficiency of semantic interaction with multi-source heterogeneous data. This bodes well for the use of large models for semantic decoding of brain signals. More specifically, the team has a cooperation basis with a hospital rehabilitation center to jointly carry out <strong>electrical stimulation and rehabilitation research on spinal cord-peripheral nerve interface, and proposed a multi-parameter neuromodulation strategy integrating the DIKWP model. This project involves the electrical stimulation treatment of paraplegic patients, and the problems that need to be solved, such as cross-scale signal processing and closed-loop control, have similarities with the brain control system of this project. Therefore, we can share the research resources and results, such as neural signal processing algorithm modules, rehabilitation assessment methods, etc., to accelerate the progress of this project.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Resource conditions: The supporting unit of this project has the support of the national key laboratory platform and can provide the necessary equipment purchase and test sites. For example, the lab has a shielded room for EEG experiments and a robotic motion capture space for exoskeleton testing. In addition, we maintain cooperation and communication with top teams in many related fields: such as the Brain-like Computing Center of Tsinghua University (which provides guidance on multimodal brain signal processing), the Department of Neurosurgery of a tertiary hospital in Beijing (which supports the acquisition of cortical electrode data of some patients for research), and an AI company (which provides the latest large model API and computing power support). These industry-university-research partnerships will support the implementation of the project. In terms of capital and management, the relying unit has rich experience and can ensure the smooth progress of the project. A number of national-level projects undertaken by the team in the past have been completed on schedule and with high quality, forming an efficient organization and coordination mechanism. The project team members have a clear division of labor and work closely together, and will ensure that the research progress is carried out as planned through weekly meetings and stage acceptance.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Risk response: Although this project is challenging, the team has a plan: for the possible brain signal decoding effect is not as expected, we have prepared a variety of alternative algorithms and fusion schemes (such as adding electromyography signals as an aid to improve the recognition rate of motor purpose); For peripheral control security risks, we will arrange safety officers and emergency stop mechanisms in the experiment, and strictly limit the scenarios to gradually increase the complexity to ensure that no accidents occur. In addition, we will introduce rolling evaluations during project execution to</strong> adjust research priorities based on interim results to minimize risks.</p>\n<p>In summary, <strong>human-machine-consciousness integration is an emerging frontier direction, and</strong> Professor Yucong Duan's team has made long-term accumulation in this direction, bringing together the advantages of theory, technology and data, and has excellent feasibility in implementing this project. A strong interdisciplinary lineup and early results give us the confidence to achieve the set goals and make breakthroughs within the project cycle.</p>\n<h1 id=\"5-Phased-results-and-assessment-indicators\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#5-Phased-results-and-assessment-indicators\" title=\"5.

Particular emphasis is placed on the implementation of real-time decoding equipment for high-channel-count brain signals and the effectiveness of the DIKWP-guided intelligent brain control system, such as the number of automatic calibration of the decoding module according to the prompts of the DIKWP evaluation module in the closed-loop &lt; 1 time per day, which is significantly reduced compared with the conventional system.</p>\n<p>(3) Application module and demonstration: develop a semantic alignment algorithm module embedded in the system, so that it has preliminary brain semantic communication functions (such as simple text brain typing); Develop an artificial consciousness-driven EEG interaction module to improve the efficiency of user purpose expression in specific scenarios (for example, the system automatically increases sensitivity when the user is focused). These modules form functional components that can be handed over to a healthcare facility or enterprise.</p>\n<p>(4) Achievement condensation papers**/patents**: publish 1-2 systematic papers to summarize the system-wide R&amp;D experience and innovation points; Submitted more than 2 invention patents (involving brain-computer interface decoding algorithms, closed-loop control, etc.). *Assessment indicators: *Whether the functions of the brain control system are fully realized, and whether the indicators meet the requirements of the task book (such as success rate, delay, and number of adapted devices); whether the demonstration application has achieved the desired effect (e.g., a paralyzed person is able to operate a prosthesis to complete daily movements in a clinical trial); Whether the IP output is up to standard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition, during the implementation of the project, milestone review and other methods will be used to ensure that the stage goals are achieved. For example, the mid-term inspection requires the demonstration of at least one brain-controlled device operation, and the acceptance requires multi-device scenario demonstration and third-party test verification. The expected phased results of this project are not only a response to the assessment indicators, but also will lay the foundation for a new generation of brain-computer interface technology system in China: including high-channel number decoding hardware, a software platform that integrates artificial consciousness, and a complete set of application solutions. These results will be sorted out and reported at the end of the project, and released to the public in an appropriate way (such as holding a press conference or participating in the achievement exhibition organized by the Ministry of Science and Technology).</p>\n<h1 id=\"6-App-Conversion-Paths\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#6-App-Conversion-Paths\" title=\"6. App &amp; Conversion Paths\"></a><strong>6. App &amp; Conversion Paths</strong></h1><p>The research results of this project have broad application prospects and clear transformation paths, which can serve many fields such as rehabilitation medicine, human-computer collaboration, neuroprosthesis, and intelligent interaction, and provide core technical support for the development of related industries.</p>\n<p><strong>(1) Rehabilitation medicine: The high-precision brain control system will first play a direct role in rehabilitation medicine. For patients with high paraplegia, ALS, and other patients who have lost their ability to exercise or speak, our technology can provide a new channel of communication and regaining movement. For example, the brain-controlled robotic arm can assist paraplegic patients to complete daily activities such as independent feeding and personal care, greatly improving their ability to take care of themselves. The brain-controlled exoskeleton is expected to help some paraplegic patients regain standing and walk and achieve basic walking function training (preliminary practice at the University of Grenoble in France has proved the feasibility of quadriplegic patients walking with the help of the brain-controlled exoskeleton). Our system achieves similar functionality in a non-invasive way, which will lower the barrier to entry for clinical application and benefit more patients. At the same time, brain-language decoding technology can be used to construct ideotyping or ideographic speaking devices, allowing patients with aphasia or locked-in syndrome to \"speak\" their thoughts only through electrical activity in their brains. In this regard, Meta and the University of Texas have achieved early results, and our further Chinese semantic decoding is expected to be applied to communication aids for domestic patients. At the end of the project, we plan to jointly carry out a trial evaluation of a small sample of patients with partner hospitals, and provide prototypes such as brain-controlled prosthetic hands and brain-controlled input methods to target patients for trial for 1-2 weeks to collect clinical feedback. If the results are good, we will promote the medical device registration process and move towards commercialization. In terms of rehabilitation center applications, our high-channel brain-computer signal acquisition equipment and decoding software can upgrade the existing brain-computer training system, improve the accuracy and fun of training, and form a commercial rehabilitation training system</strong> (for example, for stroke patients' limb function reconstruction training, allowing patients to practice repeatedly through brain-controlled games). We expect that on the basis of the project results, we can incubate brain-controlled rehabilitation assistive products within 2-3 years, and cooperate with professional medical device companies to promote them to the market to meet the huge rehabilitation needs in China.</p>\n<p>**(2) Human-machine collaborative operation: The technology of this project can also be applied to human-machine collaborative operation in industry, service and other fields to improve efficiency and safety. For example, in hazardous environments (mines, firefighting, etc.), workers can remotely control robots or drones to complete tasks such as detection and operation without being in danger by wearing brain-computer interface devices, so as to ensure personal safety and improve the success rate of tasks. In high-precision manufacturing, experienced technicians can complete some ultra-precision assembly or operation through brain-controlled manipulators or collaborative robots - direct brain control can break through the physical limitations of traditional hand-eye coordination and achieve faster and more stable (because direct brain-computer communication is faster than hand movements, and AI-assisted can filter out human hand shaking). Even in the aerospace field, brain-computer interfaces allow terrestrial experts to remotely control robotic assistants on the space station through their minds, or allow astronauts to use their brains to control multiple robotic arms to work simultaneously while they are moving outside the cabin. Although these applications are still challenging from actual implementation, our research will provide the core module: highly reliable brain purpose decoding + multi-machine control. The human-machine cognitive alignment in the results of this project will also be used to improve the efficiency of human-machine collaboration—**AI can better predict human purpose and actively cooperate. For example, the Wisdom construction machinery of the future can automatically adjust the pace of work or take over some control when reading the operator's EEG stress or fatigue signals to avoid accidents. This <strong>purpose-aligned human-machine co-driving technology is very promising in the fields of intelligent driving and flight, and some automakers are already researching brainwave monitoring of the driver's status, and our more active human-computer interaction results will become a new technological growth point.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(3) Neuroprostheses and assistive devices: For amputees and people with disabilities, our brain-controlled high-freedom limb hands and prosthetic legs can greatly improve the quality of life. Traditional prostheses are mostly controlled by electromyography, which is expensive to learn and can only perform limited movements. Brain-controlled prostheses can be driven by brain ideas more naturally, and our AI prostheses can understand the user's purpose, such as grasping an egg with appropriate force without crushing it</strong> AI can be controlled with the assistance of visual sensing). The prosthetic control technology developed by the project can be integrated into the next generation of intelligent prosthetic products in cooperation with domestic prosthetic manufacturers. In addition, our brain-computer interface caps, consciousness communication devices, etc. can also enter the elderly care and care market as smart assistive devices. For example, brain-controlled smart home: the elderly with impaired mobility or aphasia can control the lights and electrical switches at home by wearing a brain computer headband, or call and communicate with caregivers through their minds, which is very convenient. In the later stage of the project, our team will connect with nursing homes and rehabilitation centers, try brain-controlled smart beds, brain-controlled wheelchairs and other equipment, collect demand feedback, and prepare for the finalization of the product. By co-building demonstration projects with industry partners, such as the Wisdom Home pilot, we will accelerate technology maturity and public acceptance.</p>\n<p><strong>(4) New human-computer intelligent interaction: The human brain-AI alignment channel of this project provides the possibility of direct brain interaction in the future. For example, combined with AR/VR technology, users can use their minds to manipulate avatars and communicate with virtual characters in virtual environments such as the metaverse by wearing BCI devices</strong> , achieving true \"exchange of ideas\". The semantic decoding module and alignment algorithm in our results can be used to develop application software such as brain-controlled input method and mind chat to meet the novel needs of the public in entertainment and communication. Imagine a video game in the future where players can control character movements and even release skills using only brain waves without a controller, which will be a new immersive experience. At present, there are preliminary explorations of brain-computer games, but most of them are limited to simple brainwave intensity control. Our high-precision decoding will make brain-computer games have the possibility of complex operations, and make a new blue ocean appear in the game industry. For example, in terms of text input, brain typing will greatly facilitate people with disabilities, and may also develop into a new trend of input methods for able-bodied people (especially when brain-computer devices are light enough). We will make the decoding algorithm API available to developers in the field of human-computer interaction, and give rise to more application scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Conversion path: In order to promote the implementation of the above applications, we have developed a clear conversion plan. First of all, in the process of project implementation, we will pay attention to the patent layout</strong>, and apply for patents in a timely manner for technologies with industrial value, such as \"brain-computer interface decoding method based on artificial consciousness\", \"brain signal-semantic alignment method\", \"multi-device brain control security mechanism\", etc., so as to lay an intellectual property foundation for future business cooperation. At the end of the project, it is planned to condense a set of software and hardware system solutions, including EEG acquisition hardware, AI decoding and awareness module software, application layer interface, etc., to form a prototype that can be commercialized. Next, we will seek cooperation with medical rehabilitation equipment manufacturers and high-tech companies to promote industrialization in the form of industry-university-research cooperation. For example, a rehabilitation device company that has been initially approached is very interested in our brain-controlled prosthetics technology and hopes to jointly develop smart prosthetics and apply for medical device certification; A start-up with brain-computer hardware mass production capabilities, such as a company like BrainCo, has expressed an interest in partnering to embed our decoding algorithms into its headband products to improve competitiveness. Our team is also considering incubating start-up companies independently, focusing on the development and service of brain-computer interface software platforms, and exporting our brain decoding capabilities to various industries in the form of software licensing or algorithm cloud services.</p>\n<p><strong>Standards and regulation: As an emerging industry, brain-computer interfaces also need standards and specifications. As a member of the relevant international standards committee, Professor Yucong Duan will take the lead in formulating group standards or guidelines for artificial consciousness brain-computer interface on the basis of the project, so as to ensure technical safety and controllability, ethical compliance, and escort the healthy development of the industry. At the same time, we pay close attention to regulatory developments, actively communicate with the national drug regulatory department about the review requirements of brain-computer interface medical products, and reserve security measures (such as data encryption and permission control) in the technical implementation to add points for future product approval.</strong></p>\n<p>In short, the transformation of the results of this project will be steadily promoted by the path of \"scientific research demonstration - clinical pilot - product incubation - standard guidance\". <strong>In the medium-term outlook of about 5 years, we strive to put a number of brain-controlled rehabilitation assistive devices into clinical use, and create a leading brain-computer interface brand or product line in China. In the longer term, the deep integration technology of human brain and artificial intelligence explored in this project is expected to give birth to</strong> a new concept of \"intelligence augmenting people\", and provide core technical reserves for the country to occupy a strategic commanding heights in the field of brain science and brain-like intelligence integration. We believe that through the implementation of this project, it will not only produce a series of academic innovations and engineering breakthroughs, but also directly promote the brain-computer interface from the laboratory to the clinic and industry, and make positive contributions to the construction of a healthy China and an intelligent society.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

With the aging of the population, the number of Parkinson's disease patients is growing rapidly, and the number of Parkinson's disease patients in China has exceeded 3 million, and it is expected to exceed 5 million in 2030 (about half of the total number of patients in the world). The prevalence of Parkinson's disease in the elderly population over 65 years old in China is about 1.7%, showing a significant upward trend with age. The high disability rate and irreversible progression of the disease place a heavy burden on patients' families and social healthcare systems.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the convergence of brain science and artificial intelligence has become a frontier field of global scientific and technological competition. National strategies such as the \"China Brain Plan\" clearly list brain-computer interface as a key development direction in the future, and brain-computer fusion technology is regarded as an important way to overcome neurological diseases such as paralysis and Parkinson's disease. At present, the treatment of Parkinson's disease is still mainly based on symptomatic remission, and there is a lack of fundamental intervention methods. In particular, the pathology of the neural circuit of the disease is complex, and how to adjust the brain function and alleviate the symptoms through external technical means is one of the major scientific challenges.</p>\n<p>In the existing treatments, drug therapies (e.g., levodopa replacement) are effective in controlling symptoms in the early stages, but long-term use is less effective and produces significant side effects; Surgical therapies such as Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) can significantly alleviate motor symptoms such as tremor in late Parkinson's disease, and are currently recognized as one of the effective interventions. However, none of these therapies have stopped disease progression and have limited improvement in the cause. In particular, traditional DBS usually adopts an open-loop continuous stimulation mode, which stimulates the target nuclei of the patient's brain for a long time under fixed parameters. This \"constant stimulation\" strategy cannot be adapted to the patient's real-time state, and often leads to overstimulation or understimulation, which induces side effects such as speech disorder and impulse control disorder. At the same time, the open loop stimulation cannot cope with the intraday fluctuations of Parkinson's symptoms, and there is still room for improvement in clinical efficacy. It is important to note that the neural mechanisms underlying why DBS can alleviate symptoms have not been fully elucidated. Some studies have compared brain connectivity before and after DBS treatment through imaging, and found that long-term stimulation can lead to the development of brain network topological reorganization in the direction of a healthy state. These suggests that external electrical stimulation may induce changes in the plasticity of the brain's neural circuits, thereby improving function. However, there is still a lack of systematic research on the specific brain regions and synaptic regulatory mechanisms involved in this remodeling process. This project aims at this scientific gap and uses Parkinson's disease as an example to deeply explore the phenomenon of brain-computer interface-induced brain circuit remodeling.</p>\n<p>In order to overcome the shortcomings of traditional loop-opening stimulation, researchers proposed the concept of adaptive deep brain stimulation (adaptive DBS) (aDBS), which dynamically adjusts stimulation parameters on demand based on closed-loop feedback, in order to improve symptoms and reduce side effects. Preliminary studies suggest that aDBS has the potential to control Parkinson's symptoms more precisely; However, there are still many challenges in this field, such as the limitations of the reliability of effective biofeedback indicators (brain signaling biomarkers), as well as the optimization complexity and clinical applicability of stimulus control strategies. According to the consensus of leading experts, aDBS needs to be deeply integrated with emerging technologies (such as artificial intelligence) to achieve large-scale application. However, the current knowledge and verification in this direction is still insufficient, and in-depth research is still needed to break through the bottleneck.</p>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that at present, some companies have launched DBS devices with EEG signal perception functions (such as Medtronic's Percept PC), and start-ups such as Neuralink have tried to develop brain-computer interface chips with high channel count. However, these initial explorations are still far from truly intelligent closed-loop regulation, and they do not yet have the ability to perform high-level semantic understanding and purpose decision-making on neural signals. The artificial consciousness closed-loop scheme proposed in this project will be innovative at this level, giving brain-computer interfaces \"self-awareness\" like regulatory wisdom.</p>\n<p>In order to further improve the intelligence level of closed-loop brain-computer regulation, we introduce the DIKWP artificial consciousness model proposed by Professor Yucong Duan as a theoretical basis. The DIKWP model adds the highest level of \"Purpose\" to the classical DIKW (Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom) cognitive level, forming a five-layer cognitive system of \"Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom-Purpose\". This extension emphasizes the central role of decision-making goals in the cognitive process of agents, and realizes two-way feedback and iterative update of semantic information at all layers through the establishment of a network structure. With the DIKWP model, AI systems can be clearly motivated, making every step of the decision-making process traceable and explainable. Compared with traditional black-box algorithms, this embedded \"purpose\"-oriented artificial consciousness framework is expected to make closed-loop neuromodulation more intelligent, adaptive, safe and controllable. For example, artificial consciousness can understand the purpose of \"relieving the patient's tremor\" and can actively adjust the stimulation parameters; And with interpretable semantic feedback, doctors understand the rationale for each adjustment. This cognitive model of human-computer integration will greatly improve the effectiveness and credibility of brain-computer interface intervention.</p>\n<p>It should be pointed out that there is no mature \"artificial consciousness + implantable brain-computer\" device at home and abroad for direct reference, and this project will carry out research under the condition of no pre-clinical equipment basis, with theoretical and algorithm innovation as the core driving force, and explore a new path of brain-computer fusion intervention. Although this process from 0 to 1 is challenging, it will also fully reflect the original innovation value of the project and provide important support for the realization of the goals of key projects.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Scientific-issues\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Scientific-issues\" title=\"Scientific issues\"></a><strong>Scientific issues</strong></h1><p>In response to the above background and challenges, this project intends to delve into the following key scientific questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Mechanism of Brain Circuit Remodeling</strong>: How Does Long-term Implantable Brain-Computer Fusion Intervention Affect and Reshape the Neural Circuit Function in Parkinson's Disease-Related Brain Regions? In particular, how does exogenous electrical stimulation induce plasticity changes in neurotransmitter regulation (at the microscopic level) and brain network connectivity (at the macroscopic level) to achieve improvement in motor symptoms? At present, little is known about this mechanism, and quantitative studies need to be elucidated.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Functional Semantic Modeling and Interaction Mapping</strong>: How to Construct a Semantic Model of Brain Region Functions and Realize Goal-Driven Semantic Interaction Mapping of Brain Regions? That is, can the patterns of neural activity in various functional areas of the brain be described with interpretable semantic features and mapped to therapeutic goals (e.g., tremor relief, improved motor performance)? How can the activities of different brain regions synergize with the semantic representation corresponding to specific motor functions or symptoms to guide the artificial consciousness to carry out targeted intervention and regulation?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Closed-loop control of artificial consciousness</strong>: How does an agent based on the DIKWP artificial consciousness model form a closed-loop interaction with the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease? Specifically, how can artificial consciousness obtain state information from the cranial nerve signals recorded by implanted electrodes, and obtain the optimal stimulation parameter scheme through the multi-level inference feedback of \"data-information-knowledge-wisdom-purpose\"? How does this closed-loop system achieve adaptive learning, adjust stimulation strategies based on long-term effects, and ensure the stability and safety of the system in complex and changing physiological environments?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Multi-objective Response and Predictability</strong>: Is the Impact of Artificial Conscious Intervention on Brain Functional Behavior Predictable and Quantifiable? In the face of multiple symptom targets of Parkinson's disease (such as simultaneous control of tremor and muscle rigidity), how can closed-loop intervention achieve multi-objective synergistic regulation, and what are its action pathways and interaction mechanisms? Is it possible to establish models or indicators to predict the evolution of symptoms after artificial consciousness intervention, evaluate potential side effects, and optimize intervention strategies accordingly, so that the system can take care of the main symptoms without introducing new functional impairments?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Chip-based implementation and system integration</strong>: How to turn the DIKWP artificial consciousness model into an implantable neurointervention chip and system prototype? In the absence of a ready-made clinical device foundation, what engineering and technical difficulties (such as real-time signal processing, low power consumption, high security, etc.) need to be overcome in order to organically combine artificial awareness algorithms with implantable hardware? How to design the entire system integration scheme to take into account the practical requirements such as volume and power consumption limitations, wireless communication, and safety isolation, and ensure that the developed prototype has the basis for further preclinical research?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"Research-objectives-and-content\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-objectives-and-content\" title=\"Research objectives and content\"></a><strong>Research objectives and content</strong></h1><p>The overall goal of this project is to <strong>elucidate the remodeling mechanism of the cranial neural circuit in Parkinson's disease under long-term implantable brain-computer fusion intervention, and to develop an intelligent closed-loop neuromodulation system based on the DIKWP artificial consciousness model</strong>. Focusing on this goal, the research content of the project mainly includes the following five aspects:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Functional semantic modeling of brain regions and goal-driven interaction mapping of brain regions</strong>: Functional semantic modeling is carried out for key brain regions related to motor regulation in Parkinson's disease, such as the thalamus, motor cortex, and basal ganglion nuclei in the basal ganglia circuit. By collecting and analyzing neural signals and behavioral data from these brain regions, the semantics of the physiological functions they represent (e.g., motor purpose or pathological state corresponding to different oscillation frequency bands) can be extracted. On this basis, the methodology of the DIKWP model was introduced to establish the semantic interaction mapping relationship between the semantic representations of each brain region and the specific motor function goals. This will shed light on how activity patterns in different brain regions correlate to the semantic goals of motor control, and how this association can be used to achieve goal-driven regulation of neural circuits. For example, patients with Parkinson's disease have abnormally increased activity in the low-β band (approximately 13–20 Hz) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and are thought to be biomarkers of bradykinesia and muscle stiffness in dopamine-deficient states. We assign similar neural signal patterns to corresponding semantic labels (such as \"motor inhibition signals\") to establish the mapping relationship between pathological states and functional goals, and guide artificial consciousness to carry out targeted regulation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>DIKWP Model-Driven Closed-loop Inference Feedback and Adaptive Neural Regulation</strong>: Design an artificial consciousness control algorithm to embed the DIKWP model into the closed-loop brain-computer system. Specifically, a set of artificial consciousness decision-making engines was developed to enable the extraction of \"data-information-knowledge-wisdom\" multi-level features from the neural signals recorded by the implanted electrodes, and combined with the \"Purpose\" module at the top level (e.g., for the purpose of alleviating specific symptoms) to evaluate and inferentially feedback the current pathological state of Parkinson's disease. In terms of signal decoding, deep learning and other methods will be explored to extract reliable information and knowledge features from raw neural data. In terms of decision optimization, adaptive algorithms such as reinforcement learning are introduced to enable artificial consciousness to continuously improve stimulus strategies based on closed-loop feedback. The artificial consciousness engine will generate adaptive stimulation parameters (such as current intensity, frequency, pulse pattern, etc.) in real time, and feed the stimulation signals back to the target brain region through the implanted device, forming a closed-loop regulatory mechanism. At the same time, the self-learning mechanism is studied, so that the artificial consciousness system can continuously adjust internal knowledge and strategies according to the feedback of efficacy, so as to achieve closed-loop learning optimized over time. This part will produce a set of interpretable closed-loop control algorithms for artificial consciousness, which can realize intelligent and adaptive control of neurostimulation and ensure that every step of decision-making is evidence-based.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Multi-layer network modeling of brain regions and simulation of artificial consciousness intervention and regulation</strong>: Constructing a brain model of Parkinson's disease covering the microscopic neuron and macroscopic brain network levels. On the one hand, neurotransmitter dynamics (such as the modulation of dopamine in the basal ganglia circuit) and synaptic plasticity rules are simulated at the microscopic level to characterize the abnormal activity pattern of neural circuits in Parkinson's disease. On the other hand, at the macro level, the topology and network dynamics model of brain region connectivity were established to reproduce the differences between normal and pathological brain functional networks. In this multi-level model, the artificial consciousness regulation module is introduced to simulate the intervention process of DIKWP artificial consciousness in the brain network: how the neural activity in the model responds and reorganizes when the artificial consciousness emits a specific stimulus pattern. Through simulation experiments, we will observe how long-term artificial consciousness intervention can lead to the remodeling of network structure and function, such as the change of synchronous oscillation mode, the improvement of network efficiency, or the suppression of abnormal rhythms. During the simulation, we will test a variety of closed-loop stimulus paradigms (e.g., periodic stimulus, event-triggered stimulus, etc.) to quantify changes in network synchronization, discharge frequency distribution, information transfer efficiency, and other indicators to identify key features of loop remodeling. In particular, we looked at the presence of changes such as a decrease in the intensity of abnormal β oscillations, an increase in the efficiency of effective connections, and assessed the association of these changes with symptom improvement. This study will provide a quantitative basis for understanding how AI intervention induces brain network plasticity, and reveal the mechanism of circuit remodeling behind the improvement of Parkinson's disease symptoms.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Non-human primate simulation verification and multi-objective response analysis</strong>: Non-human primate (such as Parkinson's disease monkey model) experiments or high-fidelity simulation platform (Parkinson's disease monkey model can be obtained by neurotoxin MPTP induction) to verify and predict the artificial consciousness intervention strategy. Design experimental tasks in which a closed-loop stimulation system driven by artificial consciousness intervenes in the motor regulation processes of the primate model, such as inhibiting limb tremor or improving gait motor coordination in real time. During the experiment, multi-dimensional outcome indicators (<strong>multi-objective) were monitored</strong>, including changes in motor symptom scores, physiological signal characteristics, and cognitive/affective side effects. By comparing and analyzing animal behavior and neural activity before and after artificial consciousness intervention, we evaluated the response effect of the closed-loop system to different symptom targets and their interaction pathways. Focus on the predictability of the effect of artificial consciousness intervention: can the simulation model predict the trajectory of symptoms after intervention? For multi-objective control (e.g., simultaneous control of tremor and muscle rigidity), can artificial consciousness coordinate and optimize each indicator without compromising the other? This section will verify the effectiveness and safety of artificial consciousness intervention in complex real-life physiological environments, and provide a basis for subsequent clinical applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Prototype of DIKWP Artificial Consciousness Chip-driven Implantable Neural Intervention System</strong>: Based on the above theoretical and model research, a prototype of artificial consciousness closed-loop neural intervention technology was developed. Development of a dedicated DIKWP Artificial Consciousness Processing Unit (<strong>ACPU</strong>). The artificial consciousness decision-making algorithm is implemented on the hardware platform to meet the stringent requirements of implantable applications for real-time performance and low power consumption. The implantable neurostimulation system is designed, including modules such as multi-channel electrode array and cortical implant interface, and the ACPU chip is embedded in the body device to realize the recording of nerve signals targeting the brain region and the precise stimulation output. At the system control level, the semantic plasticity control mechanism of electrode parameters is introduced, which allows the stimulation parameters to be dynamically adjusted with the update of artificial consciousness knowledge, so as to ensure that the stimulation mode after long-term implantation has the ability to adapt to evolve. At the same time, a closed-loop monitoring module of explainable algorithms at the target level was constructed to interpret and review the safety of artificial consciousness decisions (for example, the semantic basis for each stimulus adjustment was given to avoid abnormal output). In addition, we will develop a basic software system (similar to the Artificial Consciousness Operating System, ACOS) of the artificial consciousness chip, which is used to coordinate the operation of each functional module of the chip and the flow of semantic information, and embed a security monitoring mechanism to ensure that the system behavior is controllable and monitorable. Bench tests and preliminary animal experiments were conducted to verify the functional feasibility and safety of the prototype system. The development of this prototype will lay the foundation for the subsequent development of clinical brain-computer fusion devices, and reflect the exemplary value of this project in promoting technological progress with algorithm and architecture innovation in the absence of off-the-shelf equipment.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"Key-technical-difficulties-and-solutions\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Key-technical-difficulties-and-solutions\" title=\"Key technical difficulties and solutions\"></a><strong>Key technical difficulties and solutions</strong></h1><p>In the process of realizing this project, a number of key technical difficulties need to be overcome. For each difficulty, we propose the following solutions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Semantic problem of brain signals</strong>: The nerve signals in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease are complex and changeable, and how to convert massive and noisy neural data into semantic information with clear physiological significance is a major challenge. For example, multi-channel EEG/local field potential signals are often mixed with EMG artifacts and environmental noise, and advanced signal processing and pattern recognition techniques must be applied to extract useful information. It is difficult to directly extract the correspondence between the oscillation frequency and discharge pattern of different brain regions and the motor purpose or symptom state. <strong>Solution</strong>: Using multimodal data fusion and semantic modeling technology, the hierarchical cognitive framework of the DIKWP model is used to abstract brain signals step by step (extracting information and knowledge from raw data, and then rising to Wisdom and Purpose). Specifically, through time-frequency analysis, machine learning classification and other methods, stable feature patterns were extracted from the original neural signals. Combined with the knowledge graph related to Parkinson's disease, these patterns were assigned physiological semantic labels to construct a functional semantic dictionary of brain regions. Then, with the goal of improving specific symptoms, the mapping relationship between brain signal features and treatment goals was aligned to form a \"signal pattern-semantics-target\" correspondence framework. In this way, the artificial consciousness system can read the \"semantic signals\" of the brain and achieve a high-level understanding of the state of the brain.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Stability and adaptability of closed-loop control</strong>: Closed-loop neuromodulation based on artificial consciousness requires algorithms to analyze brain states in real time and dynamically adjust stimuli in milliseconds. In a complex and volatile physiological environment, the algorithm must remain stable without out-of-control oscillations or long decision delays. How to ensure the stable convergence and rapid response of the long-term operation of the closed-loop system is a major technical difficulty. <strong>Solution</strong>: The \"dual circulation\" architecture of DIKWP × DIKWP is introduced to add a metacognitive monitoring loop in addition to the main cycle of artificial consciousness decision-making. The main circulation evaluates the brain state and stimulates decision-making in real time, and the meta-circulation supervises and reflects on the output of the main circulation, discovers abnormalities in time and adjusts internal parameters, so as to achieve stable control under self-monitoring. At the same time, by setting up the reward and punishment mechanism and introducing the reinforcement learning algorithm, the artificial consciousness can continuously optimize the stimulation strategy in the closed-loop interaction. Safety constraints are imposed in the algorithm, such as limiting the rate and amplitude of change in stimulus parameters to avoid violent oscillations. In addition, asynchronous parallel processing is adopted in the system implementation to improve the decision-making throughput and ensure real-time performance. A multi-pronged approach ensures that the closed-loop control not only has adaptive optimization capabilities, but also always maintains a safe and stable working range.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Multi-scale brain model accuracy</strong>: Accurate multi-scale brain models are required to simulate the effects of artificial consciousness intervention on brain circuits. However, the brain spans multiple levels from a single neuron to a brain region network, with a large number of parameters and a wide range of distributions, and large individual differences (such as synaptic connection strength, dopamine concentration, etc., which are difficult to accurately measure), and it is extremely challenging to establish a model that can be close to real physiology. <strong>Solution</strong>: Adopt the method of hierarchical modeling and step-by-step verification to reduce complexity. Firstly, a local neural circuit model was constructed based on the literature and experimental data to simulate the microscopic pathology of Parkinson's disease (such as the imbalance of excitation/inhibition of the basal ganglia pathway caused by dopamine deficiency), and to verify whether the model can reproduce the known abnormal discharge patterns. Then, the local model was integrated into a macroscopic brain network model, and the anatomical connection data was fused to reproduce the interactive behavior of multiple brain regions of the brain, and the model parameters were adjusted through the electrophysiological data of the existing Parkinson's animal model, so that the output of the model was consistent with the characteristics of the real brain network. On the built model, the artificial consciousness algorithm was introduced for simulation intervention, and the key parameters or mechanism assumptions in the model were continuously revised by comparing the simulation results with experimental observations, so as to improve the credibility of the model prediction. At the same time, the sensitivity analysis of the model parameters is carried out to quantify the uncertainty range to ensure the robustness of the simulation conclusions. Through such cyclic iterations, the real situation is gradually approximated, so that the model is not only biologically rational, but also can provide guidance for algorithm optimization.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Artificial consciousness chip and implantation technology difficulties</strong>: The implementation of complex artificial consciousness algorithm into an implantable hardware system needs to solve a series of engineering problems such as limited computing resources, power consumption control, heat dissipation, and biocompatibility. At present, there is no special chip or implant device for artificial consciousness that can be directly used, and everything needs to be developed from scratch. <strong>Solution</strong>: Adopt a combination of ASIC ASIC design or FPGA prototyping. First, build a prototype on the FPGA to verify the function and performance of the artificial consciousness algorithm, and then design the ASIC after the algorithm is mature to reduce the risk of repeated tape-out. The chip architecture is designed to optimize parallel computing and storage access, and use fixed-point computing and model compression to reduce power consumption. The package design is designed in collaboration with the medical engineering team to develop a stable and reliable implantable electrode interface using highly biocompatible materials and miniaturized packaging to ensure long-term implantation safety. In addition, the tissue reactions that may be triggered by long-term electrode implantation (such as signal attenuation due to gliosis) should be fully considered, and mitigation measures should be taken in terms of materials and structures. Through rigorous fatigue testing and environmental simulation, it ensures the reliability of the hardware in the body for long-term operation. In case of lagging behind the chip R&amp;D progress, the preparatory plan is to use in vitro equipment to simulate the chip function in the short term to ensure that the overall research does not stop.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>System security and algorithm controllability</strong>: There is a safety risk for \"artificial consciousness\" to directly intervene in the patient's brain, and it is necessary to ensure that the system decision-making is reliable and there is no dangerous output. Especially in the absence of unprecedented equipment to refer to, how to prove that the algorithm is safe and effective is critical to the success of the project. <strong>Solution</strong>: Introduce explainability constraints and hierarchical monitoring mechanisms at the algorithm level. Every step of the decision is accompanied by an explainable basis, which is reviewed by the monitoring module, eliminating completely agnostic black box operations. At the same time, multiple levels of safety protection are set up, such as triggering an emergency shutdown or switching to a safe mode (e.g., resuming a preset fixed stimulus) when abnormal brain activity is detected or the algorithm output is out of bounds. During the implementation of the project, experiments were carried out step by step: a large number of offline data analysis and simulation were carried out to verify the algorithm behavior, then small-scale animal experiments were carried out to evaluate the safety, and finally the experimental scope was expanded with the support of sufficient evidence. The project team will also work closely with ethics experts and clinicians to develop detailed risk plans and emergency response procedures. In the event of an unforeseen situation, activate the plan immediately to minimize the risk. Through the above measures, the safety and controllability of the closed-loop system of artificial consciousness can be ensured to the greatest extent, and a reliable foundation will be laid for possible clinical trials in the future.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"Technical-route\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Technical-route\" title=\"Technical route\"></a><strong>Technical route</strong></h1><p>The project is progressing gradually according to the technical path of \"theoretical research→ simulation verification→ prototype development\", and each research task is connected with each other and iteratively optimized to form a closed-loop R&amp;D process. Firstly, the semantic representation of brain function in Parkinson's disease was obtained through semantic modeling of brain regions, which laid a knowledge foundation for subsequent intervention. On this basis, a closed-loop control algorithm driven by DIKWP artificial consciousness was developed to endow the system with the ability of independent analysis and decision-making. Then, the algorithm was simulated and tested in a multi-level brain network model, and the brain circuit effect of artificial consciousness intervention was predicted and evaluated, and the algorithm parameters and model assumptions were optimized accordingly. Next, the optimized artificial consciousness closed-loop system was introduced into the non-human primate experimental platform for verification, the system performance and safety were investigated in the real biological system, and the experimental results were used to improve the model and algorithm. Finally, the development and integration of artificial consciousness chip and implantable intervention system were completed, and the overall system function was verified through bench tests and animal experiments. The whole technical route guides practice with theory and corrects theory with experiments, gradually reduces research risks, ensures the coherence of the results of each stage of the project, and finally achieves the expected goals of the project.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Phased-task-scheduling\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Phased-task-scheduling\" title=\"Phased task scheduling\"></a><strong>Phased task scheduling</strong></h1><p>In order to ensure the orderly implementation of the project, we will proceed gradually in stages, and the specific plan is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Phase 1 (Year 1-2):</strong> Focus on basic theories and key models. Completed the functional semantic modeling of the brain region of Parkinson's disease, and constructed the semantic database of the brain region (including the functional semantic definition of the relevant brain region of Parkinson's disease) and the preliminary interaction mapping model of the brain region (corresponding to research content 1). A prototype of a closed-loop control algorithm for artificial consciousness was developed in parallel to realize the neural signal decoding and stimulation parameter generation of typical scenarios (such as simulated tremor) in a simulated environment (corresponding to research content 2). At the end of the stage, the preliminary results of the semantic model of the cerebral circuit of Parkinson's disease and the decision-making algorithm of artificial consciousness were produced, and one paper was written and the invention patent was applied for. The first stage lays the theoretical and methodological foundation of the project.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Phase 2 (Year 3–4):</strong> Focus on simulation validation and system optimization. The artificial consciousness algorithm developed in the first stage was embedded in the multi-level brain network model, and large-scale simulation experiments were carried out on the computer to analyze the impact of artificial consciousness intervention on the dynamic characteristics of the brain circuit, verify the hypothesis of brain circuit remodeling, and improve the algorithm accordingly (corresponding to the research content 3). At the same time, preliminary validation was carried out on the non-human primate experimental platform: the MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease monkey model was selected, the artificial consciousness closed-loop stimulation system was introduced to test the effect of real-time control of tremor and other symptoms, and multi-objective response data were collected (corresponding to the research content 4). Combined with the simulation and experimental results, the parameters and models of the artificial consciousness algorithm are optimized, so that the system has good robustness and generalization. In the second stage, it is expected to publish 2 research papers, forming an in-depth understanding of the brain-computer fusion remodeling mechanism and a set of optimized closed-loop control algorithms, so as to prepare for the development of prototypes.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Phase 3 (Year 5):</strong> Focus on system integration and prototyping. The DIKWP artificial consciousness chip was developed and the prototype of the implantable neural intervention system was built, including electrode array, signal acquisition/stimulation module, wireless communication and power management (corresponding to research content 5). Complete the chip tape-out or FPGA implementation, integrate the software and hardware systems, and debug repeatedly. The performance of the prototype system was then evaluated in animal experiments: focusing on long-term implantation stability, biocompatibility, and the efficacy and safety of closed-loop stimulation for symptom improvement. According to the test results, the system design is improved and finalized, and the principle prototype and technical report of the artificial consciousness brain-computer fusion intervention system are finally delivered. In the third stage, it is planned to publish 1-2 papers, apply for 1-2 related patents, and comprehensively summarize the project results. The completion of this phase marks the achievement of the project goals and lays a solid foundation for subsequent preclinical research and application translation.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"Composition-of-the-research-team\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Composition-of-the-research-team\" title=\"Composition of the research team\"></a><strong>Composition of the research team</strong></h1><p>This project is composed of multidisciplinary experts with rich experience in the intersection of artificial intelligence and brain science, and the team has the comprehensive R&amp;D capabilities required to complete this project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Project Leader: Prof. Yucong Duan</strong> (Supported by the Active Medicine Committee of the World Association of Artificial Consciousness) – Project Leader, the proposer of the DIKWP Theory of Artificial Consciousness.

This complementary and well-organized team will provide a strong guarantee for the smooth implementation of the project.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Risk-assessment-and-contingency-plans\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Risk-assessment-and-contingency-plans\" title=\"Risk assessment and contingency plans\"></a><strong>Risk assessment and contingency plans</strong></h1><p>This project is highly innovative, but also accompanied by certain technical risks. We have a comprehensive plan for potential risks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>The effect of the algorithm is not as expected</strong>: The closed-loop algorithm of artificial consciousness may not achieve the expected effect in the actual complex brain signal environment, and even make mistakes in decision-making. <em>Planning</em>: Develop multiple sets of algorithm options (such as signal decoding and control strategies based on different models) in advance, and select the best performers through simulation and small-sample experiments. Once an algorithm does not work well in subsequent experiments, it will quickly switch to an alternative. At the same time, expert advisors are introduced to regularly evaluate the output of the algorithm, and the results are manually verified to prevent systematic deviations, and the algorithm parameters are continuously adjusted according to the feedback until they are stable and reliable.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Models do not match reality</strong>: Simulation models may not fully reproduce the response of real brains to stimuli, resulting in predictions that are inconsistent with actual experiments. <em>Planning</em>: Adopt the \"modeling-experiment\" iterative method to continuously revise the model with new experimental data. If the key parameters of the model are found to be inaccurate, the model structure or parameter distribution should be adjusted immediately based on the experimental results. When necessary, data-driven black-box models are introduced to replace the parts that are difficult to model and improve the overall simulation accuracy. If certain hypotheses (e.g., specific plasticity mechanisms) are falsified, the theoretical framework should be updated in time to ensure that the research direction is flexibly adjusted and not confined to the original model.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Delays in hardware development or insufficient performance</strong>: Technical difficulties may be encountered during the development of artificial awareness chips or implantable devices, resulting in lagging progress or performance substandard (such as excessive power consumption and excessive size). <em>Preliminary plan</em>: Adopt modular parallel R&amp;D, give priority to the verification of key functional modules, and then integrate and optimize to shorten the R&amp;D path. Develop a detailed R&amp;D milestone plan, closely monitor each node, and identify and resolve issues in a timely manner. If the ASIC development is not completed in time, we will consider replacing it with FPGAs or existing wearable devices in the short term to complete the experimental verification and continue to optimize the ASIC design. In terms of resource allocation, funds and manpower are reserved to meet the sudden needs of technical research and ensure that hardware research and development are generally controllable.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Uncertainty in animal experiments</strong>: Experimental results in primate models of Parkinson's disease may vary greatly from person to person, or with unforeseen safety issues (e.g., unexpected conditions in animals). <em>Preliminary plan</em>: Strictly follow the ethical requirements of animal experiments, first conduct low-dose and safe tests on a small number of experimental animals, observe their behavior and physiological changes, and then gradually expand the sample and stimulation intensity after confirming safety. Establish an emergency plan, such as stopping the stimulation immediately and intervening to properly treat the animal if it is found to be experiencing severe discomfort or abnormal behavior. At the same time, prepare alternative protocols: if primate experiments are blocked, consider turning to rodents for partial validation, or utilizing ex vivo brain slice/organoid experiments to obtain validation data to reduce reliance on a single model. Through multi-channel data acquisition, ensure that key scientific questions are supported by validation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Risk of multidisciplinary collaboration</strong>: The project involves multiple fields such as artificial intelligence, neuromedicine, and electronic engineering, and the team members have different backgrounds, making it difficult to communicate collaboratively and coordinate schedules. <em>Plan</em>: Establish a standardized project management and communication mechanism. Hold regular plenary meetings and symposia to unify technical roadmaps and terminology. The project leader will take the lead, and the person in charge of each sub-project will be responsible for daily coordination, and a special person will be designated to track the progress. Introduce project management tools to manage tasks on Gantt charts, identify delays and adjust resources in a timely manner. If there is a change in team members, quickly use the back-up talent or recruit new members to fill the staff. Through the above measures, the project team can be operated efficiently and collaboratively, and the risk of delays caused by poor communication will be reduced.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"Expected-outcomes-and-translatable-application-value\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Expected-outcomes-and-translatable-application-value\" title=\"Expected outcomes and translatable application value\"></a><strong>Expected outcomes and translatable application value</strong></h1><p>Through the implementation of the project, we expect to achieve the following results and create significant application value:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Theoretical breakthrough</strong>: elucidate the mechanism of long-term implantable brain-computer interface on the remodeling of brain circuits in Parkinson's disease, and enrich the scientific understanding of neuroplasticity in movement disorders. This theoretical progress will fill the international gap in the research on brain-computer fusion-induced brain plasticity, and is expected to be published in top journals in the field of brain science or neural engineering, providing a solid foundation for subsequent related research and theoretical guidance for the formulation of more effective intervention strategies.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Innovation of artificial consciousness model</strong>: The DIKWP artificial consciousness model was successfully applied to the field of neuromodulation, and an artificial consciousness algorithm framework for brain-computer interface was proposed. The framework realizes the closed-loop control of the whole process of AI from \"perception-cognition-decision-purpose\", and can be traced and explained for each step of operation. This not only verifies the effectiveness of the DIKWP model in complex biological systems, but also provides a new idea for solving the current \"black box\" problem of AI systems and improving the interpretability of AI decisions, which can be further extended to other AI medical scenarios and promote the development of AI towards a higher level of autonomy and security.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Key technologies and prototype systems</strong>: The principle prototype of the implantable neural intervention system driven by the DIKWP artificial consciousness chip was developed. The prototype has the ability to autonomously perceive the pathological state and dynamically adjust the stimulus, which is expected to achieve effective relief of Parkinson's symptoms in animal experiments. It is expected to apply for more than 3 domestic and foreign invention patents, form independent intellectual property rights, and lay a technical foundation for the development of a new generation of intelligent brain pacemaker in China. This move will enhance China's independent innovation strength in the field of high-end medical devices, reduce dependence on imported equipment, and inject impetus into the development of related industries.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Papers, patents, and talent training</strong>: During the implementation of the project, it is expected to publish more than 5 papers in international authoritative journals (at least 3 of which are included in SCI) to enhance China's academic influence in the interdisciplinary field of artificial intelligence and brain-computer interface; At the same time, it has applied for 3-5 domestic and foreign invention patents to ensure the intellectual property protection of core technologies. In addition, through the practice of the project, a number of young scientific research talents such as doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows will be trained, and an interdisciplinary team proficient in brain-computer integration and artificial intelligence will be trained, providing a valuable talent reserve for the sustainable development of this field in China.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Application prospects</strong>: The results of this project have important potential value in clinical and industrial fields. For patients with Parkinson's disease, the intelligent closed-loop stimulation system based on artificial consciousness is expected to provide a more refined and efficient symptom management method, reduce the dosage of drugs and side effects while reducing motor symptoms, and improve the quality of life of patients. This technology can also be extended to other neurological diseases, such as essential tremor, epilepsy, depression and other diseases that require brain stimulation treatment, so as to achieve a safer and more personalized treatment plan. From an industrial point of view, the new paradigm of \"artificial consciousness + brain-computer interface\" explored in this project will lead the new direction of medical AI and neuromodulation technology, and is expected to give birth to a new generation of high-end medical device products, forming China's first-mover advantage in this field. The research results will also lay a solid foundation for follow-up clinical translational research (such as human clinical trials), ultimately provide cutting-edge scientific and technological support for the construction of \"Healthy China\", and promote the coordinated development of brain science and brain-like intelligence in China.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>"

On the one hand, the brain-computer interface (BCI), as a bridge between the human brain and external devices, shows great potential to expand human intelligence and rehabilitate neural functions. Internationally, scientific research teams and enterprises represented by Neuralink and others are investing heavily in high-throughput brain signal acquisition and decoding technology, and the global brain-computer interface market has exceeded 2 billion US dollars, with a compound annual growth rate of about 17.5%, and the total market size is expected to exceed 6 billion US dollars around 2030. On the other hand, China has listed brain science and brain-like research as a major project of scientific and technological innovation 2030, focusing on the principles of brain cognition, intervention of major brain diseases, brain-inspired computing and brain-computer intelligence technology. \"Research on brain signal recording technology\" is a key topic in this national strategic deployment, which is related to China's independent innovation and competitive advantage in the field of new generation artificial intelligence and biomedical engineering.</p>\n<p>However, there are still many challenges in the acquisition and decoding of brain signals: <strong>(1) signal acquisition bottleneck</strong>: non-invasive EEG signals are susceptible to noise interference and have limited spatial resolution; Invasive electrodes have high signal quality, but they have safety risks and ethical limitations. <strong>(2) Decoding the semantic gap</strong>: Traditional brain-computer interfaces mostly use data-driven pattern recognition methods, which directly map EEG waveforms to simple instructions, which lack the understanding of the deep connection between signals and cognitive semantics, and it is difficult to accurately reflect the user's true purpose and perceptual state. <strong>(3) Sustainable system interaction</strong>: Most of the existing brain-computer systems are mainly based on one-way information transmission, which lacks feedback regulation and long-term adaptation mechanism for brain state, which is difficult to meet the needs of human-computer interaction in complex environments. In order to solve the above problems, the introduction of artificial consciousness model and new brain signal acquisition technology as a breakthrough will provide a new idea and technical path for brain signal cognitive decoding.</p>\n<p>This project proposes a \"DIKWP×DIKWP\" mesh interaction model as the core theoretical framework, aiming to integrate the theory of artificial consciousness into the process of brain signal decoding and interaction. <strong>DIKWP is a five-level artificial consciousness model first proposed by Professor Yucong Duan's team, which includes five levels of \"data-information-knowledge-wisdom-purpose\". Compared with the traditional DIKW (pyramid) model, DIKWP adds \"Purpose/Purpose\" at the top layer, and realizes two-way feedback and iterative update of the semantics of each layer through a mesh structure. This innovative cognitive system is an academic milestone, enabling AI to embed human purposes, and providing a new way to solve the \"black box\" problem of intelligent systems and improve the interpretability of decision-making. In particular, the team further constructed the \"dual circulation\" DIKWP ×DIKWP architecture, introducing two closed loops: basic cognitive process and metacognitive cycle, to achieve self-monitoring, self-reflection and self-regulation. This \"dual circulation\" artificial consciousness architecture is seen as an important way to move towards autonomous self-aware AI. For brain signal decoding, the full-link semantic representation and purpose driving mechanism provided by the DIKWP model has unique theoretical value: it lays a foundation for the construction of a common semantic space between brain signals and cognitive semantics, so that brain signal decoding no longer stops at pattern classification, but rises to the</strong> <strong>semantic mapping of self-purpose and perceptual state. The</strong> step-by-step semantic parsing from raw neural data to high-level purpose is supported by a clear hierarchy under the DIKWP framework, which is expected to make the brain signal decoding process more transparent, interpretable, and closer to the user's subjective purpose.</p>\n<p>The introduction of the artificial consciousness model will also establish innovative semantic mapping capabilities between brain signals and self-purpose and perceptual states. Traditional brain signal analysis mainly focuses on mapping signals such as EEG to objective stimuli or motor thoughts, while artificial consciousness emphasizes the representation of subjective <strong>purpose and state of consciousness. For example, with the DIKWP model, specific EEG patterns can be correlated to the user's level of concentration, emotional state, or operational purpose at the moment,</strong> so that the system understands \"<strong>what the user wants to do</strong>\" rather than just \"<strong>what signals the brain is emitting</strong>\". This semantic mapping innovation capability means that the <strong>decoding of brain signals → semantic purposes and the encoding of semantic → brain signals can be incorporated into a unified framework to achieve a new paradigm of two-way communication between brain and machine. It is worth expecting that, with the support of the artificial consciousness model, the brain-computer interface system is expected to have a certain \"adaptive understanding\" ability, which can dynamically adjust the interpretation of the user's brain signals and avoid immutable hard mapping. For example, when a user is detected to be fatigued, the system can change the interaction strategy (such as reducing the difficulty of the task or enhancing the stimulus wake-up) through the feedback path, forming a more intelligent human-machine closed loop.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The breakthrough of brain signal recording technology is of great significance to the national strategy and future industry: first, in the field of cognitive computing, high-precision brain signal decoding is regarded as an important way to reveal the working principle of the human brain and promote strong artificial intelligence. By collecting and analyzing a large number of neural signals, we can deeply understand the neural mechanisms of high-level cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and decision-making, and feed back the construction and optimization of brain-like computing models. Secondly, in terms of human-computer interaction, brain-computer interface provides a new interaction paradigm for human beings, enabling the human brain to directly participate in the process of information exchange and control. For example, the use of brain signals to directly control exoskeletons or robots can help paralyzed patients regain their ability to exercise; Manipulating computers and virtual environments through brainwaves can bring a new experience of \"mind control\" to ordinary users. The emergence of brain-computer interfaces is subverting the traditional human-computer interaction model, and is regarded as the next generation of general interactive interfaces after keyboards and touch screens, which is expected to give birth to huge emerging industries. Thirdly, in the field of neurological rehabilitation, brain signal recording technology has shown cutting-edge value in adjuvant diagnosis and treatment. For example, by continuously recording the brain activity of epilepsy patients, early warning and closed-loop intervention of seizures can be realized. EEG monitoring and electrical stimulation of comatose patients can help assess residual consciousness and promote arousal; The use of BCI technology for motor imaging training in stroke patients can promote the remodeling of damaged neural circuits and improve the rehabilitation effect. These application scenarios all confirm the strategic significance of high-performance brain signal recording and decoding systems</strong>: it not only serves people's health and well-being, but also serves as a new engine to promote the intelligent society and digital economy.</p>\n<p>To sum up, this project will comply with the requirements of the national key special guidelines of \"Brain Science and Brain-like Research\", focus on the bottleneck of brain signal recording technology, integrate the advantages of DIKWP network interaction model and artificial consciousness theory, and open up a new route for cognitive decoding and interaction of multimodal brain signals. Through the implementation of this project, it is expected to enrich the cognitive computing basis of brain information decoding theoretically, break through the key devices and algorithms of new brain-computer interfaces in technology, and lead the development of intelligent medical care and human-computer interaction industry in application, which has important scientific significance and social and economic value.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Research-Objectives\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-Objectives\" title=\"Research Objectives:\"></a><strong>Research Objectives:</strong></h1><p>The overall goal of this project is to develop a new generation of multimodal brain signal recording and cognitive interaction system, and to achieve a technological breakthrough in the whole process from efficient brain signal acquisition, semantic decoding to real-time human-computer interaction. Specifically, it will focus on the following five aspects:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Research and development of high-throughput, low-power, and high-security brain signal acquisition systems: develop brain signal acquisition devices and chips covering non-invasive, deep and interventional application scenarios. The system should greatly improve the number and quality of signal channels under non-invasive conditions, and explore the safe acquisition of deep brain signals and the integration of minimally invasive interventional electrodes. It is expected to establish a highly biocompatible and miniaturized acquisition system to achieve high-channel-count parallel recording and long-term stable monitoring of neural signals</strong>. System power consumption and heat generation need to be tightly controlled to ensure safety when implanted or worn.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Brain signal semantic structure modeling and cognitive decoding pathway based on DIKWP model: Construct a brain signal decoding algorithm framework with DIKWP artificial consciousness model as the core, and open up the mapping pathway from neural data to cognitive semantics. By introducing the</strong> five-level semantic structure of \"data-information-knowledge-wisdom-purpose\", the brain signal features are represented and abstracted at multiple levels, and the high-level semantic markers reflecting the user's purpose or cognitive state are finally extracted. Develop a decoding model that can support multimodal, dynamic, and hierarchical cognitive state tracking, and form a verifiable mathematical model and algorithm in theory to achieve accurate semantic interpretation of complex brain signals. This goal will lay a new foundation for brain signal decoding to leap from pattern recognition to cognitive understanding.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>R&amp;D of adaptive adhesive non-invasive EEG acquisition system: For non-invasive applications, a new type of attached EEG electrodes and sensing components have been developed to</strong> significantly improve the acquisition quality and spatial resolution of EEG signals on the scalp surface. Specifically, high-density electrode arrays made of flexible electronic materials can be developed to fit the scalp surface, reduce contact impedance and improve signal stability; Explore dry electrodes, <strong>microneedle electrodes and other technologies that do not require conductive adhesives, so as to obtain cleaner signals while ensuring user comfort; Design adaptive mechanical structures or smart fitting mechanisms to adapt to different head shapes and head movements to reduce motion artifacts. Through wireless transmission and low-power front-end circuit design, this non-invasive EEG system is portable and easy to use. The expected result is to build a set of wearable and integrated EEG acquisition equipment, which can significantly improve the effective signal-to-noise ratio of traditional scalp EEG and increase the spatial sampling density by several times without reducing the convenience of use.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Construction of real-time interaction system of brain cognitive state based on artificial consciousness: The artificial consciousness model is used to realize the real-time perception of the user's brain cognitive state and the human-computer interaction response. Develop a closed-loop interactive system integrating software and hardware: the front-end acquisition module perceives the user's brain activity, and extracts the current purpose</strong> or state indicators such as attention and consciousness clarity through the DIKWP cognitive decoding engine; According to the analysis results of the artificial consciousness system, the back-end execution module gives appropriate feedback or control instructions (such as operating external devices, triggering sensory stimuli, adjusting the interface, etc.) in a timely manner, forming a \"brain-computer-environment\" continuous cycle interaction mode. In particular, the \"<strong>knowledge-purpose-feedback\" path in the DIKWP model is</strong> introduced, and a logical link from the environmental knowledge base to user purpose recognition and feedback decision-making is established in the system, so that the interactive system has certain adaptive and self-regulating capabilities. For example, for brain-computer training tasks, the system can automatically adjust the training rhythm or give hints (feedback) according to the user's brain fatigue level (knowledge) and the purpose of the target task, so as to maintain the best interaction effect. This goal will validate a new paradigm of human-computer interaction driven by artificial consciousness and create a more intelligent brain-computer closed-loop system.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Portable multi-modal brain signal acquisition equipment and digital analysis platform realization: Integrate the above technical achievements to develop a set of multi-modal brain signal acquisition and analysis platform</strong>to meet the dual application needs of medical and brain-like computing. In terms of hardware, it realizes portable integrated devices, modularly supports the synchronous acquisition of multiple brain signal modalities (such as EEG, fNIRS, ECoG, etc.), and has the necessary signal processing and storage capabilities. In terms of software, an open digital analysis platform has been developed, with a built-in cognitive decoding engine with DIKWP structure and a multi-modal data fusion tool, which can process the collected data in real time, visualization and intelligent analysis. The platform should be able to be flexibly configured according to different application scenarios: in medical assistance scenarios, it can be connected to the hospital information system to realize patient brain status monitoring and diagnosis and treatment support; In brain-like computing scenarios, it can interface with AI algorithms and brain simulation systems to support the integration of human brain data and artificial intelligence. Through standardized interfaces and secondary development support, promote the demonstration and promotion of the achievements of the platform. On the basis of ensuring safety and reliability, the final delivered system will achieve high channel count, high spatiotemporal resolution, multi-modal compatible brain signal acquisition, as well as intelligent interpretation and interaction at the semantic level, leading China's brain-computer interface system to a new generation of intelligent and practical stage.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"Research-content-and-technical-route\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-content-and-technical-route\" title=\"Research content and technical route\"></a><strong>Research content and technical route</strong></h1><p>Focusing on the above goals, the research content of this project is divided into five directions, and each direction supports and integrates each other to form a complete technical route:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Development of new brain signal acquisition materials, structures and devices: This direction focuses on tackling the hardware foundation of high-throughput and long-term stable brain signal acquisition. The study includes:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Flexible adhesive electrode array: Flexible electronic materials (such as graphene, biocompatible conductive polymers, etc.) are used to develop a malleable electrode array to ensure that the electrodes are tightly attached to the surface of brain tissue (scalp or cortex). Through the innovative electrode structure design (such as grid-like electrodes and comb-shaped electrodes), the electrode coverage density is improved to achieve high spatial sampling rate signal recording.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Optical Interfaces and Mixed-Modal Sensing: Exploring the Application of Optical Methods to Brain Signal Acquisition. On the one hand, a non-invasive near-infrared optical sensing module was developed to realize the measurement of cerebral hemodynamic signal (fNIRS), which is complementary to the electrical signal. On the other hand, optically coupled electrodes or fiber optic probes are studied that combine light sensing</strong>/stimulation with electrode recording for the detection of deep brain activity. For example, a photohybrid electrode with an integrated microlight source and a photodetector can be designed to sense local neuronal activity under minimally invasive conditions. High-speed optical data links will also be studied to replace some wired transmissions and improve the data bandwidth and anti-electromagnetic interference capabilities of implanted devices.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Microneedle Electrodes and Micro-Invasive Sensors: Microneedle array electrodes with millimeter scale or smaller are developed to achieve micro-invasive brain signal recording. Microneedle electrodes can be used to lightly puncture the epidermis or dura mater to obtain high-quality subcortical nerve signals with minimal trauma. Research includes novel microfabrication techniques for high-density microneedle arrays, electrode material coating optimization (to reduce impedance and inflammation), and adjustable pose insertion mechanisms for microneedles. For specific applications (e.g., epilepsy monitoring, deep brain signal acquisition), design implantable miniature sensor nodes</strong>, such as field-effect transistor (FET) amplifiers or MEMS sensors at the tip of the needle, to achieve in-situ high signal-to-noise ratio signal capture.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>**Ultra-high channel number acquisition circuit and system integration: Develop supporting front-end signal conditioning circuits and digital system structures to meet the concurrent acquisition requirements of hundreds to thousands of channels. The research focuses on ultra-low noise and ultra-low power consumption of multi-channel biological signal amplifier arrays and analog-to-digital conversion (**ADC) chips, and strives to reach the input noise level of &lt;5 μV and μW power consumption per channel. Hybrid synchronous sampling and multiplexing technology are used to realize the synchronous acquisition and high-speed transmission of thousand-channel signals. At the same time, it solves engineering problems such as the compatibility of wireless transmission and MRI for large-scale acquisition: the packaging and shielding design of high-bandwidth wireless communication modules (target more than 10 Mbps) and anti-magnetic field interference are studied. Finally, in terms of system integration, the wireless brain-computer interface chip with more than 128 channels and the prototype of the wired acquisition system with more than 1000 channels are realized, providing high-quality data sources for subsequent brain signal decoding.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DIKWP-driven brain signal encoding-decoding path modeling: this direction focuses on the conversion mechanism and theoretical model of brain signals to cognitive semantics. The study includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Multi-layer feature representation of brain signals: According to the DIKWP architecture, the processing of brain signals is divided into five levels: data, information, knowledge, wisdom, and purpose. The underlying data layer extracts the time-frequency characteristics of the original signal (such as power spectrum and coherence). The information layer further captures patterns and structures (e.g., the synchronization patterns of networks in specific brain regions); The knowledge layer combines prior cognitive knowledge to identify the cognitive process or stimulus category corresponding to the signal. The Wisdom layer synthesizes multi-source information to infer higher-level psychological states or decisions; The Purpose layer is ultimately mapped to the user's Purpose and</strong> Purpose representations. For example, for the EEG signals of imaginary movement, the data layer extracts μ rhythmic inhibition features, the information layer identifies the connections of movement-related brain regions, the knowledge layer judges that this is the Purpose category of \"left hand raised\", the Wisdom layer evaluates that the user wants to complete a certain action, and the Purpose layer confirms the user's purpose (such as picking up an object).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Semantic decoding algorithm for brain signals: Based on the above representations, a machine learning and inference algorithm that can automatically complete the mapping from signals to semantic labels is developed. Taking into account the nonlinearity and dynamics of brain signals, a combination of deep learning and symbolic inference will be employed: for example, a multimodal neural network will be built to extract EEG</strong>, NIRS and other data features, and at the same time, the relationship between brain function anatomy and task semantics is stored by the knowledge graph, and the two are connected through the DIKWP model interface. In the process of decoding, the algorithm not only outputs simple classification results, but also gives corresponding semantic interpretation paths (such as inferring which cognitive state according to which physiological model) to improve the interpretability and reliability of the results. In particular, the real-time dynamic decoding technology will be studied to cope with the time-varying characteristics of brain signals: sliding time windows and sequential models (such as LSTM, Transformer, etc.) will be used to continuously track the change of Purpose to realize the dynamic update and prediction of the user's cognitive state.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Multimodal and intermodal coupling modeling: A joint decoding model of modal relationships is established for multi-source brain signals (such as EEG+fNIRS, EEG+EMG, etc.) acquired at the same time. Statistical analysis and deep fusion network are used to reveal the intrinsic connection relationship and coupling mechanism between different signals</strong>. For example, to study the correlation patterns between scalp electrical signals and blood oxygen signals when cognitive load changes, or the mapping between cortical local field potentials and surface EEG. Such modal fusion is expected to overcome the uncertainty of a single signal and improve the accuracy and robustness of decoding. Finally, a unified decoding engine is constructed, which can output standardized cognitive semantic markup regardless of the input or combination of modal data. This lays the foundation for the algorithm of multimodal brain-computer interface applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Verifiable theoretical model: While the algorithm is developed, the general theoretical framework of cognitive decoding of brain signals is refined. Based on the hierarchical idea of DIKWP, an interpretable mathematical model is proposed, such as using information theory to quantify the information transfer efficiency between layers, and using the graph model to describe</strong> the reasoning path of knowledge and purpose. Small-scale controllable experiments are used to verify the hypothesis of the model, such as designing a cognitive task paradigm to induce specific brain signal changes, and testing the prediction accuracy of the model for signal-cognitive correspondence. This theoretical model will provide principle guidance for semantic decoding of brain signals and provide a basis for improving system performance.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Construction of the whole process interface of brain signal perception-cognition-execution: This direction is oriented to the integration of the brain-computer-environment closed-loop system, realizes the whole process architecture design of brain signals from acquisition, analysis to driving external response, and emphasizes</strong> the integration of the \"knowledge-purpose-feedback\" mechanism in the artificial consciousness system. The study includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Perception module</strong>: Integrate the hardware achievements of Direction 1 to build a multi-modal brain signal perception unit. Realize the synchronous acquisition and preprocessing of multi-channel EEG, NIRS and other data, design efficient artifact elimination and feature enhancement algorithms, and extract key neural signal patterns in real time. The perception module needs to have an event detection function, which can output a trigger signal when a significant brain state change or specific pattern (such as motor imagination onset, attention loss, etc.) is captured, and provide timing markers for subsequent processing.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Cognitive Decision-making Module</strong>: Artificial Consciousness ACPU <strong>(Artificial Consciousness Processing Unit),</strong> which has a built-in DIKWP cognitive decoding engine and knowledge-purpose inference model developed by Direction 2. The module receives the feature data input of the perception module, and internally performs inference operations according to the DIKWP semantic hierarchy to obtain the user's cognitive state evaluation (such as concentration/distraction, wakefulness/tiredness, etc.) and <strong>purpose discrimination</strong> (such as moving the cursor to the left/right and expressing \"yes/no\") at the current moment. The cognitive module has metacognitive monitoring capabilities, which can evaluate the credibility of the decoding result and self-correct - for example, when the decoding result is uncertain, the perception module can be requested to obtain more data or suspend execution, so as to improve the security of system decision-making.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Action &amp; Feedback:</strong> Responsible for translating cognitive decisions into external actions or feedback stimuli for two-way interaction. On the one hand, the <strong>execution submodule</strong> generates control commands for external devices according to the user's purpose, such as manipulating the robot arm, moving the cursor, selecting text, etc.; On the other hand, the <strong>feedback submodule imposes appropriate stimuli or cues to the user, including visual, based on the user's current brain state and task needs</strong>/Auditory cues, verbal conversations, or direct modulation of brain states (e.g., transcranial electrical/magnetic/ultrasound stimulation) via brain stimulation interfaces. In particular, in medical rehabilitation applications, the feedback module can be connected to an electromyography device or a rehabilitation robot to perform functional electrical stimulation or assisted movement on the patient. Through the knowledge base and rules (derived from the knowledge layer of the artificial consciousness model), the feedback method will intelligently adapt to the user's needs, for example, when the user's attention is detected, the system will give enhanced stimuli to improve arousal.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Closed-loop control strategy and security mechanism: The overall closed-loop control algorithm is designed</strong> to coordinate the working timing and information flow of the three modules of perception, cognition and execution, so that the system can form a real-time response cycle. Focus on solving the stability and delay problems of closed-loop control, optimize the delay of signal processing and decision-making, and control the total delay of perceived action feedback within an acceptable range (such as hundreds of milliseconds) to ensure the immediacy of interaction. In addition, a rigorous security monitoring mechanism is built to prevent adverse consequences caused by wrong decoding, including double verification of the user's purpose (the system and the user perform a simple confirmation interaction if necessary), setting the threshold conditions for the system to trigger the action, and immediately stopping the stimulation or controlling the action when the user's physiological state is abnormal, so as to ensure the safety and controllability of the closed-loop system in various situations.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Prototype system integration and verification: Integrate the above modules in a laboratory environment to build a prototype of a closed-loop brain-computer interface system. Typical application scenarios were selected for validation experiments, such as: <em>Scenario A: Exercise rehabilitation of stroke patients</em>: let the patient try to control the exoskeleton through mind, the system decodes its motor purpose in real time and drives the exoskeleton, and at the same time monitors the patient's consciousness and promotes behavior through sensory stimulus feedback; <em>Scenario B: Ideation and Typing</em> Communication - Let the person with movement disorder choose the character to spell the word through imagination, the system will determine its purpose in real time and output it on the screen, and the voice assistant will give prompts and encouragement whenever the user's concentration decreases. Through multiple rounds of experiments, the performance indicators of the closed-loop system in terms of accuracy, response speed, user experience, etc., are evaluated, and the control strategies and parameters are continuously improved to form a stable whole-process interactive system.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Co-design of multimodal EEG/brain imaging/optical coupling system: This direction aims to co-design a variety of brain functional imaging and signal recording methods, give full play to the advantages of multimodal fusion, and improve the depth and accuracy of monitoring brain cognitive state. The study includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>EEG-fNIRS dual-modal system</strong>: An integrated EEG+fNIRS synchronous acquisition device is designed to simultaneously monitor neuroelectrical activity and hemodynamics. In terms of hardware, the layout of EEG electrodes and near-infrared light sources/detectors is optimized to reduce mutual electromagnetic and optical interference. Synchronous trigger and time calibration module was developed to ensure that the time alignment error of the two signals is in the millisecond range. Algorithmically, the fusion decoding method of EEG and fNIRS signals was studied, the spatial positioning information provided by blood oxygen changes was used to corroborate the source of EEG brain regions, and the high temporal resolution of EEG was used to analyze the immediate effect of fNIRS changes, so as to achieve higher accuracy than single modality cognitive state discrimination. In particular, for children and adolescents, a bimodal system is used to study the characteristics of brain development, and to extract dynamic neural connection patterns and biomarkers at the development stage.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>EEG-Imaging-Photostimulation Coupling</strong>: Explore the possibility of combining EEG with novel brain imaging techniques (e.g., functional ultrasound imaging fUS, optogenetic imaging) and photostimulation methods. In animal models, EEG was attempted to synchronize recording with high-resolution functional ultrasound imaging to obtain a fine map of neural activity in the deep brain. A matching signal processing algorithm was developed to integrate the activity information of deep brain regions provided by fUS into EEG decoding, breaking through the limitation that traditional EEG cannot effectively perceive deep signals. In invasive or semi-invasive conditions, introduce optogenetics**/photostimulation interfaces**, such as stimulation of specific neuronal populations with optogenetic probes, while recording feedback on the effects of EEG on the whole brain to establish stimulus-response models. This series of studies will broaden the connotation of multimodal systems to cover <strong>multiple dimensions such as electrical-blood oxygen-ultrasound-light stimulation, and provide richer perception and intervention methods for the design of brain-computer interface systems.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Signal Collaborative Acquisition and Calibration Algorithm</strong>: Solve the problem of multi-modal signal coordination at the physical level and data level. Including: the development of a unified multi-modal data acquisition hardware motherboard, which can interface with different types of sensor modules and provide a unified power supply and clock reference; Develop cross-modal artifact suppression and feature alignment algorithms, such as eliminating the common interference of heartbeat and respiration on EEG and NIRS, and using template matching or independent component analysis to separate the unique components of each modality; Establish a calibration standard for multimodal datasets, which is convenient for mapping data collected by different subjects and different devices to the same frame of reference for comparative analysis. Through co-design and algorithm fusion, the multi-modal system can work stably, reliably, and efficiently, and its output data can be seamlessly fed to the DIKWP decoding engine.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Multimodal synergy validation</strong>: Experiments are designed to verify the utility of multimodal fusion in complex cognitive tasks. For example, driving simulation experiments were carried out to record the driver's EEG, eye movement, heart rate, etc., to evaluate the accuracy of multi-source signal fusion on the driver's distraction detection. Or in a brain-computer collaborative game, EEG and EMG can be obtained at the same time to verify whether fusion decoding can more accurately identify the player's purpose. Through these verifications, the design of the multimodal cooperative system is optimized and provides a basis for subsequent applications.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Development of a cognitive-brain-computer interface platform based on DIKWP structure: This direction integrates all the above R&amp;D results to build a cognitive brain-computer interface platform for practical applications</strong>.

In terms of software, the core BCI operating system or middleware is developed, and various device drivers, data communication interfaces and algorithm libraries are encapsulated to provide unified task management and resource scheduling. The operating system will be embedded with the DIKWP cognitive architecture, which will enable the platform to have semantic processing capabilities supported by artificial awareness models. Through the collaborative design of software and hardware, the real-time, security and fault tolerance of the system as a whole are ensured.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Medical scenario adaptation and verification: Customize the development and testing of the platform for medical assistive devices and neurological rehabilitation applications. For example, the development of subsystems for motor function rehabilitation, including motor imagination training applications, exoskeleton interfaces, rehabilitation assessment tools, etc., to achieve training assistance for stroke or spinal cord injury patients; To develop a communication assistance subsystem for patients with impaired consciousness, including a simple word selection and spelling interface based on EEG and a visual evoked potential</strong> (VEP) awareness detection tool, etc., to help patients with \"locked-in syndrome\" realize their basic wishes.

Based on feedback from medical experts and patients, the ergonomic design of the hardware and the human-machine interface friendliness of the software are continuously improved to lay a good foundation for future medical device registration.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Adaptation and verification of brain-inspired computing scenarios: Expand the application of the platform for the field of brain science research and brain-inspired intelligence. For example, the platform is used in brain-computer hybrid intelligence experiments: healthy subjects are allowed to wear devices to participate in complex tasks (such as combining the human brain and AI for image recognition) to study the fusion mechanism of human brain signals and AI decision-making; Or connect the platform to a neuromorphic chip</strong> to obtain the human brain response during chip computing in real time, which can be used to debug and improve the brain-inspired computing model. Develop platform interfaces that support the use of brain science researchers, such as providing flexible programming tools and data recording and analysis modules, so that researchers can use this platform to carry out various brain cognitive experiments.

Prepare the technical documentation and test reports required for product registration, and strive to ensure that the core modules of the platform pass the test of medical device certification standards (such as biocompatibility, electromagnetic compatibility, software security level, etc.).

All key technical indicators must meet or partially exceed the requirements of the national key R&amp;D program guidelines to ensure the high-quality realization of the overall project objectives.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Application-demonstration-and-promotion-path\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Application-demonstration-and-promotion-path\" title=\"Application demonstration and promotion path\"></a><strong>Application demonstration and promotion path</strong></h1><p>The results of this project have a wide range of application prospects and promotion value, and it is planned to benefit the society through carefully planned demonstration applications and industrial transformation paths.</p>\n<p>1. Demonstration of application in the medical field: The results of the project will first be demonstrated in the diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases and neurological rehabilitation. It is planned to cooperate with large tertiary hospitals and rehabilitation centers to select the following typical application scenarios for verification:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases</em>: For brain dysfunction diseases such as epilepsy, depression, autism, etc., the multimodal brain signal acquisition and analysis platform developed by this project is used to carry out auxiliary diagnosis and efficacy monitoring. For example, high-density EEG acquisition and DIKWP decoding algorithms are applied in epilepsy patients to realize automatic detection, prediction and early warning of seizures. In patients with depression, EEG and near-infrared signals are used to monitor their mood-related brain activity, which provides an objective basis for evaluating the effect of drug treatment. These demonstrations will verify the value of the system in clinical monitoring and decision support, and improve the accuracy of disease diagnosis and treatment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Neurological rehabilitation and assistive devices</em>: In the rehabilitation of stroke hemiplegic patients, a brain-controlled exoskeleton training system is deployed, and patients wear brain-computer interface equipment developed by the project to drive the exoskeleton to complete the corresponding actions by imagining limb movements, so as to carry out rehabilitation training. The system evaluates the patient's motor purpose and concentration in real time, gives appropriate sensory feedback, enhances brain plasticity and promotes recovery. At the same time, brain-computer interface wheelchairs were tried in patients with spinal cord injury, so that high paraplegics could control the movement of wheelchairs with their minds and improve their self-care ability. The demonstration application of these assistive devices will provide a new means of rehabilitation for people with disabilities and greatly improve their quality of life.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to promote the implementation of medical demonstration, the project team will assist the partner hospitals to carry out the necessary ethical review and clinical trial filing. User and clinical feedback was collected during the demonstration process to further optimize the system's human-machine interface and algorithm performance, and improve the user guide and training materials. Through the successful demonstration in the medical industry, the medical credibility of productization is established, and authoritative case support is provided for subsequent promotion.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Demonstration of brain-like intelligence and human-computer interaction: The results of the project will also be promoted in a wider range of human-computer intelligent interaction fields.

Users can wear brain-computer interface devices to perform operations such as using their brains to control smart speakers to play music, and adjusting the brightness of indoor lighting with their attention levels. This kind of scene display allows the public to intuitively feel the convenience and magic of brain-computer interaction, and promotes its application in the field of Wisdom life.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Immersive Entertainment &amp; Education</em>: Partnering with game development companies to develop VR games or training applications based on brain signals. For example, in a brain-controlled VR game, the player drives the action of the game character through meditation or concentration, and the DIKWP decoding engine judges the player's emotions and purpose in real time to adjust the difficulty of the game to improve the immersion and interactive experience. Another example is the development of attention training software, which uses brain feedback to guide teenagers to enhance their concentration. These applications will validate the attractiveness of the project's technology in the entertainment and education markets and nurture demand.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Industrial &amp; Special Industries</em>: Explore the application of brain-computer interfaces in specific industries, such as the use of brain signals for rapid input to improve operational efficiency in the field of communications, and the use of brain-computer interfaces to improve control accuracy and speed of operation by pilots/operators in the aerospace or military fields. This kind of high-end demonstration can help to win the interest and investment of relevant departments and enterprises, and realize the forward-looking layout of technology in key areas.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3. Promotion and industrial transformation path: In order to achieve the long-term sustainable development of the project results, we have formulated a clear promotion and commercialization roadmap:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Patents and standards</em>: Apply for domestic and foreign patents for the core technologies developed by the project in a timely manner, and consolidate independent intellectual property rights. At present, Professor Duan's team has built a complete patent pool related to DIKWP, and the new achievements of this project will also be included in the scope of patent protection. At the same time, it actively participates in the formulation of domestic brain-computer interface technical standards and ethical norms, and incorporates the methods and indicators accumulated by the project into industry standards to enhance the right to speak and influence.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Productization and company incubation</em>: In the later stage of the project, select achievements with high technical maturity and clear market demand to carry out productization work. It is planned to set up a special high-tech start-up company or cooperate with existing industrial partners to promote the engineering and production of brain-computer interface acquisition equipment, <strong>cognitive decoding software suites</strong>, <strong>brain-controlled rehabilitation systems and other products. Leverage the team's industry connections in the field of artificial intelligence to seek venture capital and industry funding support to accelerate product launch. It is expected that the results of the project will have industrialization potential in the markets of medical rehabilitation equipment, smart wearables, education and entertainment software, etc., and can form a new economic growth point.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Training and ecological construction</em>: Through the implementation of this project, a group of interdisciplinary talents who master the cross-technology of brain-computer interface and artificial intelligence will be cultivated, including postdoctoral fellows, doctoral students and young engineers.

Background and significance of the study\"></a><strong>1. Background and significance of the study</strong></h1><h2 id=\"1-1-Background-requirements-for-brain-inspired-multimodal-tactile-perception\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#1-1-Background-requirements-for-brain-inspired-multimodal-tactile-perception\" title=\"1.1 Background requirements for brain-inspired multimodal tactile perception\"></a><strong>1.1 Background requirements for brain-inspired multimodal tactile perception</strong></h2><p>With the development of artificial intelligence and robotics, giving machines human-like tactile perception has become the key for agents to achieve dexterous operation. Compared with perception systems that rely only on vision, the sense of touch, as an important \"language\" for agents to interact with the environment, can provide rich information such as mechanics, temperature, and texture of objects, which helps robots complete more refined and safer operations. For example, when human fingers assemble tiny parts or operate tools, they are constantly corrected by closed-loop haptic feedback to achieve micron-level control that far exceeds the accuracy of visual positioning. In robotics applications, the introduction of high-resolution multimodal tactile sensing is expected to enable robots to have human-like ability to correct small errors, and complete delicate tasks that in the past only skilled craftsmen could do.</p>\n<p>However, the effective integration and application of multi-modal haptics (such as force sense, temperature, slip sense, material texture, etc.) faces many challenges: first, the data dimension of multiple sensing signals is high and the update frequency is fast, and the traditional serial acquisition and centralized processing architecture often leads to high latency and high energy consumption, which is difficult to support closed-loop control in time. Secondly, the information units of different modes are different (such as the magnitude of force, temperature change, vibration spectrum, etc.), and how to effectively compress and extract features without losing key details poses a challenge to the existing information processing. Traditional force control methods usually rely on low-dimensional simplified models, which are difficult to cover such a rich range of tactile information. Therefore, a new brain-like information processing paradigm is urgently needed to efficiently integrate multimodal tactile information and improve the system's ability to interact with the environment through closed-loop feedback.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of biological inspiration, the <strong>human somatosensory system itself has a highly parallel and distributed multimodal perception mechanism. For example, the human hand can simultaneously sense the pressure, temperature, and texture of an object, and integrate these sensory signals in the nervous system in real time for judgment and decision-making. Multimodal fusion has significantly improved the ability to evaluate and recognize the attributes of objects. On the other hand, if the traditional linear scheme of acquisition before calculation is used in the manual system, not only the processing link is lengthy, but also the bandwidth and power consumption are huge because each sensing signal needs to be digitally transmitted and</strong> processed 。 This has pushed researchers to explore more brain-like hardware and algorithms, such as neuromorphic chips, which can complete the fusion and compression of different modal signals at the front end of the sensing, thereby reducing the processing burden on the back end. It has been proved that by integrating new devices such as memristors into pressure sensors, multi-modal signals such as pressure and temperature can be fused in situ into a unified pulse sequence, which not only significantly improves the data compression rate and response speed, but also ensures the independent decoding and high fidelity of different modal information in the fusion signal. These advances provide important ideas for the development of efficient multimodal haptic sensing hardware.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-2-DIKWP-mesh-model-modeling-advantages-of-cognitive-perceptual-execution-closed-loop\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#1-2-DIKWP-mesh-model-modeling-advantages-of-cognitive-perceptual-execution-closed-loop\" title=\"1.2 DIKWP mesh model: modeling advantages of cognitive-perceptual-execution closed-loop\"></a><strong>1.2 DIKWP mesh model: modeling advantages of cognitive-perceptual-execution closed-loop</strong></h2><p>In order to give full play to the role of multimodal haptics in intelligent closed-loop control, it is necessary to have corresponding cognitive models to effectively characterize and regulate the whole process from perception to decision-making to executive feedback. In this regard, the DIKWP model proposed by the team of Professor Yucong Duan of Hainan University in China provides a new solution. DIKWP is a new cognitive framework based on the classic \"Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom\" cognitive hierarchy model with a \"Purpose/Purpose\" layer. More importantly, the DIKWP model breaks the limitations of the traditional DIKW pyramid of one-way progression, and transforms the five cognitive elements from a linear hierarchical structure to a highly networked network structure. This network DIKWP model allows multi-directional coupling feedback between various levels, especially the purpose at the highest level, which can influence the perception and decision-making process downward, so as to more realistically describe the cognitive mechanism of the complex dynamics of the human brain. The results show that after the DIKWP model introduces the purpose dimension and adopts the network interaction structure, up to 25 pairwise interaction paths can be formed between the five elements, including bottom-up perceptual transmission (such as data→ information, information → knowledge), top-down purpose regulation (such as purpose→ Wisdom, Wisdom → knowledge), and same/cross-layer parallel two-way interaction (such as information ↔ knowledge, Wisdom ↔). Purpose, etc.). This means that the cognitive system is able to interact dynamically at different levels, just like the brain, such as high-level <strong>purpose to guide attention allocation</strong>, memory and emotion to influence the interpretation of new information, etc.</p>\n<p>The introduction of the DIKWP mesh model in the brain-like multimodal tactile system has significant modeling advantages. First, it <strong>provides a clear semantic structure support for the formation of a closed loop of perception-cognition-execution-feedback: the original tactile data obtained by the underlying sensor (D) is processed and upgraded into environmental information (I),</strong> which is further integrated to form knowledge of the environment and the contact object <strong>(K),</strong> thereby supporting the system to make wisdom-based decisions or action plans <strong>(W).</strong> , and ultimately the <strong>Purpose (P) layer of the system directs and adjusts the entire process. Through such hierarchical abstraction, the sensing, cognition, and decision-making modules in the robot's tactile system have a unified semantic interface, so that information can circulate between different levels without losing meaning. Second, the</strong> network structure of DIKWP allows the cognitive layer to inversely guide the perception layer: for example, when the destination layer sets a specific operation purpose, the upper layer will impose \"expectations\" on the lower level of perception, so as to achieve predictive perception and attention modulation similar to the human brain. This helps to extract the most relevant features for the task at hand in the flood of tactile data, enabling cognitive-driven information compression and improving processing efficiency and robustness. Thirdly, the formal semantic mathematical framework provided by the DIKWP model enables each cognitive link and its transformation rules to be represented by mathematical structures. This provides a well-defined basis for modeling the information flow of complex tactile systems, facilitates the analysis of the behavior of the system at all layers, and ensures the consistency and explainability of the coordination of each module in the execution of the closed loop.</p>\n<p>Based on the above advantages, the DIKWP mesh model has been regarded as a major theoretical innovation in the field of artificial intelligence cognitive computing. The model establishes a unified \"cognitive language\" within the AI system, so that every step of the AI from perception input to decision output can be traced. In particular, by explicitly incorporating \"Purpose\" into the model, DIKWP is able to combine subjective goals with objective cognitive processes, providing a new paradigm for the construction of autonomous agents. In this project, the DIKWP model is introduced to guide the interactive modeling of multimodal tactile information, which can give full play to its advantages of structured semantic representation and multi-directional feedback on the cognitive-perceptual-execution closed loop, and lay a theoretical foundation for the construction of a tactile cognitive system similar to the human brain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-3-Artificial-Consciousness-Theory-Empowering-Self-Perception-Interaction-Purpose-Generation-and-Feedback-Regulation\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#1-3-Artificial-Consciousness-Theory-Empowering-Self-Perception-Interaction-Purpose-Generation-and-Feedback-Regulation\" title=\"1.3 Artificial Consciousness Theory: Empowering Self-Perception, Interaction Purpose Generation and Feedback Regulation\"></a><strong>1.3 Artificial Consciousness Theory: Empowering Self-Perception, Interaction Purpose Generation and Feedback Regulation</strong></h2><p>With the development of artificial intelligence, artificial consciousness (AC) has gradually become the frontier exploration direction to improve the advanced cognitive ability of autonomous agents. This project integrates the theory of artificial consciousness into the brain-like tactile system, aiming to endow robots with initial \"self-awareness\", so as to show a higher level of perceptual understanding and autonomous decision-making ability in self-environment interaction.</p>\n<p>The role of artificial consciousness in this study is first reflected in the enhancement of the system's <strong>self-environment perception ability. It is difficult for a typical control system to distinguish between changes from the external environment and the impact of its own actions, but after the introduction of the artificial awareness module, the system will establish an internal \"self-model\", which can monitor the difference between its own state and the external environment in real time. For example, when a mechanical finger is holding an object, the Artificial Awareness module helps the system realize that \"applying pressure\"</strong> is its own behavior and that the \"reaction force of the object\" comes from the outside, thus interpreting the sensor signal more accurately. This self-awareness helps to improve the accuracy of the interpretation of tactile information and reduce interference caused by one's own movements.</p>\n<p>Secondly, artificial consciousness can generate interactive purposes based on internal and external perceptions, and actively guide system behavior, rather than just passively responding to the environment. The tactile system with artificial consciousness will simulate the human purpose generation mechanism: when it detects that the environmental state does not match the target, the artificial consciousness module will trigger the corresponding <strong>purpose signal</strong>, drive the system to take action to close the gap. For example, when the robot finger senses that the sliding trend of an object exceeds the safety threshold, it can autonomously generate a \"firm grip\" and adjust the control strategy accordingly to increase the gripping moment. This process of generating a purpose is similar to the instinctive \"grasping\" of a human being when he perceives that a cup is about to fall, which embodies initiative and foresight. Driven by the purpose of artificial consciousness, the haptic system is able to make more flexible decisions based on the current context, rather than relying on pre-programmed fixed feedback logic.</p>\n<p>Third, artificial consciousness provides a high-level feedback regulation mechanism for the system, allowing it to self-monitor, self-reflect, and self-regulate. This can be achieved through the introduction of the \"Dual Circulation\" architecture (DIKWP ×DIKWP). The so-called dual cycle is to add a metacognitive cycle in addition to the basic cognitive processing process. The basic loop processes the perceptual information from the environment and generates the action output; The metacognitive cycle, on the other hand, continuously monitors the working status and results of the basic cycle and compares them with the desired goal. When deviations occur, metacognitive loops (i.e., artificial consciousness modules) generate reflective signals that regulate the parameters and behaviors of the basic cycles. This architecture is equivalent to giving the system a \"mental eye\"<strong>: looking at the environment as well as itself. In this project, we plan to adopt the artificial consciousness system architecture of DIKWP × DIKWP, and use one set of DIKWP cognitive processes for environmental information processing and the other set of DIKWP processes for metacognitive self-monitoring, and the two are nested with each other to form a complete consciousness system. This design has been regarded as an important way to build an AI system with initial self-awareness in relevant research and patents. Through this feedback and control of artificial consciousness, the robot's haptic system can autonomously find problems and correct them during task execution: for example, when it detects that the grasping action does not achieve the expected effect, it autonomously adjusts the strategy; Or evaluate the results and accumulate experience after completing the task to improve the performance of the next execution. This self-regulation capability will significantly improve the safety and robustness of the system's operation</strong>, avoiding the accumulation of errors and loss of control.</p>\n<p>Finally, from a higher perspective, incorporating artificial consciousness can also help achieve human-machine collaboration and value alignment. With the introduction of the \"purpose\" layer of the DIKWP model, the decision-making process of the AI system becomes more transparent and controllable, and each step can be explained and traced. \"By embedding the key layer of 'purpose' inside the model, we are not only able to make AI smarter, but also ensure that it always serves human values and security needs,\" said Professor Yucong Duan. This means that tactile systems with artificial consciousness can better understand human purposes when interacting with people, and can behave in line with human expectations and ethical norms, avoiding risky behavior. This is of great strategic significance for the deployment of autonomous robots in a hybrid human-machine environment in the future.</p>\n<p>In summary, the introduction of artificial consciousness theory into the brain-inspired multimodal tactile system can <strong>improve the intelligence level of robots at multiple levels of perception and understanding, active decision-making and self-regulation, and promote their evolution to a higher form of autonomous agents. This project will take the DIKWP ×DIKWP model as the core framework, give full play to the role of artificial consciousness in</strong> self-environment perception, purpose generation and feedback control, and establish a human-like self-awareness and cognitive closed loop for tactile robots.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-4-Benchmarking-strategic-value-with-international-frontiers\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#1-4-Benchmarking-strategic-value-with-international-frontiers\" title=\"1.4 Benchmarking strategic value with international frontiers\"></a><strong>1.4 Benchmarking strategic value with international frontiers</strong></h2><p>This study is closely related to the major national demand in the field of brain-inspired perception and intelligence, and has important strategic significance and frontier value. First of all, at the national level, the development of independent and controllable intelligent perception chips and brain-like cognitive systems is the basis for ensuring the safety of China's new generation of artificial intelligence and high-end manufacturing. Under the current international situation, the risk of core AI chips and key algorithms being controlled by others has attracted much attention. This project aims to develop multi-modal tactile perception chips and integrate independent innovation cognitive models and artificial consciousness architectures, which will help fill the gap in the field of intelligent sensors and cognitive processing chips in China and enhance technological autonomy. At the same time, smart robots and embodied intelligence are also one of the key technologies to support the upgrading of high-end manufacturing, aerospace, medical rehabilitation and other industries. Robots with human-like tactile and cognitive abilities can be widely used in precision assembly, hazardous environment operations (such as disaster relief, explosive disposal), medical care, and prosthetics for the disabled, meeting the country's urgent needs in intelligent manufacturing, national defense security, and healthy China. It can be seen that this project has important strategic value for consolidating China's technological advantages in the field of intelligent robots and seizing the commanding heights of the future industry.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of international frontiers, the research content of this project is also closely aligned with the latest trends in academia and industry. In terms of multimodal tactile sensing, there have been some international exploration results. For example, as early as the 2010s, the American company SynTouch launched the BioTac bionic tactile sensor, which is the world's first multi-modal haptic device that can simultaneously sense three-dimensional force, temperature and micro-vibration, and can simulate the all-round haptic function of human fingertips. Products such as BioTac have played an important role in the study of robotic haptics, verifying the value of multimodal haptics in object recognition, <strong>material discrimination, and force control feedback. In recent years, research teams from various countries have also successively reported the results of multi-functional integrated flexible electronic skin, single-chip multi-modal tactile sensing modules, etc. For example, the Tsinghua University team has developed an ultra-thin and flexible tactile sensor array that integrates sensory functions such as pressure, temperature, slip, and texture, providing service robots with tactile capabilities close to human skin. Another example is the</strong> biomimetic electronic skin developed by Stanford University and other institutions, which uses organic flexible materials to achieve multimodal sensing of temperature and stress. It can be seen that multimodal tactile perception technology has become a research hotspot in the field of robotics, and various new materials, new devices and new architectures are constantly emerging.</p>\n<p>However, it should be pointed out that <strong>most of the current international research focuses on the new sensors themselves, and relatively little attention is paid to the cognitive processing and high-level intelligence utilization after sensing</strong>. Although many systems have the tactile perception hardware of humanoids, they are still limited to the traditional algorithm framework in terms of information utilization, and fail to give full play to the value of tactile information. While drawing on the achievements of international advanced sensors, this project will focus on breaking through <strong>the key bottleneck of perception-cognition fusion, and propose a new system with DIKWP cognitive model and artificial consciousness as the core. This kind of research idea of integrating advanced sensing hardware and advanced cognitive algorithms is still a cutting-edge exploration in the world, and has obvious innovation leadership.</strong></p>\n<p>In addition, in terms of artificial consciousness and cognitive explainability, this project also benchmarks against the highest international level. At present, more and more attention has been paid to the research on \"explainable, controllable, and safe\" in the global AI field, and how to make AI have a certain degree of self-awareness and understand its own decision-making logic has become a focus topic. Although companies such as OpenAI and DeepMind have made breakthroughs in large models, they have been less involved in artificial awareness and cognitive transparency. In contrast, Chinese scholars have taken the lead in the DIKWP artificial consciousness model, and the relevant patent portfolio of Professor Yucong Duan's team has formed a systematic technical barrier, which is unique in the innovation of AI cognitive structure. This project will make full use of China's theoretical advantages in this field to introduce artificial consciousness into the actual tactile robot system, and realize the first attempt to use artificial consciousness in multi-modal tactile closed-loop control in the world. This can not only enhance China's discourse power in the research direction of artificial consciousness, but also provide a \"Chinese solution\" for global AI ethics and governance.</p>\n<p>In short, this project integrates brain-like cognitive models, artificial consciousness architectures and multi-modal tactile chips, corresponding to major national needs and aiming at the international frontier of science and technology. The results will <strong>have a profound impact on the construction of embodied intelligence and brain-like perception system, and provide strong support for China to achieve a leading position in the era of general artificial intelligence.</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"2-Research-objectives-and-overall-technical-route\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-Research-objectives-and-overall-technical-route\" title=\"2.

Research objectives and overall technical route</strong></h1><h2 id=\"2-1-Research-Objectives\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-1-Research-Objectives\" title=\"2.1 Research Objectives\"></a><strong>2.1 Research Objectives</strong></h2><p>The overall goal of this project is to develop a brain-inspired multi-modal tactile chip and perception control system, and to break through the key technologies of multimodal tactile information cognitive processing and autonomous interaction. Specifically, it includes the following four aspects:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Development of a multi-modal tactile sensing chip system integrating DIKWP model</strong>: Design and develop a chip-level sensing system that can simultaneously sense multiple tactile information such as pressure, temperature, sliding friction, and material properties. The system needs to have brain-like information preprocessing capabilities, realize basic data fusion and compression at the sensor level, and provide high-quality input for subsequent cognitive processing.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Realize cognitive-driven information compression, modal fusion and feedback control path</strong>: Based on the DIKWP cognitive model, a complete information processing link from sensor data to decision output is established. Through the guidance of high-level cognition (knowledge, wisdom, and purpose) to low-level perception, the selective compression and deep integration of multi-modal tactile data are realized, and a closed-loop control path is formed, and the decision-making results are fed back in real time to adjust the sensing and execution.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Design a tactile purpose generation and intelligent interaction platform with the artificial consciousness system as the core</strong>: build a software and hardware platform embedded in the artificial consciousness module, so that the system has the ability of self-monitoring and <strong>purpose management. The platform can independently generate or adjust the haptic interaction purpose according to environmental changes and task requirements</strong> , and coordinate functional modules at all levels to complete complex human-machine/human-computer interaction tasks.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Complete the sensory-cognitive closed-loop demonstration in typical application scenarios</strong>: verify and demonstrate the application of the developed tactile perception control system in at least three representative practical scenarios. For example, <strong>the industrial precision assembly scenario verifies the robot's ability to use the sense of touch to achieve high-precision assembly; The service robot scenario verifies the role of multimodal haptics in flexible grasping and safe interaction between humans and the environment. The Smart Prosthetic/Rehabilitation scenario validates the effectiveness of the artificial haptic system in improving the fine control and haptic experience of the prosthetic user. Through the above demonstration, the performance indicators and application value of the evaluation system are summarized.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"2-2-Overall-technical-route\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-2-Overall-technical-route\" title=\"2.2 Overall technical route\"></a><strong>2.2 Overall technical route</strong></h2><p>In order to achieve the above goals, the project has planned a clear technical route, as shown in the figure below (omitted). The technical route is based on the brain-like cognitive architecture, which organically combines multimodal tactile sensing hardware, cognitive algorithms and artificial consciousness modules to form a complete closed-loop system.</p>\n<p><strong>(1) Dual-cycle brain-like architecture design:</strong> We first propose a \"dual-cycle\" brain-like information processing architecture, that is, DIKWP×DIKWP model-driven cognitive system architecture. In this architecture, there are two layers of nested cognitive loops: <strong>the basic loop, which is responsible for the processing and feedback control of environmental tactile information, and the metacognitive loop</strong>(Artificial awareness) is responsible for monitoring and regulating the basic cycle. Specifically, the basic loop runs according to the DIKWP model process: the data collected by the sensor (D) extracts information (I) through multi-level processing, forms knowledge (K) by combining the knowledge base and context, makes Wisdom judgment (W) in the decision-making unit, and finally forms the output of action instructions by the Purpose module (P). At the same time, the metacognitive cycle also follows the DIKWP structure, but it processes the data inside the basic loop, such as the system's own state, decision-making basis, error signal, etc., abstracts these internal information into higher-level semantics, and then generates meta-purpose by the artificial consciousness module to guide the adjustment of the basic loop. Through the dual-cycle architecture, the high-level purpose can not only directly face the environmental target (the P-layer of the basic cycle), but also act on the system itself through the meta-cycle (the meta-P-layer regulates the basic cycle), so as to realize the adaptive regulation of the internal and external environment. This architecture is considered by relevant research to be a new direction towards autonomous AI, providing an overarching blueprint for our haptic systems.</p>\n<p><strong>(2) Multi-modal tactile sensing and pre-processing:</strong> At the hardware front-end, the haptic chip developed in this project integrates various types of miniature sensor units to simulate the multi-modal receptors of human skin. These include: a highly sensitive array of pressure sensors for sensing normal force distributions, shear/acceleration sensors for detecting slip and vibration (corresponding to slip), high-resolution thermal sensors for measuring temperature changes and the thermal conductivity of objects (auxiliary material identification), and the necessary humidity/conductivity sensors for detecting material media (e.g. liquid presence or material discrimination). The selection and layout of each sensing unit will refer to the biological structure of human fingertips, and realize the acquisition of rich information such as contact surface deformation, texture, and temperature difference. In order to reduce the processing pressure on the back-end, the front-end of the chip will be fused with neuromorphic pre-processing circuits. For example, memristor arrays or pulse coding circuits can be integrated at the sensor output stage to convert analog signals into pulse trains or incremental information in situ for event-driven data compression. This hardware-layer pre-processing can greatly reduce the amount of redundant data, extract key tactile events, and provide efficient input for subsequent DIKWP layer processing.</p>\n<p><strong>(3) Cognitive hierarchy division and information flow:</strong> In the core information processing, the system organizes the algorithm modules in strict accordance with the DIKWP hierarchical structure, so that the information is → information → knowledge → <strong>Wisdom → Purpose</strong> Each layer is refined and fused step by step, and the upper and lower interactions are realized through mesh feedback. The specific process is as follows: the data layer (D) obtains the original or pre-processed haptic data stream from the sensor chip, such as the pulse burst of the sensor node; The information layer (I) denoises and extracts patterns from the data, and extracts meaningful feature descriptions, such as contact strength, temperature curve, vibration spectrum, surface texture features, etc.; The knowledge layer (K) integrates multi-source information, and combines prior knowledge for understanding and reasoning, so as to form an understanding of the current contact state (such as the type of object material, whether it is stable, the friction coefficient and other regular knowledge); According to the output of the knowledge layer, the Wisdom layer (W) comprehensively considers the current task objectives and the environmental context to generate specific decision-making schemes or control strategies (such as judging whether it is necessary to adjust the finger posture, apply more force, or change the contact point, etc.), which reflects the judgment of the strategy layer and the answer to \"what is the best\". Finally, the <strong>Purpose layer (P) evaluates and selects the solutions of the Wisdom layer according to the ultimate goal and value criteria of the task, determines the final execution of the action Purpose, and sends instructions to the executor. At the same time, the Purpose layer will also feed back the high-level goals and expectations to the lower layers, guiding the perception and knowledge acquisition process to align with the overall purpose. This information flow mechanism ensures that each level of the system has a clear basis for decision-making, and accepts the constraints of high-level goals, forming a closed-loop cognitive control chain</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>(4) Artificial consciousness module integration:</strong> In addition to the above basic cycle, we have designed an artificial consciousness module (metacognitive cycle), which runs through all stages of the information processing process. The artificial consciousness module includes sub-units such as self-state perception, <strong>meta-knowledge reasoning</strong>, and <strong>meta-purpose decision-making, which are used to continuously monitor the internal operation of the system and the compliance with the external environment. For example, it tracks the actual effect of the actuator's completed action, compares it with the desired target, and calculates the error; Monitor compute resource usage and uncertainty levels at each layer to assess the reliability of current knowledge. Once a deviation or anomaly is found, the artificial consciousness module will enter the meta-wisdom judgment process to analyze the cause (is it a perceptual error?). Insufficient knowledge base? Or is it a change in the environment? ), and then generate a tuning strategy at the meta-Purpose layer (such as increasing the sampling rate of a sensor, invoking an alternate knowledge model, or adding redundancy checks to the execution layer). These adjustments act on the underlying loop-related layers through the feedback interface of the meta-→ foundation, optimizing the system behavior in real time. For example, when artificial consciousness detects that haptic sensing may be saturated and distorted, it can order the data layer to enable different gain modes; In addition, when uncertainty in knowledge judgment is detected,</strong> the Wisdom layer can be prompted to adopt a more conservative strategy or try a few more times. The deep involvement of this artificial consciousness makes the system have human-like self-reflection and error correction capabilities, and truly realizes the stable control of the global closed-loop.</p>\n<p><strong>(5) Interaction between the actuator and the environment:</strong> Finally, the action Purpose generated by the above layers of processing is executed by the robot actuator (such as mechanical fingers, grippers, etc.) to complete the operation task in the real environment. During the execution process, the environmental state changes (e.g., object movement, force changes), and these changes are captured by the sensor and fed back to the data layer, starting the next cycle. In this way, a closed-loop control is formed: sensing-cognition-decision-execution-resensing, and the cycle repeats. At the same time, the artificial awareness module works continuously throughout the process, ensuring that each cycle moves towards the overall goal and constantly corrects deviations. Through this technical route, we will achieve seamless connection in the chip hardware layer, cognitive algorithm layer and consciousness decision-making layer, and build a brain-like tactile system with perceptual understanding, independent decision-making and self-regulation capabilities.</p>\n<p>All in all, the technical route of this project is guided by the DIKWP×DIKWP dual-cycle model, from the underlying sensor chip to the high-level artificial consciousness platform, layer by layer, layer by layer, layer by layer, and finally form a comprehensive solution integrating software and hardware. This route not only ensures the gradual progress of the research work, but also ensures that the interface between the modules is clear, collaborative and efficient, and provides a reliable path guarantee for achieving the project goals.</p>\n<h1 id=\"3-Core-research-content\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-Core-research-content\" title=\"3. Core research content\"></a><strong>3. Core research content</strong></h1><p>Focusing on the above technical routes and objectives, this project intends to carry out the core research work in the following four aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>1. Brain-inspired tactile perception modeling and chip design: Referring to the physiological mechanism of the human somatosensory system, brain-inspired modeling is carried out on the process of tactile perception, and multimodal tactile sensing chips are developed accordingly. The research contents include: analyzing the functional characteristics and distribution rules of various sensing units such as mechanoreceptors and thermoreceptors in human skin, and establishing a conduction and coding model of tactile signals in organisms; On this basis, a bionic sensor design scheme is proposed, such as using flexible polymer materials to simulate the skin surface, integrating micromechanical structures to achieve sensitive response to pressure, shear and vibration, and using MEMS thermopiles to detect temperature and heat flow. It focuses on the multi-modal integration and miniaturization packaging technology of sensors, and solves the compatibility process and crosstalk suppression problems of various sensing components on a unified chip. At the same time, the on-chip primary signal processing circuit is developed</strong>, including low-noise amplification, filtering, analog-to-digital hybrid conversion, etc., so that the chip output conforms to the data format required for subsequent cognitive processing. It is expected that through this task, the tape-out manufacturing and testing of the first version of the multi-modal tactile sensing chip can be completed, and the chip should be able to provide rich and reliable haptic raw data, and have certain brain-like preprocessing capabilities (such as real-time frequency analysis of vibration signals, etc.).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>2. DIKWP-driven tactile signal cognitive coding system: construct a hierarchical coding and understanding system for tactile signals based on the DIKWP model. This research focuses on solving the problem of information extraction and representation of \"sensory → perception → cognition\". It mainly includes: research and development of conversion algorithms from the data layer to the information layer, such as event-triggered pulse coding, which converts continuous sensing data into discrete event streams; Using signal processing and machine learning techniques, key features (sudden changes in force, temperature change rate, friction and vibration mode, etc.) are extracted from tactile time series to form a structured information representation. Then, the cognitive coding mechanism from the information layer to the knowledge layer was designed: the knowledge graph or causal graph was explored to represent tactile situational knowledge, and the multimodal information was mapped into semantic labels and relationships (such as \"object A -</strong> smooth surface and temperature 20°C - stable grip\"). This step requires the integration of prior knowledge (thermal conductivity of the material, typical coefficient of friction, etc.) with real-time information to make inferences about the current contact state. Next, the decision support approach from the knowledge layer to <strong>the wisdom layer is studied : using means such as inference engines or reinforcement learning, to give the best action suggestions based on the existing knowledge (e.g., judging whether the finger pressure direction needs to be adjusted to increase friction). The whole coding system will operate under the DIKWP framework, and the high-level</strong> Purpose can participate in the low-level coding process through a feedback mechanism, for example, using the idea of predictive coding, the Purpose layer will provide the prediction signal, and only encode the error information after comparing with the actual sensor data, so as to greatly reduce the amount of data. Through this task, it is expected to form a complete set of haptic cognitive coding algorithm libraries, so that the system can \"understand\" tactile information in a human-like way, and closely associate perception and cognition.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>3. Multimodal Fusion and Artificial Consciousness Feedback System: Develop tactile multimodal information fusion algorithm and artificial consciousness-driven feedback control system. This task focuses on the spatiotemporal fusion of cross-modal information and the decision-making and regulation of consciousness level</strong>. Firstly, the fusion strategies of multi-modal tactile information are studied, including: spatial fusion, which integrates the tactile information of different sensing areas/different fingers to form an overall environment model; Modal Fusion – Analyze pressure, slippery, temperature, and other characteristics to extract higher-level scenario descriptions (e.g., a comprehensive judgment of \"an object will fall\" based on pressure changes and slip rates). Deep neural networks (such as multimodal fusion Transformers) or neuronal pulse networks can be used to achieve cross-modal feature association and global pattern recognition. Then, the artificial consciousness feedback loop was constructed: on the basis of fusion perception, the artificial consciousness module was introduced to evaluate and regulate the operation of the system. Specifically, several core functions of artificial consciousness are studied: <strong>adaptive Purpose management</strong>, which dynamically adjusts the output of the Purpose layer according to the current task goal and environmental changes, such as generating a secondary Purpose (such as \"re-grabbing\") to overwrite the original Purpose when necessary; <strong>Anomaly detection and self-regulation</strong>: The algorithm is designed to monitor the inconsistency or abnormal pattern between perception and the knowledge layer, and once it is found (such as abnormal spikes in sensor data or knowledge reasoning conflicts), artificial consciousness triggers emergency feedback, and directly corrects the execution command or requests more detailed perception information through the fast channel, so as to avoid the expansion of errors; <strong>Meta-learning and memory</strong>: Let the artificial awareness module record each decision and result, and continuously update its own understanding of \"self-ability\" and \"environmental law\", so as to optimize and adjust the strategy in long-term operation. Through the research of this task, it is expected to realize a control system with multi-modal adaptive fusion and self-regulation capabilities: externally, it can flexibly respond to various complex tactile scenes and make correct responses; Internally, it is able to self-monitor and improve to ensure that the system operates with high reliability.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>4. Typical application demonstration design: In order to verify the effectiveness of the above technologies, this task will design three types of typical application demonstration scenarios for actual needs, and formulate detailed experimental plans and evaluation indicators. The proposed demonstration scenarios include, but are not limited to: (A) Industrial parts assembly scenarios</strong>: such as fine bearing assembly or electronic component insertion, the robot needs to use tactile perception to align small deviations to achieve high-precision assembly. We will introduce the assembly task of micron-level error into the experiment, and test the speed and final accuracy of the error convergence (the goal is to reach the level of a skilled human technician) under tactile closed-loop control. <strong>(B) Service robot grasping scenario</strong>: Let the robot grasp daily necessities (fragile or smooth items such as glasses and eggs) in the home environment to verify the multi-modal haptic sense for grip stability and adaptability to different materials. The evaluation indicators include: the types of items that the robot can successfully grasp with the assistance of haptics and the success rate, the breakage rate during the placement process, and the improvement in performance compared with pure visual control. <strong>(C) Bionic artificial hand/prosthetic scene</strong>: The developed tactile chip and cognitive system were integrated into the finger of the prosthetic limb to test the ability and experience feedback of amputee patients using the prosthesis to perform fine movements (such as picking up a paper cup and pouring water, tying shoes, etc.). The effect of artificial haptic feedback on improving motion accuracy and user perception was emphatically evaluated. In this task, we will design comparative experiments in each scenario, collect quantitative data, comprehensively verify the effectiveness and robustness of the system, and further optimize the system design to meet the practical application needs based on the demonstration results.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above four parts of the research content are interrelated and gradually deepened: from basic hardware to algorithm model to application verification, forming a complete research system. The results of each part will provide support for the next part, for example, the output of the chip will be fed into the cognitive coding system, and the coding and fusion algorithms will be tested and improved in the application demonstration. Through this series of closely connected research work, this project is expected to make a comprehensive breakthrough in the key technology of \"brain-like multimodal tactile perception system\" and achieve innovative results with international advanced level.</p>\n<h1 id=\"4-The-hardware-system-and-software-and-hardware-collaborative-design\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-The-hardware-system-and-software-and-hardware-collaborative-design\" title=\"4. The hardware system and software and hardware collaborative design\"></a><strong>4. The hardware system and software and hardware collaborative design</strong></h1><p>This project attaches great importance to the collaborative optimization of hardware system design and software algorithm development, and strives to integrate software and hardware to realize brain-like tactile perception and cognitive functions. In the research, we will make full use of the project team's accumulation in haptic AI chips, cognitive models and artificial consciousness architecture to build a technical solution combining software and hardware.</p>\n<p>First of all, in terms of hardware platform, we will develop a dedicated haptic perception SoC chip that integrates a multi-modal sensor array and a primary signal processing unit. This chip not only provides high-quality tactile data acquisition, but also undertakes part of the data preprocessing and encoding functions, reducing the computing burden of the host computer. For example, the pulse coding circuit embedded in the chip can directly output the event stream, eliminating the overhead of traditional A/D sampling. On-chip integrated memory computing units, such as memristor arrays, enable simple pattern matching or threshold detection, with initial information screening done locally. The design of these hardware will directly consider the semantic partitioning requirements of the DIKWP model for data, so that the underlying output can be connected to the high-level algorithm more naturally and efficiently. The project team has a research foundation in AI chip design, and has successfully developed the first batch of tactile perception chips in China and participated in related key projects. We will learn from past experience and use a hybrid digital-analog circuit and a low-power architecture to ensure that the chip meets the real-time and energy consumption requirements. At the same time, through the modular design, the chip has good scalability, providing space for subsequent function upgrades or process iterations.</p>\n<p>Secondly, in terms of software systems, we will develop supporting cognitive and control software frameworks, including signal processing, middleware, cognitive reasoning engines, and artificial consciousness core modules. The software design will fully consider the hardware characteristics to realize the decoupling and asynchronous parallel of software and hardware: for example, we develop asynchronous event-driven processing algorithms for the pulse events output by the chip; In view of the possible noise and uncertainty on the chip, we add redundancy checksum and adaptive filtering algorithms to the software layer to improve the robustness of the system. In the cognitive inference engine implementation, we will leverage high-performance computing libraries and possibly AI-accelerated hardware (e.g., GPUs, NPUs) to run deep learning models or complex knowledge inference. At the same time, these calculations are encapsulated as services through middleware for the upper-level artificial consciousness module to call and coordinate. The artificial consciousness module itself acts as the \"brain\" of the software, coordinating the operation of all parts: we will realize the prototype of a cognitive operating system, encapsulating the five layers of functions of the DIKWP model into a process that can be monitored, and making the internal decision-making process of the system transparent. In this way, developers and debugging tools can monitor the status of data, information, knowledge, wisdom, and purpose within the AI just like monitoring the operating system, providing convenience for system optimization and security supervision.</p>\n<p>In the process of hardware and software co-design, we pay special attention to the coordination mechanism between circuit implementation, data fusion, chip control and cognitive feedback. For example, to support high-speed feedback from artificial consciousness, we will reserve an emergency interrupt path in the hardware, so that high-priority awareness commands can bypass the conventional control chain and act directly on the actuator, reducing latency. For another example, in order to achieve the deep integration of multimodality, we consider sinking part of the fusion computing to the hardware, such as using reconfigurable logic to implement simple multimodal correlation calculation on the chip, so as to reduce the pressure of bus data transmission. Another example is the introduction of configurable parameters (gain, threshold, etc.) at the circuit level, and the opening of interfaces for high-level software adjustment, so that artificial consciousness can \"tune\" the sensor and circuit status in real time as needed, and realize the self-adaptation of software and hardware linkage.</p>\n<p>The research accumulation of the project team in related fields will strongly support the above-mentioned software and hardware collaborative design. Professor Yucong Duan's team has been engaged in the research of cognitive computing and artificial intelligence for a long time, and took the lead in proposing the DIKWP model and won the Wu Wenjun Artificial Intelligence Award and other honors. In recent years, the team has published a large number of achievements in the direction of knowledge representation, semantic computing, and artificial consciousness evaluation around the DIKWP model, and applied for 114 related invention patents, building a complete DIKWP technology system. These patented technologies cover many fields from large model training, cognitive operating systems to AI governance, providing a rich reserve of algorithms and frameworks for this project. In terms of hardware, the project team members maintain close cooperation with the industry, have an in-depth understanding of the industry status of tactile sensors and smart chips, and have participated in national chip research and development projects, with practical experience from design to tape-out. The team includes researchers who are good at electronic engineering and circuit design, as well as software talents who are good at artificial intelligence and cognitive science, and has achieved interdisciplinary integration. This people's and knowledge will ensure that hardware and software are fully coordinated from the start of the design, avoiding silos and improving development efficiency and system performance.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the project will carry out system development under the guidance of the idea of software and hardware synergy. Through hardware empowerment software and software optimization hardware, a tightly coupled brain-like tactile perception system is created. This collaborative design will greatly improve the real-time, reliability, and intelligence of the system, and also lay the foundation for future engineering results.</p>\n<h1 id=\"5-Phased-achievements-and-assessment-indicators\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#5-Phased-achievements-and-assessment-indicators\" title=\"5. Phased achievements and assessment indicators\"></a><strong>5. Phased achievements and assessment indicators</strong></h1><p>The project is expected to produce the following outcomes in phases over the research cycle, measured by clear indicators:</p>\n<p>Phase 1 (beginning of the year to the end of the year): haptic chip development and basic performance verification. Achievements include: the first generation of multi-modal tactile perception chip samples, and supporting signal acquisition systems. Assessment indicators: the chip integrates no less than 4 kinds of tactile sensing units (pressure, temperature, slip, material, etc.), and the performance of each sensor meets the design requirements (such as the force range of the pressure sensor is 0~20N, the sensitivity is ≤ 0.1N, the temperature sensor is 0~100°C, the resolution is ≤0.1°C, etc.); The data output bandwidth of the chip meets the update rate of ≥1kHz full sensor array; The chip consumes less than 50 mW (typical mode of operation). Experiments show that each sensing channel of the chip functions normally, and can obtain multi-modal signals at the same time without interfering with each other, which preliminarily verifies the feasibility of multi-modal sensing.</p>\n<p>Phase 2: Cognitive coding algorithm and DIKWP model implementation. <strong>The results include: a DIKWP-based tactile cognitive coding software prototype, covering data→ information → knowledge→ Wisdom's processing module, and a basic Purpose decision-making module. Assessment indicators: The algorithm is tested on standard datasets and simulated environments to achieve effective compression and recognition of multi-modal tactile data. For example, in the haptic scene built in the laboratory, the system can compress the original sensing data by at least 90%</strong> without losing key event information. The recognition accuracy of common objects (such as metal, wood, plastic) is ≥ 95%; The detection delay of slide/grip state changes ≤ 10ms for timely feedback. Each layer of the DIKWP model is functionally complete, and the five-layer semantic mapping is realized, that is, manual inspection can confirm that a multi-level representation of the tactile scene has been formed inside the system. At this stage, the initial construction of the knowledge base and rule base (covering no less than 50 haptics-related knowledge rules) should also be completed.</p>\n<p>Phase 3: Multimodal Fusion and Artificial Consciousness Integration Platform. The achievements include: building a tactile perception and control platform integrating software and hardware, integrating multi-modal fusion algorithms and artificial awareness modules. Assessment indicators: The platform realizes the closed-loop control of real robot devices, and can run stably for at least 1 hour without interruption. The sub-functions of the artificial awareness module are validated to detect anomalies and successfully trigger adjustments. For example, if a sensor failure is artificially created during the test, the artificial consciousness should detect it and switch to degraded mode within 100ms; Faced with new objects that are beyond the scope of the knowledge base, artificial consciousness can instruct the system to take exploratory actions to obtain new information. In terms of fusion performance, the system has good recognition and control of comprehensive scenarios (such as objects of different weights and temperatures): for example, the accuracy rate of classifying objects with 8 different attributes is not less than 90%. In addition, the platform provides a user-friendly monitoring interface, which can display the five-layer status of DIKWP and the purpose decision-making process in real time, so as to realize the interpretable presentation of the internal processes of the system.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 4: Demonstration and evaluation of typical application scenarios. The results include: completing the system demonstration application of three typical scenarios before the end of the reporting period, and forming a detailed test report. Assessment indicators: The task success rate and performance indicators of each scenario meet the expected requirements. For example, in the industrial assembly scenario, the system successfully completes at least 95 of the 100 precision plugging tasks, and the average positioning accuracy reaches within 0.1mm, which is better than the 1mm level under pure visual control, and in the service robot scenario, the success rate of grasping and placing 10 kinds of daily items is ≥ 90%, and the fragile items are not damaged. Prosthetic application scenarios: Participants in the test can master the use of tactile prostheses to complete at least 3 daily delicate operations within one week of training, with a success rate of ≥ 80%, and the subjective feedback tactile realism reaches the level of \"close to real feel\". Through these scenario test data, it is proved that the system developed in this project has practicability and reliability in the actual environment</strong>. At the same time, for the problems exposed in each scenario, we will put forward improvement plans in the report to provide a basis for follow-up research or productization.</p>\n<p>Stage 5: Theoretical model and standard output of results. In addition to physical and experimental indicators, the project will also produce important theoretical and standardized results. Including: the mathematical definition and proof of the DIKWP cognitive feedback model, the design specification of the artificial consciousness interaction architecture, and the corresponding software interface specification. Assessment indicators: Publish no less than 5 high-level papers (including more than 3 papers included in EI/SCI) during the implementation of the project, apply for no less than 5 national invention patents, and take the lead in formulating or participating in the formulation of more than 1 standard/specification in related fields. These results will make the impact of the project not only limited to engineering realization, but also have guiding significance for academia and industry.</p>\n<p>In summary, this project ensures that the research work is carried out in an orderly manner as planned through clear phases and quantitative indicators, and outputs measurable and evaluable results. These phased results will jointly verify the degree of achievement of the project objectives and support the final acceptance.</p>\n<h1 id=\"6-Feasibility-analysis-and-transformation-plan\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#6-Feasibility-analysis-and-transformation-plan\" title=\"6.

Professor Duan's team took the lead in proposing the DIKWP artificial consciousness model, which enjoys a high reputation in the field of artificial intelligence cognitive computing at home and abroad. As early as 2020, the team's achievements based on the DIKWP theory won the Wu Wenjun Artificial Intelligence Science and Technology Award, reflecting the innovation and leadership of its research work. So far, the team has published a series of high-level papers around the DIKWP model, applied for hundreds of invention patents, and built a complete technical system covering cognitive models, evaluation methods, operating system frameworks and other aspects. These studies not only establish the unique advantages of this project in terms of theoretical methodology, but also show the team's ability to translate cutting-edge ideas into concrete technologies. In particular, it is worth mentioning that the team's patent portfolio has formed a systematic layout in the field of cognitive structure and artificial consciousness, and has strong competitiveness and negotiation power compared with international giants. This means that our research solutions are globally leading and original, avoiding duplication of competition with others and providing a favorable IP environment for the development of projects.</p>\n<p>The team also has a wealth of experience and resources in terms of hardware and engineering implementation. The backbone members of the project include engineers who are proficient in chip design and sensor technology, as well as software experts who are familiar with robot system integration and control, which truly realizes the talent allocation of software and hardware. The team has participated in a number of national scientific research tasks, and has successful cases in brain-inspired chips, circuit design, and embedded system development. For example, the haptic perception chip developed by the team members in cooperation with a company was approved and successfully developed in 2019, becoming the world's first digital-analog hybrid AI haptic chip, which provides valuable experience reference for this project. At the same time, we maintain cooperative relations with top universities and scientific research institutions in China (such as the tactile team of Tsinghua University, the brain-like chip team of Fudan University, etc.), and can share experimental conditions and test platforms. The existing laboratory has perfect equipment conditions such as micro-nano processing, chip testing, robot control, etc., which can fully support a series of workflows from chip tape-out, packaging and testing to system construction and commissioning. Therefore, the project team has sufficient strength to ensure the smooth progress of the research in terms of theoretical innovation and engineering implementation.</p>\n<p>Secondly, from the perspective of the feasibility of the technical route, each key link of the project is supported by the preliminary foundation, and has been verified and feasible to a certain extent. As the methodological core of the project, the DIKWP model has been used to explain brain cognitive processes in previous studies with success. This shows that the use of DIKWP for complex information processing is theoretically feasible, and we are only applying it to the field of haptics for the first time, which is groundbreaking but not out of nowhere. In terms of tactile chips, there have been similar multi-modal sensor development achievements at home and abroad, such as the aforementioned BioTac sensor and the tactile chip of Tashan Technology. These results show that multi-modal haptic sensing hardware can be fully realized, and this project will further improve the level of integration and intelligence on this basis. In addition, the work of Professor Liu Qi's team at Fudan University has proved the feasibility of multimodal neuromorphic perception: they have realized the fusion pulse output of temperature and pressure signals through a pressure sensor + memristor, which has been successfully used for multimodal object classification. It is worth noting that this work has also been supported by the National Key R&amp;D Program, which shows that the technical direction we aim at is in line with the layout of national scientific and technological development, and the research ideas are practical and recognized.</p>\n<p>Finally, <strong>we have also given full consideration to risk analysis and countermeasures. The challenges that may be encountered in the project include: the process complexity of multimodal integration of chips, the performance bottleneck of cognitive model software and hardware implementation, and the uncertainty of artificial decision-making. In this regard, we have formulated a plan: in the development of chips, we adopt a gradual iterative strategy, first do local functional verification, and then gradually expand the modal types, so as to avoid debugging difficulties caused by too many integrations at one time; In terms of software performance, by analyzing the computational amount of key algorithms, we make full use of parallel computing and hardware acceleration (trimming the model if necessary) to ensure that the real-time performance is up to standard. On the human consciousness module, a safety guardian mechanism is introduced</strong>, and the system is downgraded to the traditional control mode when the output of artificial consciousness is abnormal, so as to ensure safety and stability. Overall, these measures will minimize the technical and engineering risks of the project.</p>\n<p>In view of the above analysis, it can be assured that the implementation of this project is highly feasible. No matter from the perspective of team, foundation, technology, and risk control, we are ready to overcome the cutting-edge topic of \"brain-like multi-modal tactile chip and perception control system\".</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-2-Achievement-Transformation-Plan-Application-Prospects-and-Promotion-Strategies\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#6-2-Achievement-Transformation-Plan-Application-Prospects-and-Promotion-Strategies\" title=\"6.2 Achievement Transformation Plan: Application Prospects and Promotion Strategies\"></a><strong>6.2 Achievement Transformation Plan: Application Prospects and Promotion Strategies</strong></h2><p>The expected outcomes of this project are of great value at both academic and industrial levels, and we have developed a clear strategy for translation and promotion to ensure that the results are implemented.</p>\n<p>In terms of academic value, this project will fill the research gap in the field of artificial intelligence in the direction of the combination of multimodal tactile cognition and artificial consciousness, and it is expected that a series of theoretical and technical achievements (such as the application paradigm of DIKWP cognitive framework in robot hapticism, the implementation of artificial consciousness dual-cycle architecture, etc.) can be published in top international journals and conferences, so as to improve China's academic influence in this field. At the same time, we plan to actively participate in the development of standards and academic organizations in related fields. Relying on international platforms such as the World Artificial Awareness Conference (WCAC) hosted by the project team members, we will actively promote the DIKWP artificial awareness model and tactile intelligence technology, strive to incorporate our research results into part of the international AI standard framework, and enhance China's voice in global AI governance and standard formulation.</p>\n<p>In terms of industrial application, the market prospect of the results of this project is very broad. At present, a new generation of large models + embodied intelligence is emerging around the world, and major companies have an urgent need for technology to give robots similar to human perception and awareness. In particular, the advancement of humanoid robots represented by Tesla has made tactile sensors quickly become a hot spot in the industry. According to industry predictions, haptic intelligent components are expected to become one of the standard components of robots in the future, and its potential market scale is huge. Our multimodal tactile chips and cognitive systems have been developed in response to this trend and have a clear first-mover advantage. In order to accelerate the industrialization process, we plan to adopt the following strategies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Industry-university-research cooperation</strong>: In the implementation of the project, we will carry out cooperative research and development with powerful enterprises. At present, a well-known domestic robot company and chip company have been preliminarily contacted, and the other party has expressed strong interest.

Leverage the team's leadership in intellectual property and technology to win venture capital and create product solutions from chips to complete machines. For example, the introduction of intelligent haptic modules for industrial robot end effectors, or intelligent sensing kits for the prosthetic market. Once it takes the lead in the market, it is expected to bring considerable economic benefits. It is estimated that in the field of intelligent manufacturing and service robots, every little improvement in accuracy and reliability may bring billions of new markets, and our technology is expected to create new industry growth points.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Application demonstration and promotion</strong>: We will cooperate with user units to demonstrate and display applications in the later stage of the project, and publicize the project results through industry seminars, expos and other channels. For example, we invite a manufacturing leader to observe the haptic upcycling of our assembly robots, or work with a medical institution to demonstrate feedback from clinical trials of smart prosthetics. These success stories will greatly enhance the market recognition of our technology. With seed users and word-of-mouth, we will further expand our influence through media coverage, white paper releases, etc., to attract more potential customers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To sum up, the complete chain of \"research-development-application\" was considered at the beginning of the project, which not only pursues scientific breakthroughs but also meets the needs of the industry. Through the above careful transformation plan, we are confident that the project results can achieve real application and commercial value while serving the major strategic needs of the country, and contribute to the development of China's artificial intelligence and robotics industry.</p>\n<p>In summary, \"Research on Brain-like Multimodal Tactile Chip and Perception Control System Based on DIKWP Model and Artificial Consciousness\" has important theoretical significance and application prospects.

Stroke (stroke) is one of the second leading causes of death and disability worldwide, with tens of millions of new cases each year. In China, the survival rate of stroke patients continues to improve but the disability rate remains high, and millions of stroke survivors have long endured the difficulties and social burdens caused by hemiplegia, aphasia and other functional impairments. Traditional rehabilitation treatment is often time-consuming and has limited effect, and many patients are unable to fully regain their ability to take care of themselves in daily life, and new interventions are urgently needed to promote brain restructuring and functional reconstruction.</p>\n<p>At the same time, epilepsy affects about 50 million patients worldwide, of which about 30% are drug-refractory epilepsy, and frequent seizures bring great risks to patients' cognitive function, mental health and life safety. Existing medical therapy does not cover all patients, and surgical resection of the lesion is only available in a small number of cases. Therapies such as implantable vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and responsive nerve stimulation (RNS) that have emerged in recent years have brought new hope to intractable epilepsy. For example, closed-response neurostimulation devices (e.g., the Neuropace RNS) can automatically discharge to suppress seizures when abnormal brain electrical activity is detected, and long-term follow-up has shown that they reduce the frequency of seizures by about 60% on average. However, even with the above progress, seizures cannot be cured, and the mechanism of network damage and plasticity changes in the brain under the action of continuous epileptiform discharge has not been fully elucidated, and more in-depth mechanistic studies and more intelligent intervention programs are needed.</p>\n<p>Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), as a direct bridge between the brain and external devices, has shown great potential in the field of neurorehabilitation and brain disease intervention in recent years. It is able to decode the patient's brain signals into instructions to control external devices or feedback stimuli, enabling \"mind manipulation\" and functional compensation. For example, for patients with hemiplegia after stroke, a BCI-based rehabilitation system can identify the patient's residual motor purpose, drive a mechanical exoskeleton or functional electrical stimulation device for the paralyzed limb, and realize motor feedback training synchronized with brain activity. This brain-controlled motor feedback can enhance brain reorganization through the mechanism of \"use and use, and retreat\", and it has been shown that BCI combined with electrical stimulation training can significantly promote the recovery of motor function in patients with chronic stroke, and maintain the efficacy half a year after the end of treatment. Correspondingly, in the field of epilepsy, closed-loop brain-computer technology also shows the promise of inducing changes in brain plasticity and reducing seizures. It has been hypothesized that targeted electrical stimulation can be given in a non-seizure, low-risk brain state in a non-seizure state that can be used to \"reshape\" the epilepsy network in a healthy direction, rather than giving stimulation during a seizure. Recent reports support this hypothesis: a more significant reduction in seizure frequency occurs when the closed-loop device is stimulated more frequently during periods of relative calm, suggesting that time-specific neuromodulation may achieve long-term suppression of epilepsy through plasticity alterations.</p>\n<p>Although BCI has brought new ideas for stroke rehabilitation and epilepsy intervention, most current BCI systems still have the problem of insufficient intelligence. On the one hand, traditional BCI is mostly a one-way pathway, either decoding brain signals to drive external devices (for rehabilitation training) or detecting abnormal activities to trigger stimuli (for disease suppression), lacking deep two-way communication with the brain. On the other hand, the decision-making of the existing closed-loop system mainly relies on pre-set algorithms or simple rules, and lacks the understanding of the high-level semantic state of the brain and the patient's <strong>purpose goal. For example, conventional RNS devices for epilepsy only monitor EEG threshold-triggered stimuli and cannot adjust strategies based on the patient's state of consciousness at the time or long-term cognitive effects; Similarly, BCI for stroke rehabilitation rarely considers the influence of factors such as attention and motivation on the training effect. This \"shallow\" closed loop is difficult to adapt to individual differences and dynamic changes in brain state, which limits the improvement of efficacy.</strong></p>\n<p>At the same time, the field of artificial intelligence is undergoing a paradigm shift from data-driven to \"intelligent self-knowledge\". <strong>The artificial consciousness model provides a new opportunity for the realization of autonomous cognition and decision-making of machines. In this direction, the</strong> \"DIKWP\" network cognition model proposed by Prof. Yucong Duan's team has attracted extensive attention. The DIKWP model introduces the highest level of Purpose (Purpose) on top of the classic \"Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom\" cognitive level**, so that the agent has a clear goal orientation. The model realizes two-way feedback of semantics at all levels through mesh interaction, and gradually improves the perceived raw data to knowledge and wisdom, and the embedded Purpose unit continuously calibrates the decision according to the goal. This mechanism makes every step of AI's reasoning traceable, and the decision-making process becomes explainable and controllable for humans. It is foreseeable that the integration of artificial consciousness models such as DIKWP into closed-loop brain-computer interface systems is expected to give them \"adaptive wisdom\": the system is no longer only based on superficial signals to respond mechanically, but can understand the purpose of rehabilitation or treatment**to optimize the human-computer interaction strategy from the overall perspective. For example, in stroke rehabilitation, artificial consciousness can realize that the ultimate goal of training is to restore the patient's specific limb function, so as to dynamically adjust the stimulus and task difficulty; In epilepsy intervention, artificial consciousness can intelligently select the timing and intensity of stimulation with the purpose of reducing the seizure rate without impairing cognition. This kind of design that introduces high-level human cognition into the BCI closed-loop is expected to greatly improve the system's adaptability to complex physiological states and the driving effect of functional reconstruction.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, this project is based on the frontier interdisciplinary field of \"brain-computer interface-induced brain plasticity mechanism\", and proposes a new two-way closed-loop BCI framework integrating the DIKWP artificial consciousness model in response to the major needs of stroke rehabilitation and epilepsy intervention. By focusing on both basic mechanism research and engineering implementation, we plan to elucidate the scientific principles of brain remodeling with the participation of artificial intelligence, overcome the key technical bottlenecks of intelligent neuromodulation, and finally build a prototype system that can be used in stroke and epilepsy populations, opening up a new path for the rehabilitation treatment of major diseases.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Core-scientific-questions\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Core-scientific-questions\" title=\"Core scientific questions\"></a><strong>Core scientific questions</strong></h1><p>In this context, the project will focus on the following core scientific questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Mechanism of brain network plasticity:</strong> What neural circuit reorganization and brain network plasticity changes are involved in the recovery of brain perception and motor function and the improvement of brain disease symptoms under the long-term effect of brain-computer interface? For example, how can residual neural circuits be strengthened or reorganized through training during the reconstruction of the function of a paralyzed limb after a stroke? How does closed-loop stimulation induce the transition of abnormal discharge networks to a healthy model in epilepsy patients? These plastic changes cover the multi-level mechanisms from synaptic strength adjustment to functional network topological reorganization, which are still not well understood and need to be further studied and elucidated.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Coupling of consciousness and cognitive networks:</strong> In dysfunctional states such as dysfunction or seizures caused by stroke, how is the normal whole-brain network coupling and information integration process disrupted? When consciousness and cognitive function are impaired, how do the connection patterns of the various functional areas of the brain change? This project will explore the relationship between whole-brain network coupling mechanism and consciousness/cognitive state, and analyze which key networks (such as default network, attentional control network, etc.) are weakened or abnormally synchronized in the state of cognitive impairment. Based on this, we further explore how the introduction of the DIKWP artificial consciousness model can drive the reconstruction and functional improvement of the brain's cognitive network: can artificial consciousness, as an external agent, recoordinate the dysfunctional network connection through interaction with the brain, and promote the recovery of patients' cognitive ability and consciousness level?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>DIKWP Closed-Loop Cognitive Control:</strong> How should agents based on the DIKWP artificial consciousness model form a two-way closed-loop interaction with the patient's brain to achieve intelligent regulation of neural activity? Specifically, how can artificial consciousness obtain semantic information about the patient's state from multimodal brain signals and generate optimal intervention decisions through the five-layer reasoning loop of \"data-information-knowledge-wisdom-purpose\"? How does the closed-loop system have the ability to adapt to learning and continuously adjust strategies based on long-term efficacy feedback? Especially in the pathological process of dynamic changes such as epilepsy, how to ensure the real-time, stability and safety of artificial consciousness decision-making, and realize the timely and robust control of abnormal neural activity?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Multi-objective synergy and predictability:</strong> In practice, rehabilitation or treatment often involves multiple goals. For example, stroke rehabilitation needs to improve motor performance while taking into account cognitive and language functions. Epilepsy interventions are both to reduce seizures and avoid negative effects on cognitive functions such as memory. Can changes in brain function be predicted and quantified with the intervention of artificial consciousness? How can closed-loop intervention achieve multi-objective collaborative optimization and avoid \"taking care of one at the expense of the other\"? We will study and establish corresponding models and index systems to predict the functional evolution trajectory and potential side effects after artificial consciousness intervention, and guide the system to achieve the main goal without introducing new functional deficits. The mode of action and interaction mechanism in the process of multi-objective optimization are also important scientific issues, which need to be clarified through simulation and experiments.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Chip implementation and system integration:</strong> How to effectively implement the DIKWP artificial consciousness model into a clinically usable implantable**/non-implantable hardware system**？ At present, there is no mature device of \"artificial consciousness + brain-computer interface\" for reference, and this project needs to develop a prototype from scratch. What engineering and technical difficulties need to be overcome for this? For example, real-time neural signal processing, low-power and high-efficiency AI chip design, biomaterials and safety isolation, etc. How can the entire system architecture be designed to take into account the strict constraints of size and power consumption, while ensuring that wireless communication, biocompatibility, and safety protection meet clinical requirements? This question is related to the feasibility of transforming research results into practical applications, and we will explore them in depth in the project.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above scientific questions are interconnected and cover the entire chain from basic theory to technical realization. By addressing these key issues, this project will provide new perspectives for understanding and harnessing brain plasticity, and lay the theoretical and technical foundation for a new generation of intelligent brain-computer interface systems.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Research-Objectives\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-Objectives\" title=\"Research Objectives:\"></a><strong>Research Objectives:</strong></h1><p>The overall goal of this project is to <strong>elucidate the plasticity mechanism of brain function remodeling under brain-computer interface conditions, and to create a new closed-loop brain-computer system method integrating the DIKWP artificial consciousness model to improve the effectiveness of stroke rehabilitation and epilepsy intervention</strong>. With this overarching goal in mind, we have established the following specific goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Unraveling the neuroplasticity induced by brain-computer interfaces:</strong> Through animal models, imaging, and electrophysiology, we quantitatively study the recombination changes of brain neural circuits and functional networks under closed-loop brain-computer stimulation or training, and elucidate the key plasticity mechanisms that promote motor function recovery and inhibit seizures.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Construct a whole-brain network model in the state of consciousness disorder:</strong> establish a model that reflects the multi-region coupling characteristics of the whole brain in the state of brain dysfunction and seizures after stroke. To describe the dynamic characteristics of the network when consciousness and cognitive function are impaired, and to provide a targeted basis for artificial consciousness intervention.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Development of DIKWP-driven closed-loop control algorithm:</strong> Design and implement a closed-loop brain-computer intelligent control algorithm based on the DIKWP artificial consciousness model, including multi-level neural signal semantic decoding, purpose-driven decision-making engine and adaptive learning strategy, so that the system can generate safe and effective intervention instructions in real time and continuously optimize.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Build a two-way brain-computer interaction simulation platform:</strong> Establish DIKWP×DIKWP mesh interaction models to reproduce the two-way communication process between artificial consciousness and biological brain in the simulated environment, verify the effectiveness of multi-objective reasoning, semantic communication, adaptive feedback and other mechanisms, and provide design reference for actual systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Development of a closed-loop brain-computer interface prototype system:</strong> Integrate core modules such as artificial consciousness processing chips, cognitive feedback engines, and semantic perception decoding, and develop two-way closed-loop brain-computer interface prototypes that can be used for animal experiments and even preliminary clinical tests. The system needs to verify the functional effect and safety in stroke rehabilitation training and seizure intervention, and lay a foundation for subsequent clinical application.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Through the realization of the above goals, we hope to deepen the understanding of brain plasticity and intelligent intervention in science, create a new brain-computer interface paradigm led by artificial consciousness in technology, and promote the leapfrog progress of brain disease rehabilitation technology.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Research-content-and-key-innovations\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Research-content-and-key-innovations\" title=\"Research content and key innovations\"></a><strong>Research content and key innovations</strong></h1><p>Focusing on the research objectives, we have planned the following four major research contents, each of which condenses specific scientific/technical questions and innovations:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Research on the mechanism of neural circuitry and network plasticity under brain-computer interface This</strong><br/>section studies the plasticity changes that occur in the brain during the reconstruction of motor/sensory function and the improvement of seizures after stroke. The main contents include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Neural circuit reorganization in stroke rehabilitation: Stroke</strong> model animals or convalescent patients were recruited to observe the changes in brain functional connectivity before and after BCI feedback training by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and other techniques. It focuses on the remodeling of motor control-related networks (such as cortical-cortical connections and cortico-spinal pathways), and quantitatively evaluates the evolution of brain network topology from injury state to recombination enhancement. For example, resting-state fMRI was used to analyze changes in the strength of functional connectivity in brain regions to verify whether BCI training enhanced functional connectivity between impaired hemisphere motor regions. By comparing different training programs, the effects of sensory feedback and visual feedback on plasticity effects were discussed, and how the perceptual-motor <strong>closed loop could synergistically promote neural circuit reconstruction was revealed.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Network plasticity in epilepsy interventions:</strong> To investigate the mechanism of long-term closed-loop stimulation on the modification of abnormal discharge networks in patients with refractory epilepsy monitored by animal models of epilepsy (e.g., rodent ignition models) or implanted electrodes. The evolution of EEG network characteristics (such as synchronization rate and graph index) before and after the seizure was recorded by high-density electroencephalography (ECoG/EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), and whether closed-loop stimulation reduced the oversynchronization between the lesion and other regions of the whole brain, and whether it induced the formation of new inhibitory connections, thereby improving network stability. Combined with molecular biology assays, such as neurotransmitter receptor expression changes, to investigate the role of electrical stimulation-induced synaptic plasticity (LTP/LTD) in network remodeling. This part of the innovation lies in the introduction of brain network science into the evaluation of epilepsy stimulation therapy, most previous studies have only focused on changes in seizure frequency, and we will quantitatively describe for the first time how closed-loop interventions can change the network topology of the epileptic brain, providing a basis for understanding its long-lasting efficacy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Innovation:</em> Combining neuroimaging, EEG network analysis and BCI intervention, the system reveals the influence mechanism of closed-loop brain-computer interaction on neural circuit and network plasticity under two different pathologies: stroke and epilepsy. This can not only fill the gap in the current understanding of the mechanism of brain stimulation and plasticization, but also provide a biological target for optimizing intervention strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Unconscious-Cognitive Whole Brain Network Coupling and DIKWP Cognitive Improvement Mechanism in Dysfunction This</strong><br/>section focuses on the whole brain network coupling and cognitive mechanism in stroke and epilepsy patients in the state of functional impairment, and explores how artificial consciousness intervention can promote network reconstruction and cognitive improvement</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Network representation of consciousness/cognitive dysfunction: Brain</strong> network analysis is used to characterize the whole brain network characteristics of patients with severe stroke (who may have comorbid impaired consciousness such as coma/semi-comatose state) and epilepsy patients (especially when status epilepticus or frequent seizures lead to confusion). For example, the whole brain functional connectivity density, small world coefficient and other indicators are calculated to compare the differences between patients and healthy people. It is expected that the destruction of the modular structure of the brain network and the weakening of the function of key knots can be observed, reflecting the decrease in the coordination of various brain modules when consciousness and higher cognitive processes are impaired. Furthermore, combined with the frequency domain analysis of EEG/magnetic encephalography signals, typical signs such as slow wave enhancement and anterior-posterior regional desynchronization when the level of consciousness decreases were studied, and the network criterion of the degree of consciousness impairment was established.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>DIKWP Artificial Consciousness-Driven Network Reconstruction:</strong> Based on the above understanding of pathological networks, we will design simulations and experiments to verify the impact of DIKWP artificial consciousness model intervention on brain network coupling. For example, a compromised network (calibrated based on real patient data) is simulated in a computer model and the DIKWP agent interacts with it: the agent reads the network state and generates an intervention to promote network connectivity through its \"purpose\" module (e.g., simulating a node or asking the patient to perform a specific cognitive task) to see if the network metrics improve. This is similar to using artificial consciousness as an external \"brain\" to form a DIKWP ×DIKWP network dialogue with the patient's brain. We will focus on whether the overall efficiency and information integration can be improved under the effect of artificial awareness. In this process, if possible, we also plan to validate in the trials in which patients participate: having stroke/epilepsy patients receive BCI training with cognitive feedback (e.g., requiring concentration to complete BCI tasks, and artificial awareness modules give prompts or adjust the difficulty of the task according to their brain signals) to observe changes in the patient's brain network and the improvement of cognitive function. It is expected that artificial consciousness can restart or strengthen cognitive-related connections in the patient's brain, such as improving the synergy between the prefrontal lobe and other regions, leading to an increase in cognitive test scores.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Key Innovation:</em> Introducing Artificial Consciousness into the Intervention of Cognitive Impairment in Brain Diseases, which is a new research paradigm. We innovatively put forward the concept of \"whole-brain network coupling reconstruction\", emphasizing not only the treatment of local functions, but also the restoration of the overall information integration ability of the brain. The DIKWP model gives the system the ability to understand the patient's high-level purpose and cognitive state, which is different from the traditional passive way of simply stimulating neural circuits, and embodies the concept of closed-loop cognitive control, that is, to promote recovery by understanding and guiding the patient's conscious activities. This mechanism of human-computer collaborative gain is an original exploration of this project, which is expected to expand the application boundaries of brain-computer interface.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Simulation of Bidirectional Closed-loop Brain-Computer System Based on DIKWP×DIKWP Interaction ModelIn</strong><br/>this part, we will establish a mathematical model and simulation platform to verify the key processes of artificial consciousness and brain interaction, and provide guidance for system implementation. The details are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>DIKWP×DIKWP Mesh Interaction Architecture Design:</strong> Drawing on the \"dual circulation\" artificial consciousness system architecture proposed by Professor Yucong Duan, we build an interaction model that includes the main loop and the meta-loop: the main loop represents the real-time perception and decision-making process of the artificial consciousness to the brain, and the meta-loop represents the monitoring and adjustment of the artificial consciousness to its own decision-making. At the same time, one side of the brain is also abstracted into a DIKWP structure, that is, the brain can also be regarded as a multi-layered flow of \"data-information-knowledge-wisdom-purpose\" when processing information (where \"purpose\" corresponds to the intrinsic needs of the organism). Through this symmetrical interaction design, we can study how two DIKWP agents (artificial and biological) can coordinate through semantic level communication. In the model, the brain's \"data\" comes from neuronal firing, \"information/knowledge\" corresponds to patterns and memories, \"wisdom\" corresponds to integrated judgments, and \"purpose\" is its physiological or behavioral goals. The AI obtains brain data through sensing, and processes it through its own DIKWP layer to form an understanding of the brain state and countermeasures, and its \"purpose\" is the treatment target. We make the two continuously interact and iterate: the AI makes a stimulus or feedback based on the state of the brain, and the brain changes to generate new signals, and so on. The model will be implemented in the form of a mesh graph, with nodes representing different semantic hierarchical states and edges representing interactions, and we plan to use the model to analyze the stability and convergence conditions of the system, and determine under what circumstances the two sets of DIKWP cycles can achieve synergy and equilibrium.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Multi-objective reasoning and decision-making mechanism:</strong> Test the ability of artificial consciousness to deal with multiple objectives in a simulated environment. The setting scenario contains multiple goals (such as improving the patient's motor and language skills at the same time, or controlling two different types of seizures at the same time), and the artificial consciousness is inferred according to the DIKWP model: how to synthesize different goal requirements at the knowledge layer, weigh priorities at the wisdom layer, and finally form a decision that takes into account each goal at the purpose layer. This process can be formalized as a multi-objective optimization problem, but artificial consciousness should be able to approximate the solution through semantic reasoning. We will compare the differences between the artificial awareness strategy and traditional algorithms, such as weighted summation optimization, to see if it can handle goal conflicts more flexibly. In addition, the interpretability of decisions is examined: the DIKWP model unfolds the decision-making process hierarchically, and we will track the intermediate results of each layer to ensure that the contribution of each goal in the decision is clear, so as to achieve the interpretation of multi-objective decisions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Semantic Communication and Adaptive Feedback: Investigate</strong> how the exchange of information between the artificial consciousness and the brain goes beyond simple signaling and rises to \"semantic communication\". Specifically, we will design protocols that allow artificial consciousness, when interacting with the brain, not only to send fixed stimulus parameters, but also to send signals with semantic markers depending on the context. For example, in rehabilitation, artificial consciousness \"informs\" the brain about the meaning of current exercises through brain stimulation or sensory feedback (e.g., the purpose of emphasizing a muscle contraction), or conveys semantic cues such as \"calm\" during relaxation training in people with epilepsy. Our model will simulate how this semantic information is received and decoded by the brain and explore its impact on neuroplasticity. In addition, through the introduction of meta-loops, adaptive feedback control is realized, according to the changes in the brain's response to stimuli, the artificial consciousness adjusts the feedback content and frequency in real time to achieve the best effect. This is similar to an adaptive strategy in reinforcement learning, but is guided by a high-level Purpose in our framework. What's innovative is that we try to give closed-loop systems a certain level of \"language\" (albeit in the form of neural signals) to explore how machines can communicate with the brain in ways closer to the cognitive level, thereby inspiring more effective malleable change.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Innovation:</em> The core innovation of this part is to propose and validate the new concept of DIKWP ×DIKWP interaction model, and provide a unified description of brain-computer interaction through the dual-agent model. This model allows us to theoretically study complex behaviors such as stability, oscillation, and synergy in the artificial consciousness-brain closed loop. Compared with traditional black-box simulation, we have introduced semantic level considerations, and pioneered human-computer interaction to the level of \"understanding and dialogue\". In addition, the addition of multi-objective inference and adaptive feedback mechanism makes the system closer to the real application requirements and ensures that the simulation results are of guiding significance for the actual system design.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Prototype construction of bidirectional closed-loop brain-computer system and verification of neurointervention effectOn</strong><br/>the basis of the completion of the above basic and model research, this part focuses on engineering implementation and application verification, develops the actual closed-loop brain-computer interface system and evaluates its intervention effect on stroke and epilepsy</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Artificial Consciousness Chip and System Integration:</strong> A dedicated DIKWP Artificial Consciousness Processing Unit (ACPU) was developed to solidify the DIKWP model inference algorithm on high-efficiency hardware. The chip design adopts a combined ASIC/FPGA solution: the algorithm function and performance are verified on the FPGA platform, and then the ASIC is designed accordingly to reduce the size and power consumption. The internal architecture of the chip is optimized for the DIKWP model, which realizes parallel processing of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom layers, and adds a Purpose decision-making unit and a metacognitive monitoring unit to support the operation of the \"dual-cycle\" architecture. In terms of hardware implementation, model pruning, fixed-point operation and other means are adopted to ensure that the chip meets the power consumption and heat dissipation requirements of implantable devices. Then, the ACPU chip is integrated with a multi-channel neural interface to form an implanted bidirectional closed-loop device: including a high-density electrode array (to record brain signals and apply stimuli), a microprocessor module (responsible for communication with the chip and wireless data transmission), a secure power supply and packaging, etc. Biocompatible encapsulation materials and electrode coatings are specially designed to reduce tissue rejection and signal attenuation. The entire device needs to be miniaturized to a position suitable for implantation or wearing in the skull, and wireless connectivity for in vitro monitoring and parameter tuning. <strong>The system architecture diagram is shown in Figure 1, which shows the components and information flow of the brain-computer interface prototype</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"图片描述\" src=\"/cooperation/items/media/image7.png\" style=\"width:60%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;\"/><br/><em>Figure 1 Purpose of the bidirectional closed-loop brain-computer interface system architecture. The system consists of an implantable neural interface (sensing and stimulation), a DIKWP artificial awareness chip (decision engine), a cognitive feedback module and an external monitoring terminal. The brain nerve signals are collected by the sensor and semantically decoded and sent to the artificial consciousness chip for multi-layer inference, and the decision-making instructions generated by the chip drive the stimulator to apply electrical stimulation to specific areas of the brain (closed-loop main circulation) on the one hand, and on the other hand, the feedback module presents the patient in the form of visual/auditory to guide his cognitive state (closed-loop auxiliary circulation). There is a metacognitive monitoring unit inside the artificial consciousness chip, which carries out safety verification and adaptive adjustment of the main cycle decision-making to ensure that the system runs stably and controllably.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Stroke rehabilitation application verification:</strong> Qualified stroke hemiplegic patients are selected in the rehabilitation hospital environment, and preclinical experiments are carried out using the developed closed-loop BCI prototype. The brain signal is decoded by the artificial consciousness chip in real time to decode the high-order semantic content such as \"Purpose of Movement\", and the functional electrical stimulation or exoskeleton drive of the paralyzed limb is triggered after the decision of the Purpose layer, so that the patient can generate actual motor feedback. At the same time, the cognitive feedback module gives encouraging prompts according to the patient's concentration and other indicators, forming a two-way closed-loop training. During the whole process, the changes in the patient's limb motor function score, cerebral cortex excitatory recombination (assessed by TMS evoked potential) and other indicators were monitored. Assuming that this system can significantly improve the training effect compared with traditional rehabilitation methods, we will quantify: for example, compared with the control group, the Fugl-Meyer motor score in the closed-loop group is more improved, and the functional connectivity of the brain network is more significantly restored. Experiments will also verify the safety of the system, such as the absence of infection at the electrode implantation site and the absence of error-free over-excitation of artificial conscious decision-making (meta-monitoring should be avoidable). This will lay the groundwork for large-scale clinical trials in the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Epilepsy Intervention Application Validation:</strong> To test the effect of closed-loop systems on seizures in clinical monitoring units or animal models of refractory epilepsy. For implanted epilepsy patients, intraoperative or postoperative cortical electrodes are used to connect to the artificial consciousness system: the artificial consciousness chip continuously analyzes the patient's EEG, and when it detects changes in the early epilepsy network, it triggers local electrical stimulation with the purpose of \"inhibiting abnormal activities\" to try to prevent the spread of seizures. In addition, the system will assess the patient's state of consciousness at that time, and if the patient is awake and anxious, the cognitive feedback module may give soothing instructions to help the patient relax. This combination of hard and soft intervention strategy will evaluate the efficacy during a certain observation period, including changes in the frequency and duration of attacks, and assessment of the patient's cognitive function (to ensure that there are no significant side effects). If animal experiments are conducted, seizures can be induced in animals and closed-loop stimulation intervention can be performed to record the effect of stimulation on neuronal firing and behavioral performance during the seizure. The expected result is that closed-loop artificial consciousness systems are able to reduce the number and intensity of seizures, and even reduce seizure susceptibility after a period of time due to changes in network plasticity. We will also check the reliability of the system, such as the stability of long-term operation, the electrode does not shift and other engineering indicators.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Key Innovations and Values:</em> In this section, we will put the above theories and models into practice to build the world's first closed-loop brain-computer interface prototype that integrates artificial consciousness. Its innovation lies in the integration of a number of self-developed components (DIKWP chip, semantic decoding, cognitive feedback) to form a complete system, realizing the real sense of human-machine integration closed-loop control. Through testing in rehabilitation and disease intervention scenarios, we will validate the effectiveness of this new paradigm and provide direct evidence for future clinical translation. If successful, it means that for the first time, patients can use a \"conscious\" intelligent BCI system to accelerate brain recovery or inhibit disease progression, which is of epoch-making significance.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Technical-roadmap-and-system-architecture-diagram\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Technical-roadmap-and-system-architecture-diagram\" title=\"Technical roadmap and system architecture diagram\"></a><strong>Technical roadmap and system architecture diagram</strong></h1><p><strong>Technical route:</strong> This project adopts the progressive technical route of \"basic research→ model simulation→ prototype realization →application verification\", and each stage is connected and gradually deepened to form a closed-loop R&amp;D process. Firstly, in the basic research stage, we discovered the brain plasticity mechanism and pathological network characteristics through biological experiments and data analysis, which provided a scientific basis for the construction of artificial consciousness control strategies. Then, in the model simulation stage, the DIKWP artificial consciousness-driven control algorithm was developed, and the effect of the algorithm was simulated and verified in the multi-level brain model and the DIKWP interaction model, so as to optimize the algorithm parameters and model assumptions, so that the scheme became mature before being put into hardware implementation. Then, in the engineering implementation stage, the chip and system integration problems were overcome, the prototype of the closed-loop brain-computer interface was developed, and its function was tested on the in vitro bench. Finally, in the application validation stage, the prototype was used for animal experiments and small-sample human trials, <strong>closed-loop evaluation of the actual intervention effect and safety, and</strong> the research of the feedback and feedback mechanism and algorithm improvement were obtained. This technical route uses theory to guide practice, and uses experimental results to calibrate theoretical assumptions, gradually reduce risks, and ensure the realization of the ultimate goal of the project.</p>\n<p><strong>System architecture:</strong> Figure 1 shows the overall architecture of the closed-loop brain-computer interface system of this project. The system consists of implanted multi-channel EEG electrodes, <strong>DIKWP artificial awareness chip</strong>, <strong>cognitive feedback module and external control terminal. The workflow is as follows: first, implanted electrodes collect nerve signals (data layers) in the cerebral cortex or deep part, and transmit them to the artificial consciousness chip through signal conditioning; The semantic decoding module built into the chip converts the original signal into useful information and knowledge features (information</strong>/knowledge layer), and then the inference engine combines the existing built-in model and the current context to evaluate the brain state in the Wisdom layer. The highest Purpose layer makes decisions based on a stated goal (recovery or suppression of seizures), such as the need to enhance the excitability of a circuit or inhibit abnormal activity. On the one hand, the decision-making signal is sent to the stimulus control module, which drives the implanted electrode to perform electrical stimulation (output to the brain) to the target area. On the other hand, it is sent to a cognitive feedback module and provided to the patient in the form of visual, auditory or tactile perceptions. As a result, patients receive feedback about their own state or training tasks, which generate corresponding cognitive responses in the brain (such as concentration or emotional comfort), which in turn affect brain signals and form a second feedback pathway. The system also contains a metacognitive monitoring unit, which independently monitors the decision output and physiological parameters of the artificial consciousness chip: when an abnormality is detected (such as a decision outside the safety boundary), the parameters can be corrected in real time or the safety mode can be triggered to avoid adverse events. The entire architecture supports two-way information flow: both from the brain to the machine uplink (Purpose decoding) and from the machine to the brain downlink (stimulation and feedback), supplemented by internal self-supervision, to truly achieve a safe and adaptive human-machine closed loop.</p>\n<p>The system architecture embodies the research results of the project: it embodies the layer-by-layer processing and purpose guidance of the DIKWP model from the algorithm, and integrates the coordinated operation of sensing, computing, stimulation and feedback components from the engineering perspective. Through the clear display of the architecture diagram, we will guide the actual equipment development accordingly, and ensure that the interface of each module is clear and the functions are complete.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Task-breakdown-with-a-three-year-timetable\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Task-breakdown-with-a-three-year-timetable\" title=\"Task breakdown with a three-year timetable\"></a><strong>Task breakdown with a three-year timetable</strong></h1><p>In order to move the project forward, we broke down the research tasks into several modules, which were completed in phases over a period of three years:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Stage 1 (Year 1):</strong> The core lies in the basic theory and model preparation.

We will conduct an assessment at the end of each phase to ensure that the project is on track and that the plan is adjusted in a timely manner for risk factors (see the Risk Assessment section below).</p>\n<h1 id=\"Pseudocode-and-key-module-design-instructions\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Pseudocode-and-key-module-design-instructions\" title=\"Pseudocode and key module design instructions\"></a><strong>Pseudocode and key module design instructions</strong></h1><p>In order to better describe the closed-loop control algorithm based on the DIKWP model, this section provides pseudocode of the main processes and the design description of the key modules.</p>\n<p><strong>1.

It develops a specific intervention plan based on the system's set goal (e.g., restoring a function, reducing the probability of seizures) and the Wisdom assessment provided by the Evaluator, which includes stimulation parameters, feedback content, etc. Decisions can also carry semantic tags for feedback modules.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Stimulator.apply_stimulation(): Stimulation output module that converts parameters in decision-making into physical stimuli to the brain/peripherals, such as electrical stimulation waveforms, robot movements, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>FeedbackModule.provide_feedback(): A cognitive feedback module that translates the purpose of decision-making into a form that is perceived by the patient, such as prompting the patient to \"force the image of a fist\" through voice, or presenting real-time results on the screen to motivate practice.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Monitor.detect_anomaly () of the meta-circulation part: The metacognitive monitoring module reviews the output and input signals of the main cycle in real time to determine whether there is any abnormality (such as continuous stimulation does not achieve the expected effect, abnormal physiological indicators of patients, etc.). Once found, execute Deliberator.adjust_parameters () to adjust the internal policy or trigger the security mode, skipping the current cycle to avoid error accumulation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Learner.update_internal_model(): A self-learning module that updates internal model parameters, such as strategy optimization or model calibration, based on long-term feedback results (e.g., functional assessment after multiple trainings, or changes in seizure frequency after several weeks) to continuously improve system performance.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Key module design description:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Multimodal Semantic Decoding Module:</strong> This module corresponds to the data → information conversion of the DIKWP model, and is designed to integrate traditional signal processing and deep learning methods. In order to improve robustness, we use multi-modal data fusion: not only EEG/eco-electrical signals can be processed, but also auxiliary information such as electromyography and heart rate can be accessed. Time-frequency features are extracted through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and classified by semantic tags in the knowledge base (e.g., \"trying to move the left hand\" for a specific EEG pattern). The information output by the module comes with a preliminary semantic description that can be used for subsequent decision-making. The innovation lies in the introduction of semantic annotation training, so that the low-level signal processing directly serves the high-level meaning interpretation, rather than only extracting statistical features.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>DIKWP Decision Engine (Deliberator):</strong> This is the \"brain\" of the system, which implements the core function of artificial consciousness. The design uses a combination of rule-based inference <strong>+ reinforcement learning optimization: the initial rules are determined by expert knowledge and DIKWP theory, e.g. \"If a patient is detected to have a fist</strong> Purpose but no actual movement, electrical stimulation is sent\"; At the same time, reinforcement learning algorithms are introduced to allow the system to adjust the intensity and timing of stimuli in iterative experiments to optimize long-term returns (such as functional improvement). The decision engine is implemented in five layers corresponding to the DIKWP structure, and the output of each layer is reserved for logging and monitoring to ensure transparency and explainability. For example, when the system decides to increase the intensity of the stimulus, it can be traced back to the knowledge layer that \"signs of fatigue have been detected\", the Wisdom layer that determines that \"the current training effect has decreased\", and the Purpose layer increases the intensity accordingly to maintain the target progress. Such a design guarantees interpretable semantics at every step of the decision.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Metacognitive Monitoring &amp; Security Module:</strong> This module monitors the operation of the system at all times, independent of the main decision-making process. The implementation adopts a dual-threaded architecture, with one main thread performing the above closed-loop loop and the other monitoring thread performing rule checks on key variables. For example, the stimulus output is monitored for exceeding the safe limit, for abnormally high decision-making frequency, and for dramatic changes in the patient's physiological signals (e.g., heart rate). If any of the safety rules are triggered, the monitoring module immediately takes over: pauses the stimulus output, switches the system to safe mode (e.g. maintains the minimum safe stimulus or stops completely), and alarms the external terminal. The main cycle is resumed only after the parameters are adjusted and confirmed to be correct. This mechanism ensures that there is a second line of defense for patient safety, even in cases where artificial awareness algorithms can go wrong.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Cognitive Feedback Engine:</strong> Traditional BCI is often presented with simple visual or auditory feedback, such as cursor movement, success sound, etc. The feedback engine of this system uses the semantic output of DIKWP to design richer interactive feedback. For example, when the patient's attention is distracted and the training effect decreases, the system detects this high-level state, and the feedback engine can voice remind \"please concentrate and imagine arm movements\"; For example, when a patient is frustrated, soothing music can be played or a message of encouragement can be displayed on the interface. This kind of feedback goes beyond the notification of simple task results and <strong>integrates the guidance of the patient's psychological and cognitive state</strong>, which helps to mobilize the patient's subjective initiative and form a real human-in-the-loop training. The module needs to work closely with the decision-making engine to select the appropriate feedback strategy based on the output of the Purpose layer to achieve situational adaptation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, the pseudocode and module design reflect the logical architecture of the software and hardware systems of this project. It can be seen that the DIKWP artificial consciousness model runs through all aspects of data processing, decision-making and feedback, so that the system has the ability to process from low-level signals to high-level semantics, as well as the learning ability from short-term response to long-term adaptation. These designs provide a guarantee for the realization of system functions and the achievement of innovation goals.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Team-composition-and-division-of-responsibilities\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Team-composition-and-division-of-responsibilities\" title=\"Team composition and division of responsibilities\"></a><strong>Team composition and division of responsibilities</strong></h1><p>This project is led by the Active Medicine Committee of the World Association of Artificial Consciousness and completed with the collaboration of several units.

Hold regular project team meetings (once a month, once a quarter, once a general meeting), and the person in charge will coordinate and discuss and solve cross-disciplinary problems. Through the above mechanisms, the project is ensured to advance with high quality as planned and produce the expected results.</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"Risk-assessment-and-response-strategies\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Risk-assessment-and-response-strategies\" title=\"Risk assessment and response strategies\"></a><strong>Risk assessment and response strategies</strong></h1><p>This project has a high degree of cross-innovation, involving biology, engineering, AI and other aspects, and there are certain technical and implementation risks. We have assessed the key risk points and developed the following response strategies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>**Technical risk 1: Difficulty in decoding and semantic brain signals. **Brain signals are noisy and vary from person to person, making it challenging to convert massive amounts of neural data into explicit semantic information. <em>Strategy:</em> Multi-channel and multi-modal fusion are introduced to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and the combination of advanced signal processing and deep learning is used to extract robust features. At the same time, an individualized baseline is established in advance: the resting and task status data of each subject are collected to train a customized decoding model and improve the recognition accuracy of gesture purpose. If it is still not ideal, we reserve the solution to simplify the semantic decoding requirements and extract a small number of key biomarker signals (such as specific band power) to ensure the operation of the basic functions of the system and buy time for subsequent optimization.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>**Technical risk 2: Insufficient stability and real-time performance of closed-loop control. **Artificial consciousness algorithms need to parse brain signals and output stimulus decisions in milliseconds. Response lag or algorithm divergence may occur in complex environments. <em>Solution:</em> Algorithm optimization and hardware acceleration are used to ensure real-time performance. On the one hand, the model calculation is simplified, and the parallel computing characteristics of FPGA/ASIC are used to realize the pipeline processing of key steps. On the other hand, stability constraints are introduced: the restriction on the rate of change of the decision and the smoothing filter are added to the algorithm to avoid large output oscillations. Metacognitive monitoring acts as a guarantee, and if multiple consecutive decision instabilities are detected, the closed-loop gain will be automatically reduced or temporarily switched to safe mode. In addition, parameters are adjusted during the simulation and animal testing phases to ensure that the system is stable and fast before human testing.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>**Scientific risks: The mechanism of brain plasticity is not obvious or the results are not as expected. **The plasticity effects induced by brain-computer interfaces are complex, and significant changes may be difficult to observe in a limited time. <em>Coping strategy:</em> Expand the sample size and observation indicators, and verify the plastic change by multiple means. For example, adding histological assays (e.g., synaptic protein expression) in animal experiments, extending follow-up time in human experiments, and improving detection capabilities with highly sensitive EEG/imaging indicators. Criteria should also be developed: if the primary hypothesis (e.g., closed-loop training promotes enhanced functional connectivity) is not validated, we will adjust the experimental parameters (e.g., increase the training frequency, change the stimulation pattern), or re-analyze for different patient subgroups to find a more pronounced pattern of effect. Since we are studying two types of diseases (stroke and epilepsy) at the same time, when the results in one direction are not good, the findings in the other direction can still support the value of the project, and we will also summarize the negative results and refine the lessons learned.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>**Engineering risk: the development of artificial consciousness chips is delayed or the performance is not up to standard. **The design and manufacture of special chips are complex, and problems such as tape-out failure and excessive power consumption may be encountered. <em>Strategy:</em> Use the FPGA platform as a transition, and use the FPGA debug function while designing the ASIC. Even if the chip is delayed, we can use an external FPGA+ computer to simulate the chip function in the short term, so as to ensure that other work does not stop. In addition, we cooperate with experienced chip companies to conduct small-scale tape-out tests and module-level verification in advance to put risks in advance. For power consumption and heat generation, we design with sufficient redundancy, such as adding a heat sink to the package and supporting dynamic frequency adjustment in the algorithm, to ensure that even if the performance is slightly lower than expected, the system will not be seriously affected.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>**Experiments and ethical risks: Accidents in animal or human trials. **Implantable electrodes can cause infection or tissue damage, and closed-loop stimulation has the potential to induce unintended responses. <em>Coping Strategies:</em> Adhere to the principle of ethical priority and gradual progress. In the animal experiment stage, sterile surgery and postoperative care should be carried out in strict accordance with the requirements of animal ethics, and an observation period should be set up to assess safety before proceeding to the next step. Human trials are conducted only after adequate animal validation, safety evaluation, and ethics committee approval, and initially only in a very small number of critically ill patients, in hospital ICUs or custodial settings, so that adverse events can be managed at any time. Establish a detailed emergency plan in advance, including guidelines for emergency stop (e.g., immediate shutdown of the device in the event of persistent seizures or abnormal heart rhythms), medical procedures, and division of responsibilities. In the event of any accidents, start planning immediately to minimize risks and injuries. The project also sets up an independent supervisory committee to regularly review the safety data of the trial, and recommend adjusting or discontinuing the trial if necessary to ensure that the study does not deviate from the ethical bottom line.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>**People and management risk: Poor collaboration or personnel turnover in interdisciplinary teams. **The team involves multiple units and fields, and poor communication may delay progress; Changes in key personnel can also have a shock. <em>Coping strategies:</em> Establish an efficient project management system, communicate and report progress regularly, and use project management software to share information and plans. The project manager coordinates the schedule and identifies coordination problems in a timely manner. For key technical positions, assign deputies or echelons, for example, at least two people in each sub-project to master the core technology, so as to prevent work continuity when personnel leave their posts. Through regular training and brainstorming, the team understands the understanding of the team, so that the engineers understand some medicine, and the doctors also understand the basics of algorithms, so as to reduce communication barriers. Provide competitive support for key personnel in terms of funds, enhance team cohesion, and strive to maintain stability of core members during the project cycle.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, we have fully identified the challenges that may be encountered in the project and prepared a multi-layered response. Relying on the advantages of multi-disciplinary and pre-research foundation, I believe that various risks can be reduced to a controllable range and the project tasks can be successfully completed.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Budget-structure-and-description-of-funding\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Budget-structure-and-description-of-funding\" title=\"Budget structure and description of funding\"></a><strong>Budget structure and description of funding</strong></h1><p>The total amount of funds to be applied for this project is XXX million yuan, which will be reasonably allocated to various expenditure subjects according to the needs of the research task.

In addition, the management fee drawn according to the requirements of the relying unit is also included (if there is an upper limit, it will be withdrawn according to the regulations).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Reserve (about 5%):</strong> Establish an appropriate percentage of flexible funds to cover unforeseen expenses or price fluctuations.

The focus of capital investment is inclined to the development of hardware equipment and core technology research, which is the material basis for project innovation. Personnel funds are also fully supported to attract and stabilize high-level talents. The proportion of each expenditure will be implemented in detail according to the actual progress, and we will use the funds in strict accordance with the management measures for scientific research funds to improve the efficiency of the use of funds. It is expected that through the reasonable investment of the project funds, high-value innovation results can be produced and value for money.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Expected-outcomes-and-societal-value\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Expected-outcomes-and-societal-value\" title=\"Expected outcomes and societal value\"></a><strong>Expected outcomes and societal value</strong></h1><p>After three years of research, the project will achieve a series of innovative results in scientific research and technology application, which are expected as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Theoretical innovations:</strong> Elucidate the mechanism of brain-computer interface-induced brain plasticity, and propose and verify the theoretical framework of artificial consciousness intervention to promote brain network reconstruction for the first time in the world. It is expected to publish 5~8 high-level academic papers, including about 2 in the field of neuroscience and about 2 in top journals of artificial intelligence. This paper will report in detail the effects and mechanisms of closed-loop interventions in stroke and epilepsy models, and the principles of DIKWP artificial consciousness algorithms, laying a new theoretical foundation for this interdisciplinary field. At the same time, we plan to give a presentation at the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Brain Science, and launch the theoretical concept of \"DIKWP Consciousness Closed Loop\" to enhance academic influence.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Key technical standards and evaluation indicators:</strong> Formulate technical specifications and effect evaluation standards for closed-loop brain-computer interface cognitive feedback training. For example, a set of evaluation indicators has been established in stroke rehabilitation, including the improvement rate of motor function scales and the rate of brain network connection enhancement, to measure the efficacy of intelligent BCI therapy. In epilepsy intervention, new indicators, such as the synchronicity reduction index of seizure network, were proposed to evaluate the improvement of brain network brought about by closed-loop intervention. These indicators and evaluation methods are expected to be incorporated into industry guidelines or standard documents to fill the gap in the evaluation of the effect of intelligent closed-loop neuromodulation. We will work with industry associations to promote standardization later in the project.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Invention patents and intellectual property rights:</strong> Focusing on the application of DIKWP artificial consciousness in brain-computer interface, we expect to apply for no less than 10 invention patents. The key points include: artificial consciousness chip architecture design, electrode parameter semantic plasticity control method, metacognitive security monitoring mechanism, etc. These patents will build a complete pool of independent intellectual property rights and provide legal protection for future productization. In consideration of international competition, we will also apply for PCT patents and strive to have a presence in major markets around the world. The patent achievements condense the core innovation of the project, which can establish a first-mover advantage for China in the field of intelligent brain-computer integration.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Prototype system and demonstration application:</strong> Delivered 1 set of bidirectional closed-loop brain-computer interface prototype system, including implantable hardware and supporting software. The system achieves at least TRL (Technology Maturity) level 4-5, i.e. key functions have been validated in the lab and in a simulation environment. We will demonstrate the application in the rehabilitation center and epilepsy center: show the paralyzed patients re-realize simple limb movements with the help of the system, and the epilepsy patients can significantly reduce their seizures through the system. A demonstration GUI interface will also be developed to display the artificial consciousness decision-making process (data, information, knowledge, wisdom, purpose) in real time for scientific research teaching and popular science. This prototype will be used as a prototype for subsequent clinical product development, and its component modules (such as artificial consciousness chips) can also be transplanted to other biomedical devices, which has important extended application value.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Talent training and team building:</strong> During the implementation of the project, more than 10 interdisciplinary talents will be cultivated. It is expected to complete the training of 3-4 doctoral and postdoctoral fellows, who will master the cross-skills of brain-computer interface, artificial intelligence and neuroscience, and become a new force in this field in China. The team is expected to further cohesion into a continuous innovation team through cooperation, and continue to tackle key problems together after the end of the project, so that the supporting unit can maintain an international leading position in the direction of the integration of artificial consciousness and brain science.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Socio-economic value:</strong> From the perspective of social benefits, this project provides new hope for rehabilitation and treatment for stroke and refractory epilepsy patients. If the results are transformed and applied, it will help thousands of stroke patients who have lost their ability to exercise to recover their independence faster and better, and reduce the burden on their families and society. It can also reduce seizures, improve quality of life for epilepsy patients, and reduce accidental injuries and medical expenses caused by seizures. Its potential social value is immeasurable. In terms of economic benefits, intelligent brain-computer rehabilitation and neuromodulation equipment are hot spots in emerging industries, and the global market space is broad. Once our team's technology matures, it can incubate high-tech enterprises and form an industrial chain from chips to medical devices. With the original advantages of DIKWP artificial awareness, our products will be internationally competitive and are expected to occupy a certain share of the high-end rehabilitation medical device market and generate considerable economic returns. More importantly, the project has achieved a breakthrough in the implementation of artificial intelligence technology in the field of medical and health care, responding to the dual needs of the \"Healthy China\" strategy and the development of digital technology, and demonstrating the huge potential of artificial intelligence to empower medical care.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, this project will produce a wealth of results, from scientific theory to practical system, with clear layers and mutual support. These achievements not only push the academic frontier, but also effectively serve major clinical needs. We believe that the successful implementation of the project will establish China's international leading position in the field of artificial consciousness and brain-computer interface integration, bring tangible benefits to patients, and have a far-reaching impact on the development of related industries and society.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

The incidence of neuropathic pain in the global population is about 7%~10%, and due to the lack of effective radical treatment, the quality of life of patients has declined for a long time. At present, most of the available analgesic treatments are mainly symptomatic, and it is difficult to completely solve the pain problem from the mechanism. Similarly, chronic pruritus is more than 20% prevalent in the elderly population, and the treatment of unexplained pruritus and intractable pruritus presents significant challenges. Traditional analgesic drugs (e.g., opioids) have limited efficacy and significant side effects, and abuse can lead to addiction and other social problems; Although neuromodulation techniques (such as spinal cord stimulation) provide new approaches, most of the existing devices are open loops or simple feedback, lack of intelligent decision-making ability, and efficacy optimization still mainly relies on manual experience. It can be seen that <strong>there is an urgent scientific research and industrial need in the analysis of the mechanism of pain/itching and the innovation of intervention strategies.</strong></p>\n<p>At present, advances in artificial intelligence and bioelectronics technology bring new hope to solve this problem. For example, the exploration of implantable smart chips for pain management has emerged: the INS2 implantable neurostimulation sensor chip developed in Australia can monitor spinal nerve pain signals in real time and release pulses to block signal transmission when pain is detected, thereby relieving pain. This technology is thought to have the potential to revolutionize chronic pain treatment. Another example is the AI analgesic pump system that has emerged in China, which applies the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence to postoperative analgesia management, which can monitor the medication in real time, intelligently warn of insufficient or excessive analgesia, and realize the objective quantification of subjective pain feelings. These advances show that <strong>intelligent and closed-loop pain intervention is the future development trend. However, the current system is still mainly at the signal or data-driven level, and does not make full use of the high-level understanding of \"pain semantics\" and \"consciousness factors\", and it is difficult to adapt to individual differences or complex situations in a timely manner. Pain and itching are not only physiological signals, but also involve</strong> high-level semantic factors such as cognition, emotion, and purpose—e.g., anxiety exacerbates the experience of pain, and distraction relieves itching. This suggests that a novel strategy that integrates AI semantic understanding and biofeedback modulation is needed to resolve and intervene in pain/pruritus at a higher level.</p>\n<p><strong>The significance of this project is to introduce the latest artificial consciousness theory and semantic modeling methods, treat pain</strong>/itching as a semantic phenomenon that is inconsistent with the human body's information and purpose, and develop an active closed-loop intelligent intervention system to improve the level of pain/itch management from the root. By combining the DIKWP artificial consciousness model, the concept of active medicine, and the artificial consciousness processing unit (ACPU) architecture proposed by Professor Yucong Duan, we hope to break through the traditional analgesic thinking and achieve the following goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Re-examine pain/pruritus from the mechanism level, model it as a semantic deviation phenomenon, deepen the understanding of the mechanism of pain occurrence, perception and regulation, and provide a new paradigm for medical research.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>At the technical level, an autonomous intelligent analgesia system is built, which integrates chips, algorithms and neural interfaces, which can perceive the semantics of the patient's pain status, intelligently decide on the analgesic plan and implement intervention, forming a closed loop of \"perception-cognition-regulation\", and improving the accuracy and individualization of analgesic treatment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>At the industrial level, we will develop domestic analgesic chips and AI dispensing systems with independent intellectual property rights, create an overall solution for pain intervention that can be implemented, seize the opportunity in the emerging field of intelligent medicine, meet major clinical needs and drive the development of related industries.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, this project closely follows the national key R&amp;D direction (mechanism and intervention of pain and pruritus diseases), integrates artificial intelligence and biomedical frontier theories, and has important scientific value, as well as significant clinical translation significance and market prospects.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Theoretical-Basis-and-Model-Architecture\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Theoretical-Basis-and-Model-Architecture\" title=\"Theoretical Basis and Model Architecture\"></a><strong>Theoretical Basis and Model Architecture</strong></h1><p>This project will take the DIKWP artificial consciousness model as the core theoretical basis, and combine the artificial consciousness processing unit (<strong>ACPU) architecture and active medicine concept to establish a</strong> semantic cognitive model and intervention framework for pain/itching. The key theories and models are described below:</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-DIKWP-Model-and-the-Theory-of-Artificial-Consciousness\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#The-DIKWP-Model-and-the-Theory-of-Artificial-Consciousness\" title=\"The DIKWP Model and the Theory of Artificial Consciousness\"></a><strong>The DIKWP Model</strong> <strong>and the Theory of Artificial Consciousness</strong></h2><p>The DIKWP model is a new generation of artificial consciousness cognitive framework proposed by Professor Yucong Duan's team, which adds a \"Purpose\" layer on the basis of the classic DIKW (Pyramid) model (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom). Different from linear hierarchies, DIKWP realizes bidirectional feedback and iterative update of the semantics of each layer through a mesh structure. This model aims to simulate the complete process of human consciousness from low-level perception to high-level decision-making: starting from the raw data (D), distilling information (I), knowledge (K) and wisdom (W) layer by layer, and finally rising to the Purpose (P) layer; In turn, the purpose and wisdom of the higher levels guide the selection and interpretation of low-level data and information, thus forming a closed-loop cognitive cycle.</p>\n<p>The DIKWP model gives AI systems a \"common cognitive language\" that allows every step of the decision to be tracked and explained. In particular, the introduction of the \"Purpose/Purpose\" layer allows AI decision-making to embed human value goals to ensure that AI behavior is aligned with human Purpose. In the study of artificial consciousness, the DIKWP model is regarded as an important way to realize machine self-awareness and explainable decision-making: through mathematical modeling of each layer of semantic process, the machine can simulate the cognitive and conscious functions of humans, and disclose the purpose and value evolution behind each step of reasoning. Prof. Yucong Duan noted, \"The DIKWP model builds a common cognitive language between humans and machines, making every step of the AI decision traceable, interpreted, and understood by humans. By embedding the key layer of 'purpose' into the model, we can not only make AI smarter, but also ensure that it remains in service of human values and safety needs.\" “</p>\n<p><strong>Mesh DIKWP and the \"Conscious Bug\" Theory:</strong> Yucong Duan and his team further developed the DIKWP model, proposing to incorporate both human subconscious and conscious processes into the model architecture. They divide the DIKWP hierarchy into parallel subconscious and conscious streams to more realistically simulate human cognitive mechanisms. At the same time, the \"consciousness bug theory\" is proposed, which believes that the emergence and evolution of consciousness are related to the process of constantly discovering and correcting one's own cognitive biases (bugs). When there is a \"purpose shift\" or deviation in information processing, it can trigger awareness and adjustment of consciousness. Drawing on this idea, this project argues that pain**/itching can be seen as a \"deviation\" or \"error\" signal between the body's message and purpose**, which needs to be corrected by introducing higher cognitive feedback (artificial awareness). This is discussed in more detail in the semantic model of pain below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ACPU-architecture-Artificial-awareness-processing-unit\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#ACPU-architecture-Artificial-awareness-processing-unit\" title=\"ACPU architecture: Artificial awareness processing unit\"></a><strong>ACPU architecture: Artificial awareness processing unit</strong></h2><p>The Artificial Consciousness Processing Unit (<strong>ACPU</strong>) is a dedicated intelligent architecture designed based on the DIKWP model, which can be understood as a chip or modular system embedded in the artificial consciousness model. ACPU aims to realize the <strong>processing flow of data-information-knowledge-wisdom-purpose at the hardware level</strong>, and realize cognitive functions similar to human consciousness. The core idea is to add cognitive processing units to the traditional computing architecture, so that the machine has the \"self-knowledge\" of its own computing process and a high-level semantic understanding of external information.</p>\n<p>According to the literature, ACPU as a whole consists of three core modules: one is the subliminal computing unit (<strong>SCU),</strong> which corresponds to the parallel processing of the lower levels (data and information) in the DIKWP model, which is responsible for extracting features and semantic patterns from sensor inputs, emphasizing high throughput and heterogeneous computing (such as using GPU to accelerate parallel computing); The second is the Consciousness Decision Unit (<strong>CDU),</strong> which corresponds to the sequential logical reasoning of the high-level (knowledge, wisdom, and purpose), runs on the CPU and other general computing units, and is responsible for comprehensively analyzing semantic information and forming interpretable decisions and purpose outputs. The third is the Semantic Fusion Unit (<strong>SCFU),</strong> which connects the subconscious mind and the conscious unit to realize the two-way interaction and integration of information between the two. This architecture is similar to the coordination between fast unconscious reactions and slow conscious thinking in the human brain: the SCU provides rapid perception and initial response to the environment, the CDU conducts in-depth evaluation and purpose generation, and the SCFU continuously compares the two to ensure overall consistency and efficiency.</p>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that the ACPU architecture embodies the idea of \"perception-cognition-regulation\" <strong>integrated semantic engine: the external input is semantic processed by the perception module, enters the cognitive decision-making module for high-level understanding and planning, and then outputs to the control execution module to complete specific intervention actions to achieve closed-loop control. This is a good fit for the process we need in our pain intervention (which will be discussed later in the context of the specific protocol). In general,</strong> ACPU provides a technical blueprint for this project: we can design software and hardware systems based on the ACPU concept, so that they have the ability to complete the whole process from pain signal acquisition, semantic understanding, to intervention execution.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-concept-of-active-medicine-and-the-DIKWP-active-semantic-framework\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#The-concept-of-active-medicine-and-the-DIKWP-active-semantic-framework\" title=\"The concept of active medicine and the DIKWP active semantic framework\"></a><strong>The concept of active medicine and the DIKWP active semantic framework</strong></h2><p><strong>Active medicine is a</strong> new medical concept proposed by Professor Yucong Duan in recent years, the core of which is to make full use of AI and artificial consciousness technology in the diagnosis and treatment process to realize the transformation from passive treatment to active health management. Compared with traditional medicine, which passively responds to patients' symptoms, proactive medicine emphasizes prediction, prevention, and personalized intervention, enabling the medical system to actively sense the patient's status and adjust the plan in time. The DIKWP model plays a key role in active medicine and is used to construct multi-level semantic portraits of patients and decision support systems.</p>\n<p>Yucong Duan et al. proposed that the DIKWP cognitive map could be constructed for each patient, and the objective data of the patient (D), the subjective symptoms and descriptions (I), the relevant medical knowledge (K), the doctor's diagnosis and treatment ideas (W) and the patient's health goals (P) could be integrated to form a complete semantic description of the patient's health status. Then, the individual graph was semantically compared with the standard knowledge graph in the medical field (\"standard medical knowledge DIKWP graph\") to find the difference between the two. These differences reflect deviations from the patient's health or desired state, i.e., issues that require attention and intervention. For example, by comparing a patient's symptoms and test results to a standard diagnostic knowledge base, overlooked diagnostic clues or inconsistencies can be identified to aid in a more comprehensive treatment plan. This process ensures that the patient's subjective feelings and individual differences are not overlooked, but are integrated into the AI's decision-making basis.</p>\n<p>Under the framework of active medicine, AI (especially AI systems with initial human awareness) not only participates in data analysis, but can also simulate doctor-patient interactions and internal cognitive processes. By introducing an artificial consciousness model into the cognitive space, AI can map the external doctor-patient communication and internal thought process into computable reasoning steps in the DIKWP model. To put it simply, AI is trained to be a \"virtual expert\" who understands both modern medicine and the individual needs of patients, and forms a decision-making team with human doctors. This human-machine convergence of wisdom can bridge the limitations of a single subject's knowledge or perspective, and provide more comprehensive and accurate decision support. More importantly, no matter how intelligent AI is, the final decision must be guided by the ultimate interests of patients (the purpose layer), and both humans and AI should follow medical ethics and humanistic concepts. This ensures that active medicine still aims to \"treat diseases and save lives\", with the help of AI but without deviating from humanistic care.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: Based</strong> on the above theories, this project will take the semantic stratification and feedback mechanism provided by the DIKWP model as the ideological basis, use the sensory-cognitive-regulatory closed loop provided by the ACPU architecture <strong>as the technical blueprint, and implement the patient-centered principle of active medicine to design our pain</strong>/itch intervention system. In the following, we will describe in detail how to integrate the pain/itch problem into the above theoretical framework, and establish the corresponding semantic model and feedback control strategy.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Semantic-modeling-of-pain-pruritus-with-active-intervention-mechanisms\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Semantic-modeling-of-pain-pruritus-with-active-intervention-mechanisms\" title=\"Semantic modeling of pain/pruritus with active intervention mechanisms\"></a><strong>Semantic modeling of pain/pruritus with active intervention mechanisms</strong></h1><p>This project innovatively proposes to model pain (including itching) as the phenomenon of \"information-purpose deviation\" in the semantic space of DIKWP, and model the intervention treatment process as \"semantic-driven regulation\".<strong>Feedback closed loop. To put it simply, we see pain/itching as an important \"semantic message\" sent by the body to the brain/consciousness layer, and when this information is inconsistent with the normal purpose or target state of the body, it manifests itself as a painful experience; Our intervention strategy is to correct this deviation at the semantic level and realign the information with the purpose. In this part, we construct a semantic model of pain/pruritus, and</strong> design an intelligent mechanism for active intervention based on the three-layer structure of \"somatic semantic self-perception-external semantic interpretation-interactive consensus\".</p>\n<h2 id=\"DIKWP-semantic-space-model-of-pain-pruritus\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#DIKWP-semantic-space-model-of-pain-pruritus\" title=\"DIKWP semantic space model of pain/pruritus\"></a><strong>DIKWP semantic space model of pain/pruritus</strong></h2><p>In the DIKWP semantic space, we can describe the process of producing pain or itching experiences with a five-layer structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Data Layer (D):</strong> Raw signal and physiological data corresponding to pain/itching. For example, the electrical signals generated when nociceptors are stimulated, the frequency of impulses that cause C-fiber conduction caused by skin stimulation, and changes in the level of inflammatory factors. This is the lowest level of objective data, the material basis for the production of pain/itching.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Information layer (I):</strong> corresponds to the preliminary processing and characterization of these raw signals, i.e., pain**/itch information**. For example, after the signal is screened and encoded by the posterior horn of the spinal cord and the thalamus, the ascending pathway sends sensory information about \"pain\" or \"itching\" to the brain, including intensity, location, nature, etc. There are already certain semantics here, such as \"thumb tingling\" and \"back itching\", which are the manifestations after the data has given preliminary meaning.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Knowledge layer (K):</strong> corresponds to knowledge, memory, and pattern recognition related to pain/itching. This includes the individual's past experience (what it means to have similar pain in the past), medical knowledge (what may be the cause of the pain), and cultural and psychological factors (such as knowing whether the itching and scratching will relieve or worsen). At this level, the brain compares the current pain and itch information with the existing knowledge base. For example, \"sharp stabbing pain + redness\" matches \"may be pain due to infectious inflammation\", or \"paroxysmal shock-like pain\" matches \"may be neuropathic pain\". The knowledge layer gives a deeper semantic explanation to pain/itching – pain is no longer just a signal, but is associated with a meaning or cause.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Wisdom Layer (W):</strong> Comprehensive assessment and decision-making in response to pain/itch situations. The Wisdom layer reflects the organism/individual's ability to solve problems. For example, after integrating the information at the knowledge level, the brain generates countermeasures: \"This pain may be appendicitis, you need to seek medical attention as soon as possible\" or \"This itch may be a mosquito bite, just apply medicine to relieve the itch\". At this level, the individual also considers the situation: Is there something more urgent at the moment? Is the pain/itching severe enough to interrupt your current activity? The output of the Wisdom layer is a treatment plan or response strategy to a pain/itch stimulus, which already includes value trade-offs and purpose choices.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Purpose layer (P):</strong> corresponds to the ultimate purpose, will, and value orientation of the individual. In a healthy state, people's purpose is usually not to want to have pain, and to pursue disease-free comfort (\"seeking advantages and avoiding disadvantages\" is the basic biological purpose). In the context of the illness, there are also individual goals for treatment (e.g., \"want to relieve pain and regain ability to work\" or \"stay on task even if there is pain\"). The Purpose layer represents the state that an individual wishes to achieve and the choices that are driven by values. At the unconscious level, purpose is also embodied in the body's survival instinct (instinctively avoiding damage and alleviating pain).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to the above model, we consider pain**/itching as** an alarming semantics generated at the higher level when the perception at the data/information level deviates from the goal of the Purpose layer. For example, when tissue damage (D-layer data) triggers intense pain signals (Layer I) and the \"pain-free normal\" state pursued by the Purpose layer is broken, this deviation is identified as \"harmful/abnormal\" by the Knowledge/Wisdom layer, thus presenting itself as a painful experience in consciousness. The purpose of this experience is to prompt the individual to take action to eliminate deviations and restore balance (e.g., to distance themselves from the source of harm or seek medical treatment). Similarly, pruritus, as a secondary warning signal, is usually less semantic than painful (pruritus indicates minor irritation or skin abnormalities, but less urgency than severe pain), but the Purpose layer is still a comfortable state that wants to be itch-free, so pruritus drives the individual to scratch or process to restore the balance of Purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>Message-Purpose Deviation refers to the degree to which the signal information perceived by the body</strong> does not match the individual's expectation/purpose. For example, if a person has the purpose of maintaining good health (no pain or itching), but receives pain information at the moment, it indicates that there has been a significant deviation; Itching also represents some degree of deviation, but may not be as severe as pain. Professor Yucong Duan's \"BUG Theory\" of consciousness believes that the awakening of consciousness often stems from the detection and correction of this bias, and pain/itching is precisely the \"deviation warning mechanism\" evolved by biological consciousness. Therefore, from the perspective of artificial consciousness, we can equate pain/itching with a type of \"bug report\" or \"abnormal semantic markup\" generated within the system, indicating that there is information that is not fit for purpose and needs to be paid attention to and addressed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Semantic-feedback-intervention-structure-for-active-analgesia\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Semantic-feedback-intervention-structure-for-active-analgesia\" title=\"Semantic feedback intervention structure for active analgesia\"></a><strong>Semantic feedback intervention structure for active analgesia</strong></h2><p>After understanding the semantic nature of pain/pruritus, we devise corresponding active intervention mechanisms to regulate and eliminate this information-purpose deviation in a semantic-driven manner. We propose a three-layer interaction structure, corresponding to somatic semantic self-perception, <strong>external semantic interpretation and interactive consensus regulation, to</strong> construct a closed-loop feedback intelligent system from pain perception to intervention execution.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>(1) Somatic semantic self-perception</strong>: This layer emphasizes the patient's own real-time perception and internal feedback of pain/itching. These include the patient's physiological sensations (nerve signaling to the center) and subjective sensations (self-assessment of the degree of distress). In our system, \"somatic self-sensing\" is realized by in-vivo sensors and algorithms: implantable or wearable sensor chips continuously collect physiological data related to pain/itching (such as nerve discharge, electromyography, skin conductance, inflammatory indicators, etc.), which are locally processed by the SCU module of ACPU to extract the semantic features of somatic states—for example, \"the current pain signal intensity is 8/10, derived from the L5 nerve segment; with a stressful increase in heart rate\". This information forms the content of layers D and I in the patient's own DIKWP semantic map, and can be partially elevated to layer K (e.g., in the context of the patient's medical history, it is known that this is \"postoperative wound pain\"). At the same time, the patient's subjective pain score, facial expressions, body movements, etc. are also captured by sensors (cameras, pressure sensing, etc.), enriching the Level I information. Through this layer, the system has a self-perception of the current pain state: it contains both objective physiological signals and subjective semantic descriptions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>(2) External semantic interpretation</strong>: This layer introduces the participation of medical knowledge and external intelligence to semantic interpretation and evaluation of the patient's pain/itching. That is, to construct a \"standard medical knowledge DIKWP map\" <strong>and compare it with the current state of the patient. Our system will be connected to a medical knowledge base (provided by the AI Doctor module or a cloud-based database), which covers multi-level knowledge of pain mechanisms, physiology, treatment methods, etc. (K-layer), as well as expert-trained decision-making rules and ethical constraints (W and P layers). When the patient's semantic state is uploaded from the somatic self-sensing layer, the cognitive decision-making unit (CDU) of the ACPU will call the knowledge base for matching and reasoning: judging the pain</strong>/Possible causes of pruritus, severity, and recommended interventions. For example, the detection of \"high-frequency discharge of L5 nerve segment and severe pain in the patient's subjectivity\" combined with the background knowledge of \"the third postoperative day\" can be interpreted by the system as \"neuralgia caused by inflammation of the surgical incision\". Combined with the knowledge base, this pain mechanism may involve inflammatory mediators and nerve sensitization, and the recommended intervention is a combination of analgesics + anti-inflammatory drugs. For example, for intractable pruritus, the knowledge base may suggest \"consider central pruritus, antihistamine is ineffective, neuromodulation should be tried\", etc. <strong>The external semantic interpretation layer is equivalent to the role of the doctor, which places the patient's information in the medical semantic space for understanding, and outputs the semantic decision of diagnosis and protocol</strong>。 In this process, the DIKWP model ensures the integration of multi-source knowledge: whether it is modern medicine or traditional medical knowledge, it participates in inference through a unified semantic framework. For example, traditional Chinese medicine believes that \"liver fire can cause headaches\", and modern medicine believes that \"trigeminal neuralgia is related to vascular compression\", both of which are expressed as corresponding semantic rules in our knowledge base. When it comes to specific pain, AI can refer to modern knowledge and ignore traditional experience. This makes the explanation of the system more comprehensive.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>(3) Interactive consensus control</strong>: With the information of the patient's own perception and external AI interpretation, the system enters the third layer - <strong>human-computer interaction to reach consensus and implement regulation</strong>。 First of all, after the AI gives the initial intervention plan, it needs to interact with the patient (and the human doctor) to confirm it, which is out of safety and ethical considerations, and is also the embodiment of the \"patient-centered\" nature of active medicine. Specifically, the AI may present the recommendation in natural language or visualization: \"Detecting that you have severe postoperative pain, and recommending an increase in the dose of analgesics and the use of neurostimulation devices to assist, do you agree to do so?\" Patients can respond to their wishes through a human-machine interface. If the patient finds the pain tolerable and does not want to add the drug, the system needs to adjust the regimen (respecting the patient's purpose is an important part of the P layer). With the participation of human doctors, doctors can also review the AI plan and modify it. This consensus interaction process is equivalent to integrating the AI wisdom decision-making with the patient/doctor's subjective wisdom to ensure that the intervention decision is in line with medical ethics and the ultimate benefit of the patient. Once a consensus is reached, the system moves on to the execution stage: mobilizing the semantic-neural <strong>coupling interface to implement precise intervention for the patient. The semantic-neural</strong> coupling interface is one of the key technologies we designed, acting as a translator from semantic instructions to neural signals. For example, if the final decision is to \"increase the degree of analgesia and focus on relieving pain in the L5 segment\", then the interface will adjust the parameters of the implantable analgesic chip accordingly, release pulses of specific intensity and frequency at the corresponding position of L5 to suppress signal transduction, and drive the AI dispensing pump to accurately infuse the appropriate amount of painkiller drugs. The entire implementation process is coordinated by the ACPU's control module (which may correspond to part of the SCFU/CDU), and the various intervention methods work in synergy. After execution, the system continues to monitor pain indicator changes through sensors to move on to the next cycle.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above three-layer structure corresponds to the architecture of the dual-loop interaction under the DIKWP × DIKWP model: the patient has a set of DIKWP semantic processing processes (sensation-cognition-response in vivo), and the external AI also has a set of DIKWP cognitive cycles (perceiving the patient→ knowledge reasoning→ decision-making purpose). When the two sets of cognitive cycles interact with each other, a closed-loop system of dual cycles is formed. Among them, the patient side is similar to the first cycle (object system), and the AI side is the second cycle (metacognitive system), and the two are constantly exchanging information and adjusting strategies through semantic interfaces. This architecture allows AI to self-monitor, self-reflect, and self-regulate the patient's condition, similar to the ability to have initial self-awareness, which is suitable for pain management. Because the analgesic process needs to constantly adjust the plan according to the effect, it is equivalent to the AI reflecting on the results of its own intervention behavior (for example, if it finds that a plan is not effective, it will adjust itself to avoid using ineffective solutions all the time).</p>\n<p>Through the three-layer closed-loop of \"somatic semantic self-perception, external semantic interpretation, and interactive consensus\", we realize the semantic feedback control of active analgesia: the pain generation → is detected as an abnormal deviation by semantics→ AI understands the semantics and proposes countermeasures→ interacts with people, confirms with people→, implements interventions, reduces pain, → feedback rebalance. Throughout the process, each step is driven at the semantic level, rather than simply signaling. For example, instead of mechanically venting stimulation or administering drugs, AI understands \"what kind of pain the patient is having, why it hurts, and what pain-relieving effect is needed\", and then purposefully regulates the relevant neural pathways and drug doses. This kind of semantic-driven regulation is more intelligent and personalized than traditional methods, which reflects the advantages of \"intelligent self-knowledge\" in active medicine. In addition, the system also considers the combination of energy field and information field when intervening: on the one hand, it acts on the body through physical energy means such as electrical stimulation and drugs (energy field regulation), and on the other hand, it ensures that these physical effects meet the requirements of the information layer and the purpose layer (coupling control of the information field to the energy field) through semantic operation. The research of Yucong Duan's team in other fields has shown that the internal cognitive state of AI can be effectively correlated with the external energy/information environment using DIKWP semantic graph and coupling tensor technology. Here, we apply it to the biomedical field to establish the coupling of semantics and neural signals, so that the intervention of machines in pain has both physical effects and semantic guidance, so as to achieve more refined, effective, safe and controllable therapeutic effects.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Project-Objectives\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Project-Objectives\" title=\"Project Objectives\"></a><strong>Project Objectives</strong></h1><p>Based on the above-mentioned theoretical framework and mechanism design, the project formulates the following overall goals and specific objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The overall goal is to elucidate the semantic mechanism of somatic receptive diseases (pain, itching, etc.), develop a set of active analgesic/antipruritic closed-loop system based on artificial consciousness semantic engine, integrate domestic analgesic chips, AI dispensing and semantic neural interface technologies, realize intelligent perception, semantic understanding and precise intervention of pain/itching, and provide a new generation of efficient, safe and personalized analgesic solutions for clinical practice.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Objective 1 (Mechanism Analysis): To establish a semantic model of pain/itch based on the DIKWP model, and to reveal the mechanism of pain and itch in the deviation between the information layer and the purpose layer; To study the key neural circuits of pain sensing and cognition, and the correspondence between them and the semantic level, and to form a full-chain cognitive map of pain/itching from physiology to semantics.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Target 2 (Models and Algorithms): Design and implement an application architecture for **the Artificial Consciousness Processing Unit (**ACPU) in the field of pain intervention.

The main task breakdowns are listed below in logical order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Semantic analysis of pain/pruritus mechanisms</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Task 1.1: Physiological signal acquisition and feature extraction. Multimodal pain/pruritus related data were collected, including neuroelectrical activity (e.g., peripheral nerve discharge, EEG/brain function imaging), autonomic response (heart rate, blood pressure, electrodermal imaging, etc.), biochemical markers (inflammatory mediators, stress hormones), and patient subjective reports. Establish standardized data sets. A signal processing algorithm was developed to extract key features from the raw data that can characterize the degree and nature of pain, such as spectral components, discharge frequency patterns, etc., corresponding to the data layer and information layer of the DIKWP model.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Task 1.2: Pain/Itch Semantic Model Building. Based on the data of task 1.1 and combined with medical knowledge and literature, the semantic elements of pain/pruritus were refined, including the sensory dimension (intensity, location, nature), emotional dimension (degree of unhappiness, emotional response), and cognitive dimension (controllability, expected harm). These elements are mapped to the semantic nodes of each layer of DIKWP to form a formal model. For example,</strong> <strong>ontology</strong> <strong>or ontology can be used to describe the correlation between the definition of \"burning pain due to nerve injury\" at the knowledge level and the purpose layer of \"avoiding re-injury of the limb\". Output pain/pruritus semantic ontology and cognitive graphs</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Task 1.3: Information-Purpose Deviation Mechanism Study. The model of task 1.2 was used to analyze the differences in the causes and deviation characteristics of different types of pain/pruritus. For example, neuralgia is an abnormal deviation caused by oversensitivity to information, and cancer pain is a conflict between the signal of continuous tissue damage and the desire to live. This paper introduces Professor Yucong Duan's consciousness bug theory to explore the relationship between pain perception and prediction error (bias) signals, and reveals how pain arouses conscious attention as a deviation signal. This task will generate new understanding of the mechanism of pain</strong>/pruritus and inform subsequent intervention strategies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <strong>Artificial conscious analgesia models and algorithms</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Task 2.1: ACPU architecture design is customized for analgesia. Referring to the ACPU white paper architecture and ACPU applications in other fields, the ACPU module division and data flow suitable for pain intervention are designed. Specifically, it includes: the design of the Subliminal Computing Unit (SCU) to determine which sensory inputs (neural signals, sensing data) the SCU acquires and what parallel algorithms are used to extract pain semantic features; Design of Conscious Decision Unit (CDU) – to determine which inference algorithms (e.g., knowledge graph-based reasoning, reinforcement learning decision-making) are built into the CDU for pain diagnosis and analgesic program planning; The design of the Semantic Fusion Unit (SCFU) – to determine how the SCU interacts with the CDU, especially in the case of acute and intense pain, the SCU can directly trigger a rapid reflex intervention, and in the general case, the CDU will make a co-ordinated decision, and the results of the two will be output through the SCFU fusion. Draw an architecture diagram to indicate the functions and interfaces of each module.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Task 2.2: Pain semantic understanding and diagnostic algorithms. A semantic parsing algorithm was developed to run on the ACPU, enabling the system to automatically identify the current pain/itch semantic state</strong>. Includes: feature-based pain estimation (mapping sensing features to pain intensity scores); Pain classification (distinguish between semantic categories such as neuropathic, inflammatory, ischemic pain, etc.); Inference of the cause of pain (inference of possible causes, such as \"nerve compression\" or \"tissue hypoxia\" in combination with the knowledge base). A combination of machine learning and knowledge reasoning is adopted: for example, a deep learning model is trained to classify pain, and then the model output is interpreted with knowledge graph rules to ensure interpretability. Outputs an instance of the DIKWP semantic graph of the current patient, including the association of symptoms-&gt; diagnosis.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Task 2.3: Semantic-driven analgesic decision algorithms. Based on the semantic state of the patient obtained in task 2.2, a decision-making algorithm was developed to generate an intervention plan</strong>. This algorithm takes the difference between the patient's DIKWP profile and the standard medical DIKWP profile as input, with the goal of minimizing the difference (i.e., eliminating pain deviations). Planning search or reinforcement learning methods can be used to search for the optimal path in the semantic space. The combination of multiple interventions (medications, electrical stimulation, psychological guidance, etc.) and their expected effects at the semantic level need to be considered. Purpose-level constraints (e.g., patients who want to be awake and do not want drugs with large side effects) are introduced to screen the protocol, so that the decision-making is in line with the patient's wishes and medical ethics. The final output includes: intervention type, dose/intensity, target of action, duration and other parameters (with semantic annotations, such as \"XX drug Y mg is administered, expected to reduce the inflammatory response and relieve pain score 2 points\").</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Task 2.4: Human-Computer Semantic Interaction and Learning. Design human-computer interfaces so that AI decisions can be understood and fed back by patients and doctors. This includes presenting decision-making options in natural language and visualization for patient confirmation, as well as receiving verbal or keystroke input from the patient (e.g., feedback on pain relief). At the same time, a learning mechanism is established</strong>: the model and decision-making strategy are adjusted according to the actual changes in pain after implementation (closed-loop learning). Reinforcement learning or Bayesian adaptive methods are used to update the internal parameters of the ACPU to make the system \"smarter\" the more it is used. Pay special attention to <strong>the correction of the purpose deviation problem: if there is a discrepancy between the AI decision and the patient's expectation many times, the cause should be analyzed and the purpose understanding module of the AI should be</strong> corrected. The goal is to continuously optimize value alignment to ensure that AI always serves the real needs of patients.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <strong>R&amp;D of key hardware and devices</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Task 3.1: Development of domestic implantable analgesic chips. Based on the existing research and development results of neurostimulator in China, an implantable microchip was designed to realize the dual functions of pain signal monitoring and electrical stimulation (similar to INS2 chip). The main modules of the chip include: a miniature neural signal harvester (multi-channel microelectrode that collects the discharge signal of the pain fibers of the spinal cord or peripheral nerves); Signal processing and communication unit (initial filtering, amplification, and wireless transmission of data to an external ACPU or reception of external commands); Low-frequency/high-frequency electrical stimulation generators (when receiving analgesic instructions, release specific parameters of electrical stimulation to the target nerve structure, such as blocking nerve conduction with high-frequency pulses); Power &amp; Packaging (Seamless Wireless Rechargeable Battery, Biocompatible Package). Focus on the miniaturization and safety of the chip: the target size is &lt; coin, which is convenient for implantation close to the spinal nerve; Ensure that the stimulation precision is adjustable (0-10V pulse, the intensity can be fine-tuned) and that the tissue is not damaged. The R&amp;D process includes simulation design, FPGA validation, tape-out manufacturing, and in vitro testing.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Task 3.2: AI intelligent dispensing system development. A computer-controlled analgesic drug dispensing device</strong> (intelligent infusion pump) was developed, which combined with AI algorithm to accurately control drug delivery. In terms of hardware, it includes a high-precision multi-channel syringe pump that can store a variety of analgesic-related drugs (such as opioids, local anesthetics, anti-inflammatory drugs, etc.); The sensing module monitors the infusion pressure and the remaining amount of the drug; The wireless communication interface accepts the ACPU command. In terms of software, we have developed a medication decision-making engine that adjusts the dose and infusion speed of each drug according to the AI decision-making plan, and responds to changes in the patient's status in real time (e.g., automatic bolus injection of analgesics based on sudden increases in pain). Introduce safety policies to prevent overdose (built-in dose cap, automatic discontinuation and alarm for abnormal conditions). The system is similar to the clinical PCA (Patient Controlled Analgesia Pump) but smarter: with the assistance of AI, it is able to objectively monitor pain and automatically adjust the dose. We will work with the Department of Clinical Anesthesiology to test the reliability and effectiveness of the AI dispensing system in a simulated ward environment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Task 3.3: Virtual Neuron Semantic Simulation Platform. Development of a software simulation platform for simulating pain generation and intervention mechanisms in a computer environment</strong>. The platform consists of two parts of the model: one is neural network simulation, which builds a multi-layer neuronal network model based on the known pain conduction pathway (peripheral-spinal cord-brain) to reproduce the transmission and amplification process of pain signals (such as simulating central sensitization involving C fibers and microglia); The second is semantic cognitive simulation, which builds a high-level agent based on the DIKWP model, corresponding to a virtual \"artificial patient\", with parameters such as pain threshold and emotion, and can produce \"subjective responses\" to input from neural networks. This virtual patient is embedded with the ACPU algorithm, allowing them to experience pain and be affected by the intervention just like a real person. Using this platform, we can verify the logic of our algorithm without turning on human/animal experiments: for example, by inputting a continuous pain stimulus, we can observe whether the ACPU can correctly diagnose and output analgesic instructions, and whether the discharge of the virtual neural network is reduced. You can also test the effect of different parameter settings to provide a basis for actual system parameter tuning. The platform visualizes neural activity and semantic state over time, providing researchers with visual feedback.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Task 3.4: Semantic-neural coupling interface. This is the bridge that connects \"brain semantic decision-making\" and \"peripheral neuromodulation\". In hardware, a brain-computer interface or signal converter is included to translate the high-level semantic instructions output by the ACPU into specific low-level control signals</strong> and distribute them to the executors in tasks 3.1 and 3.2. For example, when the ACPU decides that \"pain in the L5 area needs to be reduced at level 3\", the interface will decode it as: \"Send stimulation command to the implanted chip (channel x, frequency y, for z seconds) + command syringe pump to administer w mg\", and execute it synchronously. In turn, the interface aggregates the state of the actuator and the patient's physiological feedback, converting the underlying data into semantic information and sending it back to the ACPU (e.g., \"Stimulation completed, patient's heart rate drops, pain relief is possible\"). Technically, there is a need to develop reliable communication protocols (to ensure low-latency transmission between multimodal devices inside and outside the human body), standard semantic instruction formats (semantic tags that define various intervention actions), and exception handling mechanisms (e.g., response when intervention fails). This interface technology is also of general significance and can be generalized to other applications of semantic control biological systems.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <strong>System integration and validation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Task 4.1: Active analgesia system integration. Integrate all of the aforementioned components – ACPU algorithm platform, analgesic chip, dispensing system, semantic interface, etc. – into a unified working system. Set up a laboratory testbed, including an industrial computer/embedded board with ACPU software (or burn the ACPU algorithm on an FPGA/ASIC to simulate a dedicated chip), and work in tandem with the implantable analgesic chip and the intelligent infusion pump through wired/wireless connection. Ensure that the communication protocol of each module is consistent, the data format is matched, and the whole system is smooth from sensing input to intervention output. Optimize system latency so that the total delay from detecting escalated pain to performing the intervention is within seconds to ensure timeliness.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Task 4.2: Animal Experiment Validation. Under strict ethical approval, appropriate animal models (e.g., rat chronic sciatica model, monkey pruritus model, etc.) were selected for systematic testing. First, the safety of the implanted chip and the range of stimulation parameters were tested on anesthetized animals. The closed-loop analgesic effect was then validated on free-roaming pain model animals: for example, the control group used traditional constant stimulation or constant administration, and our experimental group used AI closed-loop adjustment to compare pain behavior scores, neuronal firing inhibition, and other indicators. It is expected to prove that the AI semantic system can more effectively reduce painful behaviors (such as shortening the time of licking the feet, increasing the amount of activity), and the dosage is more economical and the side effects are fewer. For the pruritus model, to assess the effect of AI intervention in reducing scratching behavior. Physiological data were collected to verify the accuracy of the system's identification of different types of pain and the rationality of decision-making. If problems are found, improve the algorithm or parameters in time.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Task 4.3: Preliminary clinical trial (exploratory) Under the premise of ensuring safety, it is planned to select a small number of patients with severe chronic pain (such as cancer pain and amputated neuralgia) for exploratory clinical experience. After obtaining the patient's informed consent, we install our system (implanted chip or patch, electrical stimulation device combined with drug delivery pump, ACPU decision module running on a portable device). The effect of systematic automatic analgesia over a period of time was observed, including changes in pain self-rating, changes in the amount of analgesic drugs, and improvement in daily function. It also focuses on collecting feedback from patients and physicians: for example, are the system recommendations reasonable? Is the human-computer interaction friendly? Further refinement of the system based on feedback. At this stage, we also evaluate the robustness of the system (failure rate over long periods of operation) and safety (e.g., preventing over-stimulation by mistake). This will lay the groundwork for the next step of large-scale clinical testing.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <strong>Outputs and translations of results</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Task 5.1: Collation and publication of theoretical results. Summarize the theoretical innovations of the project in the mechanism of pain/itching and artificial consciousness model, and write high-level academic papers and monographs. For example, a</strong> series of papers have been submitted to internationally renowned journals and conferences in the direction of pain semantic model, <strong>active medicine DIKWP framework</strong>, and <strong>artificial consciousness analgesia algorithm to enhance academic influence. At the same time, the key theories developed in the course of the research (such as the \"semantic deviation hypothesis of pain\") are considered for patent application for protection.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Task 5.2: Patent and Intellectual Property Layout: At least 10 domestic and foreign invention patents have been applied for around the core technology of this project, including but not limited to: the application method of DIKWP in pain management, the artificial consciousness analgesia decision-making system, the implantable semantic analgesia chip circuit, the communication protocol to realize the semantic-neural interface, the AI drug delivery control method, etc. Obtain access to PCT international applications for some patents in order to protect the global market. Build a complete IP portfolio to provide technical barriers for future industrialization. (Professor Yucong Duan's DIKWP technology system has 114 patents, and we will also learn from his experience to improve the patent layout).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Task 5.3: Standards and norm development. Combined with the results of the project, participate in the formulation of industry standards or guidelines for intelligent analgesic systems. For example, in conjunction with the Medical Device Standards Committee, it put forward recommendations such as safety specifications, data interface standards, and evaluation indicators for implantable AI analgesic devices. Promote the inclusion of the concept of \"active analgesia\" in the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for chronic pain, and improve clinical acceptance.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Task 5.4: Industrial Transformation and Cooperation. Actively cooperate with medical device companies and pharmaceutical companies to explore the path of project productization. It is planned to set up an entrepreneurial team or set up a joint laboratory with existing enterprises to accelerate the transformation of prototypes into products. Conduct market research to evaluate the capacity and segmentation needs of the chronic pain management market, and provide a basis for product positioning and functional improvement. Seek investment and government support to complete clinical trials, regulatory approvals, and more required for product registration. The goal is to</strong> launch a commercial intelligent analgesic system, including implanted chips and supporting AI equipment, within 3-5 years after the end of the project, and take the lead in pilot application in several pain diagnosis and treatment centers in China, and gradually promote it. In the long run, it can be expanded to a series of active medical products in the fields of itching, rehabilitation, and mental stress, forming a new industrial direction of \"artificial consciousness medicine\".</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above tasks will be carried out in parallel by the research group according to the plan, and dynamically adjusted according to the results at each stage. The tasks are closely related to each other, forming a complete chain from basic research to application implementation.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Technical-route-and-implementation-plan\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Technical-route-and-implementation-plan\" title=\"Technical route and implementation plan\"></a><strong>Technical route and implementation plan</strong></h1><p>In order to achieve the above research content and objectives, the project has developed a systematic technical route. The overall technical solution is shown in the figure (<em>a project technical roadmap can be attached here</em>): we take the DIKWP*DIKWP dual-cycle architecture as the framework, and closely integrate the three levels of biological signal processing, artificial intelligence semantic decision-making, and biofeedback execution, and gradually realize the closed-loop system in stages.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Overall architecture: The</strong> overall architecture of the project is divided into three layers, from bottom to top: <strong>data perception layer</strong>, <strong>semantic decision-making layer and execution feedback layer</strong>。 The data perception layer consists of various biosensors and implanted chips, which collect multimodal information of the patient's body and perform preliminary processing (corresponding to the D/I layer and self-sensing layer of the DIKWP model). The semantic decision-making layer is composed of the Artificial Consciousness Engine (ACPU), which combines with the external knowledge base to carry out high-level semantic understanding and intervention decision-making on the perceptual data (corresponding to the K/W/P layer and the external interpretation layer). The executive feedback layer includes effectors such as electrical stimulators and smart drug pumps, which intervene on patients under semantic instructions and feed back the results through sensors (corresponding to the interactive consensus layer). Layer 3 is connected by high-speed communication and a unified data/semantic interface to form a closed loop.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Key technical path:</strong> The signals obtained by the data perception layer are first extracted from the pain characteristics (such as signal amplitude and frequency, which are converted into indicators of pain intensity and type) through parallel calculation of the SCU module. These primary semantic features are passed to the CDU module, which invokes the knowledge graph for inference (such as the aforementioned diagnosis and scenario planning algorithms). After the CDU derives a decision (including intervention semantics, such as pain reduction X%, use of Y means), it is handed over to the executive layer for concretization through the SCFU module. Semantic-neural <strong>interface parsing decisions at the execution layer: parameterization of the implanted chip on the one hand (e.g., adjusting the stimulus intensity frequency) and control of the drug delivery pump on the other hand (e.g., adjusting the dose), and possibly signaling the patient (e.g., APP notification). During the execution process, the data perception layer continuously monitors the effect and feeds back new data to the SCU</strong> to form a closed loop. Throughout the pathway, we use hierarchical control: minor pain may be mainly adapted by the SCU (e.g., automatically fine-tuning the stimulation intensity without reporting to the CDU); Severe or complex pain is escalated to the global management of the CDU, which determines the cross-modal approach as a whole. This layered control ensures that timeliness is as important as optimizing the overall effect.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Phased advancement: The</strong> technical route is implemented according to the strategy of simulation first and then physical object, local first and then integration. In the initial stage, the algorithm was verified by a virtual simulation platform, and the closed-loop was run in a pure software environment (Phase 1). In the medium term, the hardware unit is developed and gradually connected to the closed loop: the analgesic chip and the dispensing pump are first connected separately to test their respective controlled effects, and then connected in parallel to form a complete system test (Phase 2). Later validation in a real biological environment: fine-tuning animal experiments and finally applying to human experiments (Phase 3). Each stage is connected and promoted, and the hardware parameters are designed on the basis of simulation results, and the clinical protocol is optimized on the basis of animal results to reduce the risk of R&amp;D.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Safety &amp; Redundancy Design:</strong> System safety is explicitly considered in the route. All automatic decision-making has a human-computer interaction confirmation mechanism, and a one-key emergency stop function prevents malfunction. Dual-logic verification: Each key decision of the AI is checked by independent rules (such as whether the drug dose is exceeded), and only when it is passed, it is executed to avoid black-box errors. Encryption and handshake mechanisms are used in communication to prevent external interference. The implanted chip is designed with fail-safe mode: once the AI command is lost, it can be reduced to the regular SCS mode to maintain the basic analgesia. There is also redundancy in the data layer and decision-making layer: multi-mode acquisition and verification of important physiological signals, and multiple model voting of decision-making algorithms to ensure reliability.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Project path:</strong> In the implementation of the project, the parallel team collaboration mode will be adopted. The biomedical team is responsible for sensors, chips, and animal testing; The AI team is responsible for ACPU software and algorithm development; The system integration team is responsible for interfaces, communications, embedded implementations, and more. Through multidisciplinary cooperation, the system is gradually built and improved according to a unified roadmap. In terms of project management, milestone control is adopted, and the review is carried out at the end of each stage, and the quality is checked before moving to the next stage to ensure that the effectiveness and safety of the final system meet medical requirements.</p>\n<p>In summary, the technical roadmap strives to modularize and hierarchical complex cross-domain problems to reduce the difficulty and ensure the implementation of the final results. From semantic theory innovation to engineering implementation, there is a clear route guarantee for each step. This route also embodies the guiding ideology of comprehensive theory + engineering framework + industry landing: it not only gives full play to the advantages of high-level semantic intelligence, but also pays attention to the feasibility of the underlying hardware, and finally produces an applicable system instead of staying in theory. Next, we detail the project's phase plan and milestones.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Phase-goals-and-timelines\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Phase-goals-and-timelines\" title=\"Phase goals and timelines\"></a><strong>Phase goals and timelines</strong></h1><p>The project is planned to be implemented in three phases over a five-year period, each with clear milestones and target outcomes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Year 1-2 (Principle Model and Key Technology Verification):</strong><br/><em>Milestone 1:</em> Completion of the construction of the pain/itch semantic model and the initial implementation of the artificial consciousness analgesia algorithm. Within the first 18 months, complete most of the work on Tasks 1 and 2. Specific objectives include: publishing at least one theoretical paper to elaborate on the semantic model of DIKWP pain and the information-purpose deviation mechanism; Build a basic virtual simulation platform, run through the closed-loop logic of the ACPU algorithm, and verify the effectiveness of the algorithm in the software environment (for example, the pain reduction index in the simulation meets the expectations); Apply for 2-3 basic invention patents (such as pain semantic analysis methods, artificial consciousness decision-making methods). Evaluation indicators: The accuracy rate of the pain recognition algorithm reaches more than 80%, and the consistency rate between the scheme given by semantic decision-making and the expert plan &gt; 70%. The stage risk lies in model complexity control and algorithm convergence, which needs to be solved by constantly testing and adjusting parameters.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Phase 2 (Year 3-4, System Development and Integration Testing):</strong><br/><em>Milestone 2:</em> Completion of small-scale verification of core hardware development and system integration. At 36 months, the goals include: developing a prototype of an implantable analgesic chip and verifying stimulation accuracy (error &lt;5%) and monitoring sensitivity through bench testing; Developed a prototype of AI dispensing and tested the dose control error of &lt;10% in a simulated patient environment; A closed-loop system was initially integrated to verify that the analgesic effect was at least 30% higher than that of the control in small animals (such as rat pain models). He has published 1-2 engineering application papers and applied for more than 5 patents (chips, interfaces, and systems). By the end of Year 4, <em>Milestone 3</em>: Systematic trials on large animals (e.g., pigs or monkeys) were completed to prove that implanted devices are safe and feasible, and that AI decisions are effective in 90% of scenarios. Evaluation index: The real-time performance of the system met the requirements (the total delay of perception-decision-execution&lt;1 second), and the animal behavioral pain score was significantly improved (P&lt;0.05). The key difficulties in the stage are the multi-module collaboration and the uncertainty of animal testing, which require repeated debugging.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Year 5:</strong><br/><em>Milestone 4:</em> Completion of initial clinical trials and project closure. Within the fifth year, with regulatory clearance, the system was trialed for a small number of volunteer patients (e.g., 2-3 patients with severe chronic pain). Objective: The accuracy of the verification system in identifying human pain was &gt;85%, and the subjective report of analgesic effect was improved compared with the previous protocol. No serious adverse events occurred. Collect clinical data to optimize human-computer interaction design. At the end of the project, submit the project summary report and the next clinical trial application materials. Complete all expected paper patent indicators, and form technical specifications and business plans that can be promoted. Evaluation indicators: the patient's pain VAS score decreased by &gt;=50%, and the quality of life score was improved; Physician and patient satisfaction is high. The difficulties in the stage are individual clinical differences and safety supervision, which need to be closely coordinated with hospitals and regulatory authorities.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Convergence between phases: The first phase provides algorithms and models for the second phase to materialize, and the results of the second phase lay the foundation for the third phase of clinical trials. We set up regular checkpoints, such as internal review progress every six months, and timely find lags or problems for resource adjustment. Leave a buffer on the timeline to deal with unforeseen challenges to ensure that key milestones are completed on time. The whole plan strives to make steady progress and accelerate the R&amp;D process while ensuring safety and reliability, so that innovation can benefit patients as soon as possible.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Expected-outcomes-and-conversion-paths\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Expected-outcomes-and-conversion-paths\" title=\"Expected outcomes and conversion paths\"></a><strong>Expected outcomes and conversion paths</strong></h1><p>The successful completion of this project will bring significant scientific research results and application value.

According to statistics, in 2018, chronic diseases accounted for 88.5% of deaths in China, of which cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes accounted for 47.1%, 24.1%, 8.8% and 2.5% of the total deaths, respectively. With the aging population and lifestyle changes, the burden of these chronic diseases continues to increase, and the morbidity and mortality rates are on the rise. Traditional medical research mostly focuses on the local organs and physiological mechanisms of diseases, and does not pay enough attention to the overall interaction between the central nervous system (brain) and peripheral organs (bodies). As a result, we lack a global understanding of the occurrence and development of chronic diseases, and many **brain-body interaction mechanisms have not been deeply revealed. In fact, a large number of studies have shown that psychological, neurological, endocrine, immune and other multi-system factors jointly affect the course of chronic diseases. For example, the brain communicates bidirectionally with organs throughout the body through neural pathways, endocrine hormones, and immune mediators: the gut forms a typical \"**brain-gut axis\" with the center, which involves neurological, endocrine, and immune signal reciprocation; Similarly, the \"brain-lung axis\" has been proposed to explain the multiplex communication between the brain and the lungs, and has been found to be closely related to a variety of lung and central disease states. There is also a significant two-way correlation between the cardiovascular system and the central nervous system – \"brain health and heart health are closely related and mutually influential\". These evidences suggest that chronic diseases are not simply localized, but rather systemic, <strong>physiological-psychological, and intertwined network disorders</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Emerging paradigm requirements for brain-body interaction:</strong> In the process of developing chronic diseases, the regulatory disorders of peripheral organs and the adverse effects of peripheral pathological changes on brain function often form a vicious circle. For example, in metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, the regulatory mechanism of energy balance in brain regions such as the hypothalamus is impaired, resulting in appetite and metabolic disorders; At the same time, peripheral abnormalities such as hyperglycemia and inflammation in turn impair central cognitive function, leading to memory loss or mood disorders. The study highlights that the role of the nervous system in maintaining energy homeostasis goes far beyond the traditional understanding of endocrine regulation, including circadian rhythms, higher brain regions, and psychosocial factors that affect metabolic homeostasis. Another example is chronic psychological stress through the overactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in long-term elevations of cortisol and catecholamines, <strong>inhibiting the body's immune surveillance function</strong>, thereby promoting tumorigenesis and development. Correspondingly, inflammatory factors released by the tumor microenvironment can affect the brain through the blood-brain barrier or vagus nerve, causing \"disease behaviors\" such as decreased appetite, fatigue, and depression. Studies have shown that chronic inflammation-induced \"sickness behavior\" <strong>has a protective effect in the acute phase, but if it persists for a long time, it will change to a state of maladaptation, aggravate symptoms such as depression and cognitive impairment, and further worsen the chronic disease process. Similarly, in chronic respiratory diseases such as COPD, chronic hypoxia and inflammation in the lungs can trigger central neuroinflammation and cognitive decline; Anxiety can aggravate asthma or chest tightness, creating a vicious cycle of mind and body. It can be seen that the imbalance of central-peripheral two-way regulation is an important reason for the prolongation and repeated aggravation of many chronic diseases. However, there is a</strong> lack of systematic theoretical models to characterize and explain these cognitive coupling patterns of brain-body interaction imbalance, and it is difficult to propose effective comprehensive intervention strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>New ideas provided by the DIKWP model:</strong> In response to the above challenges, this project uses the DIKWP model originally proposed by Professor Yucong Duan as the core theoretical support to explore a new paradigm of brain-body interaction. The DIKWP model was originally used as a cognitive framework for artificial intelligence, which was extended from the classic \"Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom\" system. The model introduces \"Purpose\" at the top level to form <strong>a cognitive chain of five levels: Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom (Wisdom), and Purpose (Purpose). This expansion emphasizes the central role of decision-making purpose in the process of intelligent cognition</strong>, and combines the subjective purpose of the subject with objective information processing, which is regarded as a major theoretical innovation in the field of artificial intelligence. The five-layer structure is abstracted from the bottom to the top: from the perception and processing of raw data, it is refined into information, integrated into knowledge, and then rises to Wisdom decision-making, and finally the top-level purpose guides and constrains the direction of action. Unlike the traditional linear hierarchical model, DIKWP uses a mesh structure to support two-way feedback and iterative updates between levels. In other words, the high-level decision-making goals of the Purpose layer can in turn affect the data collection and information interpretation process of the lower layers, and the knowledge and wisdom of each layer can also be continuously revised in the loop, so that the system has the ability to self-update and adapt. This system provides a transparent and decomposable framework for understanding complex cognitive processes, makes the internal processing process explicit and modular, and facilitates layer-by-layer analysis and diagnosis, thereby improving the interpretability and controllability of the overall system.</p>\n<p>We foresee that the introduction of the DIKWP model into the study of brain-body interaction can unify the modeling of physiological signals and cognitive processes: the state and interaction between the brain and the periphery can be described at five levels: data, information, knowledge, wisdom, and purpose. For example, peripheral signs can be regarded as \"data\", which can be interpreted and interpreted by the central nervous system as \"information\", which is further integrated by the brain into \"knowledge\" of diseases and \"wisdom\" of coping strategies, and finally the patient forms the \"purpose\" of recovery or behavior adjustment. In turn, the patient's subjective purpose and emotions influence their behavioral decisions (Wisdom layer) and physiological responses (acting on the periphery through the endocrine neural pathway). The bidirectional network interaction structure of DIKWP fits into this cyclical brain-body information flow, which can be used as a theoretical tool to describe cognitive-physiological <strong>coupling.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Emerging Combination of Artificial Consciousness Theory and Digital Intervention: The</strong> DIKWP model is essentially an Artificial Consciousness framework. Its outstanding feature is that the autonomous <strong>purpose</strong> is incorporated into the computational model, so that the agent has the ability to regulate goal-driven behavior similar to consciousness. This provides the possibility for the introduction of \"artificial consciousness\" intervention in the field of chronic diseases: by building an artificial intelligence system with the ability to simulate consciousness, it can perceive the physical and mental state of patients and guide and regulate them. In recent years, the application of AI in healthcare has been increasing, but most of them are still limited to data analysis and decision-making. This project will be further expanded to develop an \"artificial awareness-driven digital intervention system\" with the help of the DIKWP artificial awareness model, which attempts to allow AI to not only analyze data, but also simulate the human cognitive purpose process and interact with patients. <strong>It provides a new technical approach for chronic disease management from the three levels of psychology, physiology and behavior. For example, the system can act like a \"digital coach\" or an \"artificial consciousness companion\" to monitor the patient's physiological and emotional indicators in real time (data</strong>/information layer), understand the patient's behavior patterns and health knowledge (knowledge layer), evaluate their decision-making ability and problems in their lifestyle habits (the Wisdom layer), and guide the patient to change bad behaviors by stimulating the patient's willingness and motivation to recover (the Purpose layer). This approach is expected to break through the traditional one-way digital health approach and truly realize personalized and proactive intervention for patients with chronic diseases. Previous studies have shown that AI-integrated digital health interventions can significantly improve the management of chronic diseases, such as improving blood sugar control and weight loss in diabetic patients, and the higher the patient engagement, the more significant the effect. This suggests that the introduction of smarter, more \"aware\" interactive systems may further improve patient compliance and disease management outcomes.</p>\n<p><strong>Project significance:</strong> This project closely follows the guidelines of the National Key R&amp;D Program \"Research on the Regulation Mechanism of Brain-Body Interaction in Common Major Chronic Diseases and Novel Intervention Strategies\", and has important theoretical innovation value and practical significance.</p>\n<p>(1) Theoretically, this study will establish a <strong>new paradigm of cognitive model of brain-body interaction</strong>. Through the construction of the DIKWP*DIKWP bidirectional interaction model, we can systematically characterize the information coupling and regulation law of the central and peripheral areas in the process of chronic diseases, and enrich the scientific understanding of the mechanism of mind-body unity in chronic diseases. This will expand the traditional biomedical model, introduce cognitive science and artificial intelligence perspectives, and promote the <strong>development of psychophysiological integrated medicine.</strong></p>\n<p>(2) In terms of application, this study explores artificial consciousness-driven intervention strategies, and is expected to propose new digital therapeutics and intelligent rehabilitation methods. By intervening in the behavior and physiology of patients by simulating their state of consciousness, we hope to enhance patients' self-management ability and treatment adherence, thereby improving the prognosis of chronic diseases. In particular, in view of the current pain points of patients' lack of motivation and poor long-term compliance in the management of chronic diseases, the intervention of strengthening the \"purpose layer\" will provide a new solution.</p>\n<p>(3) This project is an interdisciplinary study, integrating artificial intelligence, neuroscience, endocrine immunity, biomedical engineering and other fields, in response to the requirements of the \"Healthy China 2030\" plan for innovative chronic disease prevention and control technologies. The implementation of the project will help enhance China's independent innovation capabilities in the field of smart medicine and digital health, and produce high-level scientific research results and transformable technical products. In short, this project is based on the national economy and people's livelihood problem of major chronic diseases, and proposes a new idea of brain-body interaction and artificial consciousness integration, which is expected to make breakthroughs in disease mechanism research and intervention technology, with significant scientific value and social benefits.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Overall-objectives-and-technical-roadmaps\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Overall-objectives-and-technical-roadmaps\" title=\"Overall objectives and technical roadmaps\"></a><strong>Overall objectives and technical roadmaps</strong></h1><p><strong>Overall Objective:</strong> This project aims to elucidate the <strong>regulatory mechanisms of brain-body interactions in common major chronic diseases</strong> to construct a cognitive representation framework with the DIKWP*DIKWP interaction model as the core, and reveal the coupling mode of cognitive levels such as information, knowledge, wisdom and purpose in the disease process. On this basis, the theory of artificial consciousness was introduced, and a three-dimensional regulatory pathway model of \"cognition-metabolism-immunity\" was established to analyze the mechanism of abnormal higher-order neurological functions (such as self-perception, purpose and motivation) on the chronicity of chronic disease behavior. Finally, a set of artificial consciousness-driven digital intervention system was developed, including cognitive status monitoring, purpose activation feedback, digital behavior reconstruction and other modules, and its effectiveness in individualized regulation and chronic disease rehabilitation was verified. Specifically, the following objectives will be achieved through this project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>**Objective 1: To establish a two-way cognitive model of brain-body interaction (DIKWP). **The central nervous system and peripheral organs were abstracted into the five-layer structural units of DIKWP, and the data flow, information exchange, knowledge coupling, Wisdom decision-making and purpose feedback mechanisms between the two were explained. Through this model, the interaction processes at different levels, such as neuro-endocrine-immunity, are described in a unified manner, and a new paradigm model of brain-body interaction is proposed.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>**Objective 2: To elucidate the mechanism of central-peripheral regulatory disorders in chronic diseases. **For four typical chronic diseases, namely metabolic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, tumors, and chronic respiratory diseases, this paper studies the pattern of disorders in the regulation of peripheral physiology of the brain in disease states, as well as the reverse regulation of peripheral pathological changes on central cognitive and emotional functions. To reveal the common and differential mechanisms of brain-body interaction imbalance in different diseases, and to provide a basis for intervention.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>**Objective 3: To uncover the relationship between Purpose layer disorder and worsening of chronic disease behavior. **Based on the theory of artificial consciousness, a three-dimensional interaction of \"cognition-metabolism-immunity\" regulatory pathway model is proposed to simulate the higher-order functional abnormalities such as weakened self-perception, impaired purpose, and degenerative motivation in patients with chronic diseases. To elucidate <strong>the mechanisms by which the disorder at the purpose level of patients leads to persistent poor lifestyle behaviors (e.g., poor adherence, lazy exercise, etc.), thereby contributing to the chronicity of the disease and difficulty in recovery.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>**Goal 4: Develop artificial awareness-driven digital intervention systems. **Design and implement an intelligent intervention platform integrating artificial consciousness, including: monitoring and evaluation module of central cognitive state and peripheral physiological indicators, patient purpose activation and feedback guidance module, and digital behavior reconstruction module. Through clinical trials or user studies, the effect of the system on improving patient initiative and improving the management effect of chronic diseases is verified, and a new path of individualized regulation and rehabilitation is explored.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to achieve the above goals, the project proposes the following technical routes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Theoretical modeling stage (brain-body interaction model construction):</strong> First, the theoretical analysis and model construction of brain-body interaction are carried out. Based on a large number of literature and experimental data, the two-way action pathways of central nervous system and peripheral organs in chronic diseases (such as neuro-immune feedback circuit, endocrine compensation mechanism, etc.) were sorted out. Based on the DIKWP model, a dual-agent interaction architecture is introduced: a DIKWP*DIKWP interaction model composed of two five-layer DIKWP units is constructed, which represents the two subsystems of \"brain\" and \"body\" respectively. Clarify the specific meaning of each layer (data, information, knowledge, wisdom, purpose) in the brain and body and how it interacts across systems. A preliminary conceptual model and graphical framework of brain-body interaction were formed.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Mechanism Research Stage (Applied Research on Chronic Diseases):</strong> Focusing on four types of chronic diseases, the dysfunctional mechanism of brain-body interaction is studied in depth. The method of combining clinical research and animal experiments was used to collect central nervous system indicators (EEG, functional MRI, cognitive function test) and peripheral physiological indicators (hormone levels, immune factors, metabolic parameters, etc.) in patients with metabolic diseases (such as type 2 diabetes, obesity), cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, coronary heart disease), tumors (such as cancer with depression), COPD/asthma, etc., and analyze the signal correlation changes between the central and peripheral areas. These changes are characterized and explained by the DIKWP interaction model, and the characteristic patterns of coupling dysregulation of the information layer, knowledge layer, wisdom layer and purpose layer in each disease are refined. To summarize the common mechanisms of brain-body regulatory disorders, such as: how the imbalance of the HPA axis caused by chronic stress produces similar immunosuppressive effects in different diseases; The central \"disease behavior\" caused by peripheral inflammation is prevalent in a variety of chronic diseases. At the same time, it is necessary to identify points of difference, such as metabolic disease more prominent hypothalamic-vagus nerve pathway disorder, cardiovascular disease more involved autonomic cardiac regulation disorder, etc. Produce mechanistic models and scientific data support for brain-body interaction disorders.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Artificial consciousness fusion stage (Purpose layer disorder and intervention target): Incorporate</strong> the theory of artificial consciousness into the study of the mechanism of chronic diseases. Taking the top-level \"Purpose\" of the DIKWP model as the starting point, the role of patients' subjective state of consciousness in the process of chronic diseases was discussed. Constructing <strong>a cognitive-metabolic-immune three-dimensional regulatory model</strong>: A cognitive-psychological dimension is added to the brain-body interaction model to simulate the higher brain functions (including self-awareness, emotion, and willpower) of patients. Through literature research and clinical psychological evaluation data, the common psychological changes (such as chronic disease depression, burnout, and depression) of patients with chronic diseases were analyzed. Key simulations: decreased self-perception (sensitivity to one's own symptoms and physical state), <strong>impaired purpose function</strong> (willingness and goal to perform healthy behaviors), <strong>motivational system</strong>(reward-driven positivity) degradation. The DIKWP framework is used to characterize how these changes affect cognitive processes—for example, the weakened function of the Purpose layer will make it difficult for the Wisdom decision-makers to make health-friendly choices, and patients will know that they need to exercise but lack motivation to act, which will eventually lead to the solidification of unhealthy lifestyles and the chronicity of disease behavior patterns. Combining psychological questionnaires and behavioral data, the <strong>correlation between Purpose disorder and poor disease management was validated, revealing the causal circuits of both (e.g., depression leading to decreased adherence, poor adherence and aggravating the disease, thereby further deepening depression). On this basis, the hypothesis of the intervention target is proposed: that is, to</strong> break the vicious circle of chronic diseases by enhancing the function of the patient's Purpose layer (enhancing their initiative and sense of purpose). This stage will provide the theoretical basis and design direction of the digital intervention program.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>System development stage (artificial consciousness-driven intervention system development):</strong> Based on the above research results, the intervention system design and implementation will be entered. Firstly, the overall architecture of digital intervention is determined: the interaction system between the agent (artificial consciousness agent) and the patient is constructed with the DIKWP artificial consciousness model as the core. The system consists of the following sub-modules:<br/>After the development of the system, it will be tested and optimized on a small scale. Patients with target chronic diseases were invited to participate in a pilot study to observe the effects of the system on their physiological indicators, psychological scales, and behavior patterns. Improve the human-computer interaction design and algorithm performance of the system based on user feedback to ensure safe and effective intervention.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Cognitive layer status monitoring module:</strong> Develop multimodal data collection and analysis tools to monitor patients' physiological parameters (such as blood glucose, blood pressure, exercise level) and subjective feedback (such as pain scores, mood diaries) in real time, and map them to the data layer and information layer representation of the DIKWP model. IoT sensors and wearable devices are used to obtain peripheral data, combined with mobile phone applications to obtain patient self-reports, so as to achieve continuous perception of patients' physical and mental states. has shown that mobile applications with continuous monitoring and personalized feedback can significantly improve metabolic markers, and this module will draw on similar techniques.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Purpose Activation and Feedback Module:</strong> Based on the research results of the above-mentioned Purpose layer mechanism, an artificial intelligence algorithm is designed to evaluate the patient's current Purpose intensity and direction (such as the willingness to follow the doctor's prescription and the degree of motivation to exercise). Conversational AI (similar to ChatGPT and other large models, embedded in the DIKWP architecture to make it have a purpose representation) is used to interact with patients and provide customized psychological support and motivational incentives. For example, when a patient is detected to be depressed, the system guides the patient to reset his or her health goals through communication, providing positive feedback and reinforcing his intrinsic motivation. This module emphasizes human-computer empathetic interaction, so that patients feel understood and supported, so as to gradually rebuild positive purpose.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Digital Behavior Reconstruction Module:</strong> Translates the goal into a specific behavioral intervention plan, implements it digitally and tracks the effect. For example, for diabetic patients, the system formulates a daily diet and exercise plan (Wisdom layer decision-making) according to its Purpose-level goals (such as blood sugar control and weight loss), and supervises the implementation through the App (behavioral data is fed back to the information layer and re-enters the cycle). For patients with depressive tendencies, the module provides digital content such as mindfulness training and virtual reality relaxation therapy to help them improve their emotional and volitional states. All intervention behaviors will be recorded as data and entered into the cognitive monitoring module for closed-loop evaluation. Through continuous iteration (the two-way feedback mechanism of the DIKWP model), the intervention strategy is dynamically adjusted to adapt to the changes in the patient's state, so as to achieve individualized and precise intervention.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <strong>Validation evaluation phase (effect evaluation and objective assessment):</strong> At the end of the project, the effectiveness of the intervention system is evaluated through rigorous comparative trials. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted with typical diseases, such as a 6-month digital intervention trial in patients with type 2 diabetes, in which the control group received routine management and the experimental group used the artificial awareness intervention system developed in this project. Clinical indicators (such as glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure), patient compliance scores, quality of life scales, and cognitive function tests were measured before and after the trial. It is expected that the experimental group will be superior to the control group in terms of metabolic control and psychological state, thus verifying the clinical value of the system. At the same time, combined with the subjective evaluation of doctors and patients, the human-computer interaction experience and applicability of the system were comprehensively investigated. Collect multi-dimensional data to provide a quantitative basis for the achievement of project goals. Finally, the results of the project were summarized and refined, and a new theoretical model of the brain-body interaction mechanism of chronic diseases and a new technology and method of artificial consciousness intervention were formed.</p>\n<p>The above technical route covers the complete chain of basic theory construction→ mechanism research→ model integration→ system development→ effect verification, and each stage is organically connected and gradually deepened. According to the progress of the research, the project will continue to iterate between the model and the system: the new findings of the mechanism research will feed back to improve the DIKWP model, and the model improvement will guide the optimization of the intervention algorithm to ensure that the theory and application complement each other. This route fully reflects the characteristics of interdisciplinary research, which will realize the deep integration of medicine and artificial intelligence technology and ensure the smooth achievement of the project goals.</p>\n<p><em>(The figure below shows the schematic of the research content and technical route of this project, covering the construction of brain-body interaction model, the analysis of chronic disease mechanism, and the development of artificial consciousness intervention system.)

A new paradigm of brain-body interaction and the construction of the DIKWP*DIKWP model\"></a><strong>1. A new paradigm of brain-body interaction and the construction of the DIKWP*DIKWP model</strong></h2><p><strong>Overview:</strong> This part focuses on establishing a new theoretical paradigm of brain-body interaction in chronic diseases, and characterizes the bidirectional regulatory mechanism between the central and peripheral areas in the form of a DIKWP*DIKWP model. Main Studies:</p>\n<p>(1) how to map the interaction process between the central nervous system and peripheral organs into the five-layer architecture of the DIKWP model;</p>\n<p>(2) the cognitive coupling patterns of information, knowledge, wisdom, and purpose between brain and body and their changes in disease states.</p>\n<p><strong>Specific research contents:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>1.1 Design of DIKWP dual-subject interaction model:</strong> The \"brain\" and \"body\" are regarded as two information processing subjects, which have five layers of data, information, knowledge, wisdom and purpose. The main pathways of brain-body communication were summarized through literature analysis, such as neural network signals corresponding to fast data exchange, hormones and cytokines corresponding to slow information transmission. How the medical knowledge stored in the brain (disease cognition, treatment experience) and the pathological knowledge at the body level (immune memory, metabolic adaptation) interact with each other. On this basis, the topological structure of the brain-body DIKWP interaction model is designed: the connection relationship and interaction rules between the two subjects of each layer are defined. For example, the <strong>data layer</strong>: peripheral sensory signals are transmitted to the brain, and cranial nerve impulses are exported to the organs; <strong>Information layer</strong>: the center interprets somatic signals (e.g., pain, hunger sensation), and the periphery receives central instructions and translates them into physiological responses (e.g., rapid heartbeat during stress); <strong>Knowledge</strong>: The brain's perception of the current state (e.g., \"elevated blood pressure may mean pain\") interacts with the body's intrinsic homeostatic settings (e.g., the mechanism by which the renin-angiotensin system maintains blood pressure); <strong>Wisdom layer</strong>: the center synthesizes multiple information to make regulatory decisions (such as initiating sympathetic responses), and peripheral multi-organ coordination reaches a new homeostasis; <strong>Purpose layer</strong>: The brain produces subjective purposes (e.g., awareness of pain and seeking pain relief) that influence lower-level decision-making, and local \"purpose\" of the body can be seen as an expression of intrinsic needs (e.g., signals to increase ventilation when tissues are deprived of oxygen) and ascend to affect brain perception. Through the two-way connection between these \"five pairs of levels\", a networked brain-body interaction model map is formed. Then, the mathematical or logical description framework of the model is formulated, such as using ontology + semantic network to define the concepts and relationships of each layer, or establishing a coupled equation system based on system science. Output: Brain-body DIKWP interaction model shows the purpose and formal description.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>1.2 Analysis of brain-body cognitive coupling mode:</strong> The established model was used to analyze the changes in the coupling relationship between the brain-body cognitive layers in the health homeostasis and disease states. For example, at the Purpose level, the brain's goal (maintaining health) guides the body's physiological adjustment through autonomic and endocrine pathways, and the body's instinctive needs (hunger, thirst, fatigue signals) are accurately sensed and met by the brain at the right time, forming a closed-loop self-regulation as a whole. At the level of information and knowledge, the brain can correctly interpret body signals (not misjudge normal signals as abnormal), and the internal environment of the body is stable to provide the information basis needed for brain decision-making, and the decision-making at the Wisdom level can effectively maintain homeostasis. In disease states, this coupling is disrupted, and the following patterns may occur: (<strong>a</strong>) <strong>information mismatch</strong>: the brain misinterprets signals from the body or has abnormal thresholds, such as the brain of a patient with chronic pain who continues to receive over-amplified pain information, or the hypothalamus of a diabetic patient has a reduced sensitivity to blood glucose signals, resulting in a broken information chain; (<strong>b</strong>) <strong>Knowledge conflict</strong>: the original cognition of the brain does not match the real state of the body, such as the patient's lack of knowledge of the disease (knowledge deficit) leading to neglect of symptoms, or the body produces new pathological feedback (such as drug resistance) beyond the existing knowledge system of the brain, resulting in cognitive uncertainty; (<strong>c</strong>) <strong>Wisdom decision bias</strong>: the central decision is no longer optimal, for example, obese patients make overeating decisions driven by strong appetite (Purpose layer shift), and the Wisdom layer regulation fails; (<strong>d</strong>) <strong>Purpose disorder</strong>: the patient's subjective will is disconnected from the body's needs, such as depressed patients who know the need to exercise but are depressed, and the body's long-term lack of exercise leads to a decline in function, which further exacerbates the negative emotional feedback of the brain. Through the analysis of different types of dissonance modes, the general characteristic parameters of cognitive coupling imbalance (such as signal gain, threshold offset, feedback delay, etc.) are extracted. Then, based on these parameters, quantifiable evaluation indicators were established in the model to measure the health of brain-body coupling. For example, the definition of \"brain-body synergy index\" comprehensively reflects the consistency of information flow and the integrity of the feedback loop at each layer, and the decrease in synergy indicates abnormal interaction. Finally, the model and indicators were used to summarize and explain the phenomena of subsequent disease studies (see research content 2), and the applicability and generalization of the model were verified.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>1.3 Empirical Validation and Model Refinement:</strong> In order to ensure that the DIKWP brain-body model conforms to the actual biological laws, this section will combine small-scale experiments or existing data to validate and modify the model. On the one hand, examples of brain-body interaction that are easy to control on animals are selected, such as the rodent stress model: by applying chronic stress to mice, the changes of the HPA axis and immune response are observed, and the obtained time series data is simulated and output against the model to test the prediction ability of the model on the interaction between data layer, information layer and knowledge layer. If the model can reproduce the actual observation (e.g., dynamic changes in hormones and cytokines caused by stress, as well as behavioral manifestations), then the model parameters are reasonable; If there is a large deviation, adjust the relevant connection weights or function forms in the model. On the other hand, clinical datasets were utilized for retrospective analysis. For example, for patients with heart failure, the association between autonomic function indicators (heart rate variability, etc.) and cognitive function scores can be extracted, and the relationship between autonomic nervous system (body information layer) and cognitive state (brain knowledge/wisdom layer) can be explained by the model, and whether the model can predict the change trend of cognitive status in heart failure patients. Through multi-case verification, the model structure is continuously improved to make it both theoretical and biologically reasonable. Final output: Published a set of theoretical models and index systems of brain-body interaction; The model may be provided in the form of an appendix in pseudocode or an open-source simulation program to provide a tool platform for further research in the academic community.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expected innovation:</strong> This research will be the first to propose a DIKWP cognitive model of brain-body interaction to achieve a unified description of bio-psychological processes. Internationally, although there are conceptual models of brain-gut axis and brain-immune interaction, most of them focus on specific physiological pathways and lack an abstract cognitive framework. The introduction of our model into the cognitive level of artificial intelligence is expected to become a new theoretical tool in the field of psychosomatic medicine. The bidirectional interaction of this model also provides a paradigm for explaining complex system diseases, which can be generalized to the study of other systems (such as neuro-endocrine system).</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-Research-on-the-mechanism-of-central-peripheral-regulatory-disorders-of-typical-chronic-diseases\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-Research-on-the-mechanism-of-central-peripheral-regulatory-disorders-of-typical-chronic-diseases\" title=\"2. Research on the mechanism of central-peripheral regulatory disorders of typical chronic diseases\"></a><strong>2. Research on the mechanism of central-peripheral regulatory disorders of typical chronic diseases</strong></h2><p><strong>Overview:</strong> This section focuses on four common major chronic diseases, namely metabolic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, tumors, and chronic respiratory diseases, and deeply studies <strong>the dysfunctional mechanisms of brain-body interaction in their respective pathological states</strong>. Through the combination of basic and clinical research, the disorder pattern of peripheral regulation of the center and the reverse regulation of the peripheral pathological environment on the central cognitive-emotional function are clarified**. To summarize** the commonality and specificity of brain-body interaction disorders in different diseases, and lay a foundation for the formulation of intervention strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>Specific research contents:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>2.1 Brain-body regulatory imbalance in metabolic diseases:</strong> Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are selected as representatives. To study the disturbance of the feedback mechanism between the weight regulation center of the brain (hypothalamus, etc.) and the peripheral metabolic organs (islets, adipose tissue, intestine) in the context of metabolic syndrome. noted that higher brain regions and circadian rhythms play an important role in regulating metabolism. We will observe the activation of the hypothalamus and reward center in obese/diabetic patients under the state of eating, insulin release, etc., through functional MRI and metabolic provocation test, and compare their neural responses with healthy controls. The secretion rhythm of peripheral hormones (e.g., leptin, insulin, ghrelin) and target tissue sensitivity were also measured. Hypothesis: Obese/diabetic patients have decreased central sensitivity (eg, leptin resistance leading to hypothalamic sluggishness to fat signaling, information layer disorder) and abnormal peripheral feedback (eg, insulin resistance leading to prolonged deviation of blood glucose signals from the normal range, brain misinformation). Using the brain-body DIKWP model, it can be described that the input of the brain information layer is distorted, and the cognition of the knowledge layer about energy balance is disrupted, so that the decision-making (appetite control) of the wisdom layer fails. Further, to investigate how these metabolic disorders affect cognitive function and mood: cognitive tests (such as executive function, memory) and mood scale assessments were performed to analyze whether patients with poor glycemic control had worse cognitive performance, and the correlation between chronic inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α, etc.) and depression scores. Studies suggest that chronic inflammation and immune activation are risk factors for cognitive impairment and depression. We expect this to be verified in metabolic diseases such as diabetes: <strong>low-grade chronic inflammation affects hippocampal memory function through the blood-brain barrier or vagus nerve, resulting in mild cognitive impairment and depressed mood, i.e., the reverse regulation of the center by the periphery. Combining these results, we can draw a model of the brain-body-immune imbalance in metabolic diseases</strong>, reveal the mechanism of the vicious cycle between obesity, inflammation and cognition, and propose corresponding intervention targets (such as reducing inflammation or improving leptin sensitivity to restore brain-body information coupling).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>2.2 Brain-body interaction disorders in cardiovascular diseases:</strong> hypertension and coronary heart disease are the main research objects. The cardiovascular system is regulated by the sympathetic/parasympathetic and endocrine systems (adrenal hormones, etc.), while heart disease can also affect the blood supply to the brain and the neuroendocrine state. We will first study the relationship between psychological stress and cardiovascular events: stress tests (public speaking or mental arithmetic) will be used to induce stress responses in subjects, changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and cortisol levels will be recorded, and limbic and autonomic activity will be measured by MRI or near-infrared. The goal is to elucidate <strong>the transient brain-heart interaction patterns in acute stress and the cumulative effects of chronic stress in patients with hypertension (e.g., persistent increase in sympathetic tension). Theoretically, chronic mental stress can lead to sympathetic overactivation and vagus nerve inhibition, resulting in vasoconstriction and persistently high heart rate, while repeated stimulation of the HPA axis leads to an increase in cortisol, promoting atherosclerosis and endothelial damage. We will measure levels of stress-related hormones and inflammatory factors in patients with hypertension and coronary heart disease, and assess their cognitive function (e.g., executive function, attention) and emotional state to verify that chronic stress passes through the nerves</strong>- The endocrine-immune pathway causes a chain of cardiovascular deterioration and cognitive and emotional alterations. If the data support it, we will be able to describe the \"brain-cardioaxis\" vicious cycle with a brain-body model: under stress stimulation, the amygdala/thalamus of the brain triggers sympathetic output (data/information layer overload), leading to an overload of the cardiovascular system (disorder of the body's Wisdom layer), in turn, hypertension and heart failure cause insufficient oxygen supply to the brain and an increase in inflammatory factors (the body feeds abnormal information back to the brain knowledge layer), which ultimately leads to depressed mood and cognitive decline (damage to the brain's Purpose/Wisdom layer). In addition, to study the direct effects of heart disease on the brain, such as cognitive decline common in patients with atrial fibrillation and coronary heart disease, we will use brain imaging to observe alterations in cerebral perfusion and functional connectivity, and speculate on how chronic decreased cardiac output, repeated microembolism, etc., affect brain networks, thereby adding these pathways to the model. Finally, the possibility of positive regulation, such as cardiac rehabilitation training (exercise, meditation, etc.) on the improvement of autonomic balance and brain plasticity, and its mechanism was incorporated into the model to provide ideas for intervention.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>2.3 Mind-body interaction mechanism in tumor diseases:</strong> Malignant tumors are a special type of chronic diseases, and their progression is not only affected by the biological behavior of tumor cells, but also by neuroimmune factors. A large number of psychoneuroimmunological studies have shown that chronic psychological stress is closely related to the occurrence and development of certain tumors. In this section, we will examine the brain-body interaction characteristics of cancer patients, focusing on the <strong>neuro-immune-tumor tripartite relationship. On the one hand, to study how the imbalance in the regulation of immunity in the center affects tumors</strong>: recruit a group of treated cancer patients, assess their stress levels (e.g., anxiety and depression scales), measure sympathetic indicators (heart rate variability, norepinephrine) and HPA axis hormones, and peripheral immune function (peripheral blood NK cell activity, T cell subset ratio, inflammatory factor levels). Patients with high psychological stress were analyzed for hypersympathetic and immunosuppressive states, such as decreased NK cell activity and suppressed Th1 immune response. Combined with follow-up data, to see if this is associated with higher rates of tumor progression or metastasis. Expected results: Chronic stress can mediate immune evasion through sympathetic-adrenal glands, accelerating tumor growth. On the other hand, to study the impact of tumors and their treatment on the center: many cancer patients experience \"chemobrain\" (decline in cognitive function) and mood disorders. We will conduct neuropsychological testing and brain imaging examinations before, during, and after treatment for a group of breast cancer/lung cancer patients, combined with the detection of peripheral inflammatory factors and metabolites, to explore the ways in which chemotherapy drugs and tumor metabolites affect the brain through the periphery. For example, cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor may induce central inflammation, leading to impaired memory and attention; Anemia or malnutrition caused by certain chemotherapy drugs can affect the brain's energy supply. Through longitudinal data, we established a dynamic association model between the physical state **and brain function of cancer patients. Based on the above research, the \"**brain-tumor-immunity\" sub-model was improved: when patients are under psychological stress, the brain releases norepinephrine through sympathetic nerves to promote angiogenesis and immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (the body information layer changes the tumor knowledge layer); Factors released by the tumor and side effects of treatment in turn impair cognition and mood (peripheral lesions ascend to the central Wisdom/Purpose layer). This cycle will be used to explain the mechanisms by which some patients experience accelerated tumor progression after a stressful event, or remain chronically depressed after tumor remission.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>2.4 Brain-body interactions in chronic respiratory diseases:</strong> represented by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchial asthma. The respiratory system is closely connected to the central nervous system through blood and gas changes and nerve reflexes, and lung disease is often accompanied by central symptoms such as dyspnea, anxiety, and cognitive decline. This section will investigate the interaction between dyspnea, emotion, and cognition in patients with chronic lung disease. On the one hand, the changes in blood gas, cerebral oxygen, and brain electrical activity of COPD patients after resting and exercise, as well as the corresponding subjective dyspnea scores and anxiety scores, were measured. It is hypothesized that hypoxic hypercapnia triggers a broad response from the brain center, including bulbar respiratory center excitation and limbic system activation, causing the patient to feel the fear of choking (a centrally generated information-layer experience), which in turn induces anxiety attacks. This peripheral pathology-induced central panic can be described by the model as the abnormality of the body's data layer (hypoxia) is mistakenly amplified by the brain as a strong threat message, which is beyond the rational regulation of the Wisdom layer. On the other hand, the effects of anxiety on asthma are studied: asthma is a typical psychosomatic disorder, and mood changes often induce or worsen asthma symptoms. We will induce mild anxiety (e.g., watching stress films) in asthma patients, monitor airway response and autonomic markers, and see if anxiety causes bronchoconstriction through increased vagal tone. Expected results: Increased vagus nerve activity in the anxious state caused bronchial smooth muscle contraction and increased airway resistance, resulting in subjective chest tightness and the formation of an <strong>emotional-respiratory feedback loop</strong>。 In addition, the long-term effects of systemic chronic inflammation and repeated hypoxia on cognition in COPD patients are also worth paying attention to: we will conduct neuropsychological assessment of COPD patients, focusing on executive function and memory, measuring whether the levels of inflammatory markers (CRP, etc.) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are abnormal, and exploring whether chronic respiratory failure promotes central chronic inflammation and neurodegenerative changes. Incorporate the findings into a brain-body model: pulmonary insufficiency prevents the body's Wisdom layer from providing adequate oxygen, and peripheral metabolic waste retention continues to stimulate the vagus nerve, which may lead to partial functional decline of the central body in the long term. This model could explain the symptoms of inattention and memory loss, which are common in patients with chronic lung disease. To summarize this section, a two-way imbalance model of the \"brain-lung axis\" is formed: chronic hypoxia and inflammation cause chronic fatigue and anxiety in the brain, which in turn further exacerbates dyspnea, and the cycle continues. Intervention hypotheses: a two-pronged approach, such as neuromodulation training of respiratory muscles and anti-anxiety therapy, may break this cycle.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expected results:</strong> Through this study, we will obtain empirical data and mechanistic models of brain-body interaction disorders in four major chronic diseases. These models not only provide a detailed explanation of specific disease pathways, but also map to the DIKWP abstract model at a higher level. It is expected that a number of research papers will be published, such as: \"Research on the mechanism of brain-gut-pancreatic axis information mismatch in metabolic syndrome\", \"The impact of brain-heart interaction on cognition in patients with chronic heart failure\", \"Study on stress-immunity-recurrence pathway in breast cancer patients\", \"Brain-lung axis function reconstruction in COPD patients\", etc. More importantly, we will refine the common laws across diseases, such as the \"inflammation-cognitive symptoms\" connection that is prevalent in chronic diseases, and the mechanism of \"autonomic imbalance-organ damage\", so as to provide a targeted entry point for subsequent artificial consciousness intervention. These research contents will be at the forefront of international exploration, because there are few projects that can conduct a unified comparative analysis of the brain-body interaction mechanism of so many chronic diseases. The results will enrich the systematic understanding of chronic diseases and provide a scientific basis for the development of comprehensive intervention strategies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-Research-on-cognitive-metabolic-immune-three-dimensional-regulation-and-Purpose-layer-disorder-based-on-artificial-consciousness\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-Research-on-cognitive-metabolic-immune-three-dimensional-regulation-and-Purpose-layer-disorder-based-on-artificial-consciousness\" title=\"3. Research on cognitive-metabolic-immune three-dimensional regulation and Purpose layer disorder based on artificial consciousness\"></a><strong>3. Research on cognitive-metabolic-immune three-dimensional regulation and Purpose layer disorder based on artificial consciousness</strong></h2><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Based on the above-mentioned brain-body models and disease mechanism studies, this section introduces the theory of artificial consciousness, focusing on the problem of higher-order neurological dysfunction (Purpose layer disorder) in chronic diseases. By establishing a three-dimensional regulatory model of \"cognition-metabolism-immunity\", this paper simulates the changes of patients' self-awareness, purpose and motivation in the state of chronic disease, and explores how the disorder of the purpose layer leads to the chronicity of disease behavior. The aim of this study is to reveal the deep coupling mechanism between psychological awareness factors and the biological processes of chronic diseases, and to provide a theoretical basis for Purpose layer intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Specific research contents:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>3.1 Cognitive-Metabolism-Immunity Three-dimensional Integration Model Construction:</strong> Based on the existing brain-body DIKWP model, a dimension is further expanded to include artificial consciousness elements, that is, <strong>an explicit representation of cognitive/conscious states is added to the model. This can be seen as</strong> embedding a meta-layer of \"state of consciousness\" on top of the five layers of the brain DIKWP (especially the Wisdom and Purpose layers), or refining the brain DIKWP model, where the Purpose layer includes subjective consciousness and motivation submodules. At the same time, the body-side model was refined to include key links in the immune system and metabolic system. Therefore, the new 3D model includes: <strong>cognitive dimension</strong> (cognitive/conscious processes of the brain, including perception, emotion, purpose, etc.), <strong>metabolic dimension</strong> (systemic metabolic internal environment, such as endocrine, energy state), and <strong>immune dimension</strong>(immune system status, e.g., inflammation levels, cellular immune function). The three form a three-dimensional network through multiple couplings. For example, cognitive-immune coupling: cerebral cortex and limbic activity can affect immune cells through the neuroendocrine pathway (eg, stress leads to decreased lymphocyte function), and cytokines released by immune cells can affect brain signaling through the blood-brain barrier (eg, IL-1 causes fever and drowsiness); Cognitive-metabolic coupling: the brain monitors and regulates the body's energy status (hunger, satiety, etc.), and metabolic hormones such as insulin and thyroid hormones also regulate brain function (affecting memory and attention); Metabolite-immune coupling: Metabolites can regulate immune cell activity (e.g., fatty acids promote inflammation), and the metabolic state of immune cells determines their function (e.g., immunodeficiency due to malnutrition). By collating the literature, we will identify the main interaction loops between the three dimensions and integrate them into the model structure. Next, a formal description and simulation scheme of the model are tried: for example, based on system dynamics, a system of differential equations is established to describe the changes of cognitive-metabolic-immune indicators over time and the interaction between them. Or use agent-based modeling to build three agents of brain, immunity, and metabolism, and reflect interaction through message transmission. The model will be tested with scenarios such as chronic stress or infection, and the correctness will be verified by known experimental rules (e.g., whether the pathways of long-term high-fat diet→ obesity→ chronic inflammation → cognitive decline can be simulated by the model). This three-dimensional integrated model is an important supplement to the DIKWP framework, which enables our theoretical framework to explain the synergistic regulation of psychology, metabolism, and immunity at the same time, and to have a more comprehensive systematic grasp of complex chronic diseases.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>3.2 Simulation of Patient Self-perception and Purpose Dysfunction: The</strong> artificial consciousness theory, especially the Purpose layer of the DIKWP model, is used to simulate the changes of higher-order cognitive function in patients with chronic diseases. We will quantitatively model and simulate the diminished self-perception and impaired motivation that are prevalent in chronic diseases**. Firstly, the subjective state of patients with common chronic diseases (such as diabetes, heart failure, COPD, and cancer remission) was analyzed through patient surveys and psychological assessment scales**, including: illness perception, treatment intention, goal planning ability, motivation level, etc. Expected findings: Many patients with chronic diseases have a tendency of \"learned helplessness\", <strong>that is, due to long-term illness setbacks, which leads to a decrease in self-efficacy, and believes that no matter how hard they try, their condition will not improve, and then their willingness to actively manage is reduced. This manifests as intent strength decay at the Purpose layer. At the same time, chronic diseases are often accompanied by depression or cognitive decline, which makes the patient's perception of body signals dull or negative (such as pain, fatigue and other signals are habitually tolerated and lack of active response). In view of these characteristics, we will try to use the DIKWP model to characterize the target instructions generated by the Purpose layer in the DIKWP of the brain</strong> , and the driving force of the lower level Wisdom decision is insufficient; The information layer may desensitize to negative physical signals or over-ignore them (filtering at the cognitive level leads to the failure of risk information to rise to the knowledge level decision-making). We parameterize these cognitive impairments in the model, for example, by setting a \"Purpose threshold\" that represents motivation to act, and when this value falls below a certain threshold, the Wisdom layer will not act on a behavior (exercise, follow-up, etc.) even if it knows that it is good for health. Then, the long-term trend of the disease under different intensities was simulated on an integrated cognitive-metabolic-immune model: the changes in physiological parameters, such as blood glucose, blood pressure, and lung function, were compared between the \"high purpose\" (active cooperation with management) and the \"low purpose\" (patient passive procrastination) scenarios. If the model can reproduce the trends observed in reality (positive patients have a better prognosis, negative patients are prone to worsening), then further analyze the internal mechanism: low purpose leads to poor treatment adherence (e.g., not taking medication on time, not exercising), persists or worsens metabolic/immune abnormalities, and in turn, worsening chronic disease symptoms reinforces the patient's sense of helplessness, forming a <strong>positive feedback loop of Purpose layer disorder-disease exacerbation</strong>. We will pay special attention to <strong>the association between Purpose and immunity, hypothetizing that low</strong> Purpose leads to chronic stress and depression, and then inhibits immune function through neuroimmune pathways, such as the case of decreased immunity and accelerated tumor progression after cancer patients lose their will to survive. This phenomenon can be explained and predicted by models. These simulations are not only theoretical, but also provide a basis for interventions: we will propose a key hypothesis that <strong>enhancing the patient's Purpose layer can reverse the adverse trend of chronic disease</strong>, which will be tested in the next intervention study.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>3.3 Validation of association between Purpose layer disorder and chronic disease behavior:</strong> To correspond model predictions to the real world, we will validate the <strong>association of Purpose disorder indicators with disease outcomes in a cohort of patients with chronic diseases. Design a prospective study: recruit a certain number of patients with chronic diseases (can be multi-disease), and evaluate their psychological and</strong> purpose-related indicators, such as Disease Perception Questionnaire (IPQ), Intrinsic Motivation Scale for Treatment, Depression and Anxiety Scores, etc., at baseline; Objective disease indicators and recent disease control levels were recorded at the same time. Follow-up for 1-2 years was followed up to monitor the clinical outcomes (occurrence of complications, number of hospitalizations, degree of disease progression, etc.). Patients were grouped by baseline purpose/motivation level and outcomes were compared between the different groups. Patients with <strong>low Purpose have a significantly worse prognosis if results show a significantly worse outcome</strong> (e.g., in diabetes, patients who are unwilling to engage in lifestyle interventions have more complications; In coronary heart disease, patients who lack the willingness to recover are at higher risk of second myocardial infarction), which confirms that <strong>the purpose layer disorder is indeed an important contributing factor to the chronicity of chronic disease behavior</strong>。 Furthermore, the multivariate regression model was used to eliminate other effects, and the independent contribution of the Purpose factor to the outcome was quantified. For example, calculate how much the risk of death increases for every certain increase in depression score; For every certain amount of reduction in intrinsic motivation for treatment, how much does the blood glucose attainment rate decrease. These statistical results will feed back to refine our theoretical model and make it more predictive. During the validation process, we will also take care to distinguish correlation from causation: there may be reverse causality (the severity of the disease causes the purpose to be low). Therefore, the structural equation model and other methods can be combined to construct a model of the mutual causal relationship between Purpose and disease, and the longitudinal data can be used to verify the causal direction. Causal inference is supported if model fitting shows that the Purpose layer variables have a significant impact on subsequent disease indicators. Finally, the findings are summarized as the theoretical framework of \"Purpose-Chronic Disease Behavior\": that is, in the process of chronic disease, subjective factors such as patients' purpose/motivation play a key moderating role, and their disorders can accelerate the deterioration of the disease, and adjusting these higher-order factors is expected to change the trajectory of the disease. This framework breaks through the traditional view of separating the biological and the psychological, and reflects the application potential of artificial consciousness theory in medicine.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expected Results:</strong> This study will form a new understanding of the psychophysiological coupling of chronic diseases**, including the publication of cognitive-metabolic-immune** three-dimensional models (theoretical papers), and the data reporting of the impact of patients' motivation on chronic disease outcomes (clinical papers). At the same time, the <strong>new concept of purpose-level intervention is refined: patients are regarded as \"cognitive systems\" rather than just \"organisms\", and chronic diseases are managed by improving their subjective initiative. These results will directly guide the design of the next intervention system, provide a humanized and holistic perspective for chronic disease management, and also have enlightening significance for public health policies (such as chronic disease health education).</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"4-Research-on-the-design-and-application-of-digital-intervention-system-driven-by-artificial-consciousness\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-Research-on-the-design-and-application-of-digital-intervention-system-driven-by-artificial-consciousness\" title=\"4.

Research on the design and application of digital intervention system driven by artificial consciousness</strong></h2><p><strong>Overview:</strong> On the basis of fully grasping the brain-body interaction mechanism and the law of the purpose layer, this part will enter the application transformation stage to design and develop an \"artificial consciousness-driven digital intervention system\". The system embeds the DIKWP artificial awareness model into the chronic disease management process, including three main functional modules: cognitive layer monitoring, <strong>purpose activation feedback</strong>, and <strong>digital behavior reconstruction. We will prototype and iteratively optimize the system, and conduct preliminary application studies to evaluate its effect on individualized regulation and rehabilitation, and explore new ways to translate research results into clinical practice.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Specific research contents:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>4.1 The overall architecture and key technologies of the intervention system:</strong> According to the above design, the framework concept of the system has been proposed in the technical route. Here, the system architecture diagram and key module interfaces are formulated in detail, and the required technical solutions are clarified. In general, the system adopts a <strong>client-cloud combination model: the patient side is a mobile phone application or wearable device interface, and the cloud is an artificial awareness AI engine and data analysis platform. Key technical points include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Multimodal data collection and fusion:</strong> Wearable sensor devices are integrated to obtain physiological data (heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose, activity level, sleep, etc.), and mobile applications to obtain patients' subjective input (symptom punch-in, mood diary, questionnaire), environmental data (positioning, climate), etc. Data preprocessing and feature extraction algorithms are developed to convert heterogeneous data into data layer inputs (numerical normalization, event labeling, etc.) of the DIKWP model, and semantic annotations are performed at the information layer (such as detecting hyperglycemia events and insomnia events). Ensure reliable data collection and privacy security.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Artificial Consciousness Engine (DIKWP Cognitive Computing Module):</strong> This is the core of the system, which realizes cognitive reasoning and decision-making on the patient's state based on the DIKWP model. We will use the existing cognitive computing framework and reinforcement learning algorithms to customize the development according to the specific needs of this project. For example, a five-layer neural network or hierarchical Bayesian network is constructed to simulate the DIKWP process: the bottom sensing node receives data features, the middle layer performs pattern recognition (such as finding symptom patterns), the higher layer combines the knowledge base to judge risks, and the top layer outputs intervention suggestions (Purpose-driven). Introduce a knowledge base (including medical guidelines and expert rules) and a cognitive feedback mechanism to make AI decision-making conform to medical laws and be explainable. <strong>The two-way feedback mechanism will be implemented here:</strong> the top-level purpose of the AI will dynamically adjust the type and frequency of the data features of concern (for example, if the AI judges that the patient's psychological risk has increased in the near future, it will strengthen the frequency of emotion-related data monitoring), and at the same time, the data-driven correction of the AI's internal state (such as continuous blood glucose abnormalities will allow the AI to improve the assessment of the risk of complications). This design embodies the idea of DIKWP mesh interaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Personalized User Models and Purpose Computing:</strong> Maintain a digital twin model of each patient in the AI engine, recording their unique physiological-psychological characteristics and behavior patterns. Analyze historical data through machine learning and continuously update the parameters of the patient model to make interventions more personalized. For example, for patients with poor adherence, the model will mark their Purpose layer as less dynamic, and the intervention will be formulated with a focus on motivation and supervision; For patients with high self-discipline, more information level knowledge support is given. Purpose calculation refers to inferring the patient's intrinsic purpose state based on the patient's current context, such as using algorithms based on affective computing and motivational reasoning to detect the patient's emotions and intentions from the patient's language and behavior (for example, if the patient's tone is low and the motivation is low through the analysis of dialogue text, the Purpose level is judged to be low).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Human-computer interaction and feedback interface:</strong> Designed a user-friendly interface that supports multi-modal interaction (text, voice, expression, etc.). The system will interact with patients in the form of \"artificial awareness assistants\", such as providing personalized greetings and health advice every morning, reminding them to take medication and asking about subjective feelings at noon, and summarizing the day's status in the evening to give encouragement or advice. If an abnormality is detected (such as a persistent low mood or a sudden increase in blood pressure), the assistant will take the initiative to intervene or notify the medical staff. Interaction information is transformed into updates to patient models and subsequent decision-making in the background. The interface design will focus on incentive mechanisms, such as achievement badges, milestones, social sharing, etc., to improve patient stickiness and engagement.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>4.2 Implementation and testing of core functional modules:</strong> According to the above architecture, the three core functional modules of the system are implemented one by one, and unit tests and integration tests are carried out in the experimental environment.<br/>After completing the development and testing of the above modules, enter the system integration and deploy all the modules together to run. By simulating the whole process trial operation of different user scenarios (various disease combinations and various abnormal working conditions), the stability and response speed of the system are checked, and the bugs are repaired in time. The result is a beta intervention system that can be piloted.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Cognitive state monitoring module development:</strong> Use the existing IoT development board and sensor components to build a prototype monitoring device; Develop mobile phone applications to access third-party wearable device data. Write a data collection daemon to realize real-time data upload. Develop basic data analysis scripts, such as heart rate variability calculations, sleep stage analysis, sentiment analysis (natural language processing can be used to determine the emotional polarity of diary text). The stability of the data link was tested in a laboratory setting with healthy subjects and some patients, and the data fusion algorithm was adjusted to reduce noise false positives. Ensure that the module can correctly process all types of input situations (normal/abnormal, physiological/behavioral) and output a uniform format of feature streams.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Purpose: Activation and feedback module development:</strong> Select an appropriate dialog system framework (e.g., GPT-based large model API, with custom constraints) to build an interactive agent. Write conversation scripts and reinforcement learning rewards to enable AI assistants to communicate with users in a guided manner. For example, when a patient expresses frustration, the assistant will comfort and propose a small goal for them to accomplish, activating their purpose. Implement \"virtual coaching\" features – such as real-time voice encouragement from an assistant during a workout and positive feedback at the end of the workout. For the Purpose calculation part, a classification model can be trained to map the sequence of recent user behaviors to the Purpose layer, such as \"High Purpose\", \"Medium Purpose\", and \"Low Purpose\" to determine the intensity of the interaction strategy (low Purpose means strong intervention, and High Purpose means weak reminder). When testing the module, you can ask the test person to pretend to be a different scenario and talk to the assistant to check that the response is expected and empathetic. Iteratively refine your conversation strategy and avoid blunt or offensive tones.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Digital Behavior Reconstruction Module Development:</strong> This part deals with the digital implementation of specific interventions. Different sub-functions are designed according to different diseases, such as: diet management plug-in for diabetic patients (recording diet and giving health scores and recommended recipes); Breathing and relaxation training for patients with hypertension (provide instructional audio, practice daily and monitor the effect); Videos of breathing exercises and rehabilitation exercises for COPD patients; Mindfulness meditation sessions for cancer survivors, etc. Integrate these capabilities into the app to allow AI to be pushed to patients as needed. Establish a correlation between behaviour and outcomes: e.g., assess how well the patient is performing the intervention (whether the number of steps is up to standard, whether the diet is in line with recommendations) in combination with monitoring data, and provide immediate feedback. Through reinforcement learning, the system gradually learns to choose the most appropriate intervention for the patient (e.g., if a patient is found to be more willing to accept a gamification challenge, a game-based intervention is used). During the test, let small patients experience these features for 1-2 weeks, and collect feedback questionnaires to see which features are popular and which are difficult to use, so as to improve the details of the interaction and the content fit.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>4.3 Pilot application and effect evaluation of the intervention system:</strong> Select cooperative medical institutions or communities to carry out pilot application research of the system. Specific plan: Recruit about 30-50 patients with chronic diseases (which can be concentrated in one disease or include multiple diseases) and use the intervention system provided by the project for 3-6 months. The study used a single-group before-and-after control design or compared with historical controls to evaluate the effects of systematic interventions on all aspects of patients. The main observation indicators included:<br/>evaluating the effectiveness and safety of the intervention system through comprehensive analysis of the above data. If the effect is significant, for example, the improvement in metabolic markers in the AI intervention group is significantly higher than that of conventional management, then this will demonstrate the value of artificial awareness-driven intervention. AI personalized feedback has been shown to improve metabolic control, and this study is expected to further improve the effect. If something isn't working well, dig deeper into the cause and may need to improve the feature or algorithm in a subsequent release. Based on the results of the pilot, a version upgrade plan of the intervention system was formed to prepare for the next large-scale promotion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Improvement of physiological indicators:</strong> such as changes in mean blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels in diabetic patients, blood pressure attainment rate in hypertensive patients, 6-minute walking distance and lung function in COPD patients, etc. Compare the differences before and after the intervention or between the control group and expect to see some improvement.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Psychological and cognitive indicators:</strong> Standard scales were used to evaluate whether patients had reduced levels of depression and anxiety, whether quality of life (SF-36, etc.) was improved, and whether cognitive test scores were improved. Particular attention is paid to changes in initiative and adherence, as measured by questionnaires or system logs (e.g., the percentage of homework completed per day). It is expected that the self-efficacy of health management will be improved after the intervention.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Medical outcomes:</strong> The number of acute exacerbations during the intervention period, the number of unplanned medical visits, and whether they were reduced compared with the same length before the intervention. Long-term follow-up to observe whether it affects the hospitalization rate.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>User experience:</strong> Interviews or questionnaires are used to understand patients' acceptance and satisfaction with the system, including how much they like the image of an AIA, whether the interactive content is helpful, and which features are most useful. Gather suggestions for optimization.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Adverse events:</strong> monitor for adverse effects due to systemic interventions, such as overdependence and increased anxiety (generally low, but concerning).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>4.4 System optimization and promotion preparation:</strong> According to the feedback from the pilot, the system will be optimized and improved in the final stage of the project. For example, improving the user-friendliness of the user interface, increasing the patient community communication function (allowing patients using the system to share their experiences with each other to increase motivation), enriching AI dialogue materials to avoid duplication, and strengthening data security and privacy protection measures. Technically, if necessary, higher performance AI models or knowledge bases can be introduced to augment the content of medical guidance. Then, the user manual and training materials of the system are developed to prepare for the subsequent roll-out. At the same time, condense the technical achievements of the project, apply for software copyright or invention patents, and ensure the protection of intellectual property rights. Finally, the application specifications and efficacy evidence of the digital intervention system were summarized and formed, and the system was promoted to the medical management department and the industry. For example, writing a report recommending to health authorities the introduction of the system as an adjunct to the management of chronic diseases, or exploring with insurance institutions the inclusion of digital therapeutics in health management services. Carry out academic exchanges, present the system at digital health-related conferences, and expand its influence. Actively look for industry partners, explore productization and commercial promotion paths, and lay the foundation for the subsequent transformation of the project.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expected Results:</strong> This research will directly produce an intelligent intervention system with prototype application value. In the short term, the system can be piloted and promoted as a digital health product in chronic disease management; In the long run, the artificial consciousness model and human-computer interaction concept behind it can be extended to more medical fields (such as mental health and self-care). Through the implementation of the project, we expect to publish 1-2 papers or reports on the design and test results of the system, apply for relevant patents and software copyrights, and realize the closed loop from theoretical innovation to technological innovation. More importantly, this system verifies the feasibility of the new intervention strategy of \"artificial awareness + digital health\", creates a new path of comprehensive physical and mental intervention for chronic diseases, and provides a practical tool for improving the management effect of chronic diseases.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Feasibility-analysis\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Feasibility-analysis\" title=\"Feasibility analysis\"></a><strong>Feasibility analysis</strong></h1><p>The project has ambitious goals and complex contents, but it has a solid preliminary foundation and good implementation conditions, and has high feasibility:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Multidisciplinary research team:</strong> Prof. Yucong Duan, the project applicant, has been engaged in the basic theoretical research of cognitive computing and artificial intelligence for a long time, and is the proposer and leading expert of the DIKWP model. Since winning the Wu Wenjun Artificial Intelligence Award in 2020, his team has continuously deepened the theory of DIKWP and established a special artificial consciousness laboratory. As of 2022, Prof. Yucong Duan has applied for more than 240 domestic and international patents related to DIKWP, covering artificial intelligence, blockchain, semantic web and other directions. These achievements reflect the team's strong innovation and research and development capabilities. At the same time, the project has established a cross-field cooperation network with clinical medical experts and biologists, including clinical experts in endocrinology and metabolism, cardiovascular, oncology, and respiratory, as well as psychology and bioinformatics researchers. Such a multidisciplinary team ensures that the project has professional support in both medical mechanism and technical realization, and the <strong>cross-collaboration advantage is obvious.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2. Preliminary work and basic data:</strong> In terms of brain-body interaction and chronic disease research, our team members have carried out some preliminary explorations. For example, the medical experts of the team have participated in the project of \"Psychological Stress and Cardiovascular Events\" of the National Key Research and Development Program, and have accumulated data and analysis models on the impact of stress on hypertension. In the direction of tumors, the cooperative units have longitudinal cohorts of cancer patients, which can provide follow-up data of psychological and immune indicators; In the field of metabolic diseases, we have a pilot study on lifestyle interventions for diabetic patients, which has preliminarily validated the role of digital management in improving adherence. These preliminary works have provided valuable data and experience that will help to fast-track the relevant research in this project. In addition, the DIKWP Artificial Awareness Lab of the applicant team has developed an evaluation platform and some software frameworks for the DIKWP model, and has practical experience in the implementation of DIKWP in artificial intelligence systems. These technical reserves will be directly used for the system development of this project to reduce the difficulty of implementation.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Both technical feasibility and innovation: The</strong> project is innovative in theory, but the feasibility is fully considered in the selection of technical routes. For example, data collection will rely primarily on proven wearables and mobile application technologies, without the need to reinvent hardware; The artificial intelligence part will be transformed into our theoretical framework with the help of the current advanced large model API and reinforcement learning algorithms, which has a basis for implementation. When it comes to digital interventions, there are already a number of successful digital health products, such as mobile apps for diabetes management, that provide a template for us to innovate by adding an element of human awareness that doesn't completely deviate from existing technologies. Therefore, the <strong>risk is controllable</strong>: even if the artificial awareness module does not work as expected, we can still take a step back and use traditional algorithms to ensure that the basic functions are realized. At the same time, each module has parallel sub-goals, the research plan arranges iterative verification, and the results of each stage will feed back to the follow-up, and <strong>the incremental development reduces the overall risk. In response to possible challenges (such as difficulty in cross-system data fusion and high complexity of human-computer interaction), we have relevant experts in our team to tackle them, and reserve mobile resources to deal with them.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4. Abundant research support conditions:</strong> The relying unit has perfect scientific research conditions, including: the brain imaging center can support fMRI experiments, the cooperative departments of the hospital can recruit patients and collect clinical data, the high-performance computing server cluster can meet the needs of AI model training, and the laboratory animal center can carry out animal experiment verification. In addition, the project has received support and commitment from the universities and affiliated hospitals to facilitate ethical approval, data sharing, and equipment use. In terms of funding, this project belongs to the direction of the national key R&amp;D plan, and the application funds are sufficient, which will be used for equipment purchase (such as wearable devices, test terminals), clinical trial subsidies and R&amp;D manpower support, which can meet the research needs. In terms of management, the team will establish a regular communication mechanism, set up the heads of each module and node milestones, and the scientific research management department of the relying unit will also assist in monitoring the progress and financial implementation of the project to ensure the <strong>smooth implementation of the project</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Social and Ethical Acceptability:</strong> This project involves human research and AI applications, but we place a high value on ethical norms. All clinical subjects will sign informed consent, data will be kept strictly confidential, and the digital intervention protocol will follow medical norms and will not directly replace medical orders. The AI system is intended only as an aid, and its recommendations are reviewed by a doctor. We have received expert guidance on ethical design to ensure that the research process is ethical. As the project aims to improve the management of chronic diseases and benefit patients, the social benefits are clear, and the adoption of digital means is in line with the development direction of Wisdom Healthcare, it is expected to be understood and supported by the patient community and medical institutions. We will also establish feedback channels, listen to patients' opinions on the system, and continuously optimize to provide truly humane services. These measures provide a good basis for sustainable development of the project.</p>\n<p>In summary, the project has a high degree of feasibility in terms of team, foundation, technology, conditions and ethics. Although the research content is extensive, it is guaranteed by solid multidisciplinary collaboration and previous results. With the unique strengths of the applicant team in the field of artificial intelligence and medicine in DIKWP and the strong support of our collaborators, we are confident that we will complete all research tasks as planned and achieve the expected goals.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Phased-achievements-and-assessment-indicators\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Phased-achievements-and-assessment-indicators\" title=\"Phased achievements and assessment indicators\"></a><strong>Phased achievements and assessment indicators</strong></h1><p>In order to ensure the smooth progress of the project and the output of the results, a phased plan and quantitative assessment indicators are formulated as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 (initial project, 1-12 months): Model construction and mechanism explorationMain</strong><br/><em>tasks:</em> Complete the construction and preliminary verification of the brain-body interaction DIKWP bidirectional model;

Elucidate new insights into the brain-body regulation mechanism of chronic diseases (results written in guidelines or cited by others); The developed artificial awareness intervention system has been tested and is ready for further replication (with positive regulatory or market feedback). In addition, the project has produced no less than 5 high-quality papers (3-4 SCI papers), more than 5 intellectual property rights such as patents and soft works, and a number of talent training. Achieving these targets will indicate that the project has met or even exceeded its mandate, and has achieved fruitful results in both science and application.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Convert-app-paths-and-campaigns\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Convert-app-paths-and-campaigns\" title=\"Convert app paths and campaigns\"></a><strong>Convert app paths and campaigns</strong></h1><p>This project has a clear application orientation, and its research results will be transformed and promoted through multiple ways to benefit more patients with chronic diseases and serve the national health strategy:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Theoretical model and scientific cognition: The</strong> brain-body interaction DIKWP model and the cognitive-metabolic-immune three-dimensional model proposed by the project will be disseminated in the academic community as new theoretical tools. We plan to publish a monograph or chapter in the later stage of the project to systematically introduce the theoretical framework for reference by researchers in related fields. A new paradigm of \"brain-body interaction\" should be introduced in medical education and continuing education to improve clinicians' attention to the interaction mechanism between body and mind. For example, the evidence found in this project can be added to textbooks or guidelines such as endocrinology and psychosomatic medicine, and it is recommended that patients with chronic diseases should be evaluated and managed at the psychological purpose level. Through academic reports, seminars and other forms, the concept of physical and mental integration of chronic disease management was promoted to medical workers and the concept change was promoted. This will help promote the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases in China from simple organic treatment to comprehensive physical and mental intervention, and improve the overall efficacy.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Industrialization and application of digital intervention system: The</strong> artificial consciousness-driven intervention system developed by the project has significant application prospects. We will accelerate the industrialization process of the project after it is completed. Specific plans include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Partnering with companies in the digital health space to refine system functionality to meet medical product specifications and conduct large-scale testing. Consider setting up a startup team or company to upgrade a research prototype into a commercial digital therapeutics product.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Apply for approval of the digital therapeutics from the NMPA (if the relevant regulatory system is in place) or as a Class II medical device. After obtaining legal qualifications, it can be formally promoted and used in clinical practice.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A number of large hospitals or chronic disease management centers were selected for demonstration application. With technical support from the project team, the system was deployed at these pilot facilities to assist in the management of patients with chronic diseases who were followed up. Collect real-world results and feedback to further improve and establish success stories.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>With the help of the government's hierarchical diagnosis and treatment and family doctor service network, the system will be gradually extended to the grassroots level of the community. It is used by community doctors and patients in the form of SaaS services to realize remote management support for tens of thousands of patients with chronic diseases. Especially at the grassroots level, where doctors are understaffed, digital intervention systems can act as \"assistants\" to improve service coverage.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Explore cooperation models with commercial insurance and medical insurance institutions. If the system can effectively improve the health of patients, consider including the cost of its services in the insurance payment to motivate patients to participate. At the same time, it is also a kind of system business model, a guarantee of sustainable operation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Through the above measures, we strive to make the system occupy a place in the domestic chronic disease management market and serve millions of patients within 3-5 years after the end of the project. In the long run, if the effect is outstanding, it can also be promoted to the international market, participate in the global digital health industry competition, and strive for a leading position in the field of digital health for China.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Policy and standard impact:</strong> The research of this project is in line with the country's major strategic needs for chronic disease prevention and control and Wisdom Healthcare, and its results are expected to have an impact on relevant policy formulation and industry standards. At the end of the project, we will submit a report on policy recommendations to the National Health Commission and the competent departments of science and technology, including: promoting the integrated physical and mental management model of chronic diseases, supporting the integration of digital therapeutics into the formal healthcare system, and strengthening the supervision and guidance of the application of artificial intelligence in the medical field. Relevant data show that the premature mortality rate of chronic diseases in China has decreased, but the burden of chronic diseases is still heavy, and new strategies are needed. Our recommendations will provide a reference for the Healthy China Initiative. On the other hand, our digital intervention system, if successfully applied, can contribute to the development of guidelines and standards for digital health interventions. We will participate in standard discussions organized by industry associations, share our safety and efficacy evaluation methods, and promote the establishment of evaluation norms for digital therapeutics. In terms of AI ethics, we will also summarize our experience for policymakers to improve the ethical guidelines for AI healthcare. In this way, we ensure that the results of the project are valued at a broader level.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Continuous R&amp;D and talent training:</strong> The completion of the project is not the end, we will continue to deepen relevant research and maintain technological leadership. On the one hand, using the data and models generated by the project, apply for follow-up scientific research projects (such as the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Ministry of Science and Technology) to explore more scientific problems (such as the application of artificial consciousness in other diseases, the combination of brain-computer interface, etc.). On the other hand, the interdisciplinary talents cultivated by the project will become a valuable asset. These scientific research backbones who understand both medicine and AI can play an important role in universities and enterprises in the future, driving more cross-innovation. On the basis of the project, we plan to establish a joint laboratory for intelligent intervention for common chronic diseases, as a long-term platform for continuous R&amp;D and incubation results, and realize the rolling development of talents and technologies.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Social Publicity and Public Health Awareness Enhancement:</strong> Using the influence of the project, we will also carry out science popularization and publicity to raise the public's awareness of the physical and mental management of chronic diseases. For example, we will produce popular books or new media popular science articles to introduce how to assist in the recovery of chronic diseases by regulating emotions and strengthening will, and promote simple physical and mental adjustment methods. Organize patient lectures or public welfare activities to teach patients with chronic diseases to use digital tools to self-manage, and establish a positive attitude of \"my health is my decision\". Expand social influence through official media on the progress and effectiveness of the project (e.g., Science and Technology Daily, Health News, etc.). These efforts have helped to improve public health literacy and create a climate for the large-scale application of the project's results.</p>\n<p>To sum up, this project has planned a clear transformation path from theory to application. Relying on the strategy of simultaneous development of scientific research and industry, and interaction between policy and market, we are confident that the project results will go out of the laboratory, to the clinic, and into the society. It is expected that within a few years after the end of the project, China will be among the top in the world in the research on the brain-body interaction mechanism of chronic diseases and the practice of artificial intelligence intervention, and related technologies and products will benefit the majority of patients and produce significant health and economic benefits. The successful transformation of this project will become a national example of \"medical-engineering intersection\" scientific research, reflecting the strong supporting role of scientific and technological innovation in people's health.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

Background and significance of the project\"></a><strong>1. Background and significance of the project</strong></h1><h2 id=\"1-1-The-transformation-of-the-medical-model-is-in-line-with-the-national-strategy\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#1-1-The-transformation-of-the-medical-model-is-in-line-with-the-national-strategy\" title=\"1.1 The transformation of the medical model is in line with the national strategy\"></a><strong>1.1 The transformation of the medical model is in line with the national strategy</strong></h2><p>Today's medicine is undergoing a transition from the traditional \"passive medicine\" model to the new paradigm of \"active health/active medicine\". Traditional passive medicine (disease-centric) has promoted the rapid development of acute disease diagnosis and treatment technology in the past century, but it faces many challenges in the context of chronic disease epidemic and aging population. China has put forward the national strategy of transforming from \"disease treatment as the center\" to \"people's health as the center\", and the \"Healthy China 2030\" Planning Outline There is a clear call for a shift in the medical model from reactive treatment to active prevention. **As a result, the concept of active health has emerged, emphasizing that the individual is the first person responsible for health, and through daily self-monitoring, lifestyle intervention, and early screening and early intervention, \"**prevention before disease\" is realized. Active health, as a useful supplement to passive medical care, has enhanced the awareness of preventive health care among the whole people, and has achieved remarkable results in reducing the burden on hospitals and delaying the occurrence of diseases. However, the active health model driven by individuals and market forces alone lacks unified standards and institutional support, and it is difficult to comprehensively reverse the situation of \"emphasizing treatment over prevention\". To this end, it is necessary to upgrade the medical paradigm as a whole at a higher level, which is exactly the direction advocated by active medicine.</p>\n<p>As a revolutionary change to the medical model, active medicine provides a holistic view of medicine at the philosophical and institutional levels. Active medicine retains the technical advantages of passive medicine in professional diagnosis and treatment, absorbs the flexible mechanism of active health in daily prevention, and integrates more macro institutional design and value concepts, shapes \"disease-free\" as the ideal health benchmark, and promotes medical practice from simple treatment to focus on the harmonious coexistence of man, nature and society. This paradigm shift is in line with the country's strategic requirement of \"people's health as the center\", and shifts the focus of medical care to the health maintenance of the whole population and the whole life cycle. The \"Healthy China Action (2019-2030)\" proposes to move the threshold forward, put prevention first, and strive to make the masses not sick and less sick, which is the only way to achieve high health performance at a lower cost. Active medicine is a theoretical sublimation of this strategy: it emphasizes active monitoring and intervention at all stages of the life cycle to achieve continuous health maintenance from genetics, fetal period to old age. In terms of value orientation, active medicine advocates a higher goal of \"centering on harmony between man and nature\", rather than just eliminating the symptoms of disease. This concept coincides with the traditional Chinese medicine idea of \"curing diseases before they occur\" and the philosophy of \"harmony between man and nature\", and also coincides with the modern medicine to preventive medicine and whole health (One HealthThe international trend of transformation coincides.</p>\n<p>From a national strategic point of view, the proactive medicine paradigm is proposed. On the one hand, China's aging population and the heavy burden of chronic diseases have made it difficult for traditional medical models to cope with the growing demand for health services. <strong>Healthy aging has risen to a national strategy, the</strong> \"14th Five-Year Plan\".The plan emphasizes the promotion of the integration of medical treatment and prevention and the integration of medical care and elderly care, and requires a shift from disease treatment as the center to health maintenance as the center of the service model. Active medicine provides a paradigm support for the Healthy China strategy by strengthening prevention in the system and integrating the advantages of traditional Chinese and Western medicine in technology. On the other hand, the rapid development of a new generation of artificial intelligence also provides a technical opportunity for the implementation of active medicine. Active medicine emphasizes multidisciplinary collaboration and institutional innovation, and needs to use artificial intelligence, big data and other technical means to achieve dynamic monitoring of personal health status and intervention and decision-making support. This is highly consistent with the development direction of China's vigorous promotion of digital health and Wisdom medical care. The Ministry of Science and Technology's \"Active Health and Aging Science and Technology Response\" key project is to deploy scientific research forces around these needs, focus on the demonstration and application of key technologies for active health, build a new health perception, identification, intervention and management technology system, and promote the establishment of an integrated service model for elderly care, rehabilitation, nursing and medical care. This project has theoretically been upgraded from active health to active medicine, which is in line with the requirements of the national strategic transformation and will provide forward-looking guidance for deepening the construction of a healthy China.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-2-Artificial-intelligence-development-trends-and-opportunities-for-active-medicine\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#1-2-Artificial-intelligence-development-trends-and-opportunities-for-active-medicine\" title=\"1.2 Artificial intelligence development trends and opportunities for active medicine\"></a><strong>1.2 Artificial intelligence development trends and opportunities for active medicine</strong></h2><p>In the 20s of the 21st century, there is a new trend in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) from \"perceptual intelligence\" to \"cognitive intelligence\". AI systems represented by large-scale pre-trained models have unprecedented language understanding and knowledge reasoning capabilities, but they also expose problems such as \"black box\" decision-making, opacity and uncontrollability. To this end, AI research is evolving in the direction of \"intelligent self-knowledge\", that is, to enable AI to have the ability to reflect and explain its own cognitive processes, and to achieve explainable and controllable intelligence at a higher level. This trend brings important opportunities for the realization of active medicine: active medicine needs the support of \"active AI\", that is, artificial intelligence with autonomous purpose and transparent decision-making, in order to truly assume the role of active monitoring and intervention.</p>\n<p>\"Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom–Purpose (DIKWP)\" proposed by Prof. Yucong Duan's team The AI cognitive model provides a key theoretical basis for this AI paradigm change. The DIKWP model adds the highest level of \"Purpose/Purpose\" on the basis of the classic DIKW (pyramid model) to form a five-layer network cognitive structure of data, information, knowledge, Wisdom, and Purpose. It realizes the full-link traceability of AI from perception to decision-making. This innovative model is considered to be the underlying path to solve the current \"black box\" problem of large models, laying the foundation for the realization of AI with autonomous awareness. As Professor Yucong Duan noted, \"The DIKWP model builds a common cognitive language between humans and machines, allowing every step of the AI decision-making process to be traced, explained, and understood by humans. By embedding the critical layer of 'purpose' inside the model, we are not only making AI smarter, but also ensuring that it remains in service of human values and security needs.\" \"This kind of design, which integrates human purpose into AI cognition, transforms AI from a tool that passively executes instructions to an active AI subject that can actively understand the target, actively obtain information, and take action.</p>\n<p>The concept of \"active AI\" is a natural fit with the paradigm of active medicine. While traditional AI is mostly a passive response model, waiting for human input and then outputting results, active AI seeks to give AI a certain degree of autonomy: it can actively perceive the environment, collect the required data, reason about the hidden information, and intervene when necessary, driven by internal purposes. This coincides with the requirement of \"active intervention\" in active medicine. With the help of the DIKWP model and its derived artificial consciousness white-box evaluation system, we can ensure that active AI has the ability to have different cognitive levels and present the decision-making logic in a transparent way. For example, the DIKWP white-box evaluation standard led by the World Artificial Awareness Association has taken the lead in building a full-link evaluation system from data perception, knowledge reasoning to purpose recognition, which is used to quantify the \"consciousness level\" of large models 。 This evaluation system shows that by allowing AI to show each cognitive step and accept multi-dimensional assessments, the cognitive decision-making process of AI can be comprehensively analyzed, thereby setting a new benchmark for AI explainability. This project will make full use of these cutting-edge AI theoretical achievements, take the DIKWP model as the core framework, introduce the artificial consciousness white-box evaluation mechanism, and create an \"explainable, controllable, and autonomous purpose\" active AI system for the health management of middle-aged and elderly groups. This not only responds to the country's development requirements for a new generation of AI to be \"safe and controllable\", but also provides a path for active medicine: that is, through artificial intelligence empowerment, intelligent perception, semantic understanding and active intervention of individual health status.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-3-The-urgent-need-for-health-management-of-middle-aged-and-elderly-people\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#1-3-The-urgent-need-for-health-management-of-middle-aged-and-elderly-people\" title=\"1.3 The urgent need for health management of middle-aged and elderly people\"></a><strong>1.3 The urgent need for health management of middle-aged and elderly people</strong></h2><p>China has entered a deeply aging society, and the health problems of middle-aged and elderly people are becoming increasingly prominent. Chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are highly prevalent among the elderly, and the coexistence of multiple diseases among the elderly is common, putting medical resources under great pressure. The traditional medical model mainly treats the diseases that have occurred in the hospital environment, and it is difficult to cover the daily health management of the community and home scenarios in a timely manner. Due to the lack of active health monitoring and intervention, many elderly people often miss the opportunity for early intervention of diseases. In addition, problems such as cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease are also growing rapidly, causing a heavy burden on individuals, families and society. At the national level, the goal of \"healthy aging\" is proposed, emphasizing the need to integrate health into the whole process of elderly life, strengthen preventive health care, and develop community and home-based medical care services. However, the current digital health management services for middle-aged and elderly groups are still imperfect, and there are the following pain points:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>l <strong>Fragmentation of health data and lack of continuous monitoring: The</strong> medical data of the elderly are scattered in hospitals at all levels, and the health data in daily life (such as exercise, sleep, blood pressure, blood sugar, etc.) lacks systematic collection, making it difficult to detect health risks in time. It is necessary to establish a health record and continuous monitoring mechanism for the whole life cycle of individuals to realize the dynamic assessment and early warning of the health status of the elderly.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Disconnect between prevention and intervention:</strong> At present, primary medical institutions and community health services are weak in early disease screening and health education, and elderly care services and medical services have not been effectively connected. When the elderly have sub-health signals (such as vision loss, memory loss) at home, there is often no timely professional intervention. There is an urgent need for an intelligent system that can give intervention suggestions at an early stage, and integrate medical, health care, and health care resources to actively serve the elderly.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Insufficient integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine resources:</strong> Chinese medicine has rich experience in health care and chronic disease management, but in the health management of the elderly, traditional Chinese medicine interventions (such as dietary therapy, acupuncture, exercises, etc.) and Western medicine methods (drugs, surgery, rehabilitation training, etc.) are often separated, and it is difficult for the elderly to obtain comprehensive solutions. How to integrate the advantages of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine to provide personalized and multi-dimensional health interventions for the elderly is a major challenge.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Insufficient intelligence and age-appropriateness: The</strong> elderly have limited acceptance of high-tech products, and the current popularity of wearable devices and health apps among the elderly is low, and the design for the elderly is insufficient. It is necessary to develop more non-inductive and convenient ubiquitous health monitoring technologies (such as non-invasive sensing, smart home embedded devices, etc.), as well as interactive means close to the use habits of the elderly (such as voice assistants, large-character displays, etc.) to reduce the digital divide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In view of the above needs, this project is of great practical significance to introduce the active medicine paradigm into this field based on digital health management and intervention services for middle-aged and elderly people. On the one hand, it can significantly improve the health level and quality of life of the elderly: through continuous health monitoring and early intervention, it can prevent diseases before they occur, replace \"treatment of existing diseases\" with \"treatment of existing diseases\", and help the elderly delay functional decline and reduce the occurrence of disability and dementia. This will reduce the burden on families and medical insurance, in line with Healthy China's goal of \"increasing healthy life expectancy\". On the other hand, this project will explore the active health service model of the integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and give full play to the \"preventive treatment\" of traditional Chinese medicine The synergy with the precision diagnosis and treatment of Western medicine creates a new paradigm of elderly health management. This also has exemplary value for improving China's elderly health service system and cultivating a new health industry. In general, the project closely follows the national strategic needs and the frontier of technological development, and is of great significance in theory and practice: it not only promotes the medical model from passive to active, from fragmentation to integration, but also promotes the in-depth application of artificial intelligence in the field of people's livelihood and health, providing a replicable and promotable model for the construction of an \"active and healthy society\".</p>\n<h1 id=\"2-Project-objectives-and-research-content\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-Project-objectives-and-research-content\" title=\"2.

The overall goal is to build a digital health service system that integrates traditional Chinese and Western medicine knowledge, has cognitive intelligence and active intervention capabilities, realizes continuous monitoring, semantic understanding and active intervention of the health status of middle-aged and elderly people, and provides technical support and demonstration models for healthy aging.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the overall objectives of the project can be broken down into the following points:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>l <strong>Paradigm innovation goal:</strong> A new paradigm of \"active medicine\" health service is proposed at a theoretical level, and based on the DIKWP model, the medical model is upgraded from passive diagnosis and treatment to a comprehensive system of active perception, active prevention and active intervention, which meets the needs of the national health strategy. Through the practice of this project, the theoretical connotation and technical framework of active medicine will be improved, and the medical paradigm change will be led.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Technology R&amp;D objectives:</strong> Develop an active medical intelligence semantic fusion system, including a knowledge graph of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine, a cognitive agent for artificial awareness white-box evaluation, an active intervention decision-making engine, and a user-oriented digital health management platform. Realize the intelligence of the whole process of cross-modal health data collection, semantic analysis, risk assessment, and intervention plan generation, and ensure that the system decision-making is explainable, traceable, safe and controllable.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Application demonstration objectives:</strong> Deploy demonstration applications in typical scenarios such as urban communities and rural elderly care to verify common health problems in middle-aged and elderly people (such as cataract screening, fall prevention warning, cognitive impairment intervention, etc.). Form quantifiable health improvement effects and service model experience, formulate relevant standards and specifications, and promote the promotion and application of the results on a larger scale.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Industry-driven goal:</strong> Cultivate a new form of active health service with multidisciplinary integration, and promote the integrated development of artificial intelligence and the medical and health industry. Through the implementation of the project, a number of core technologies and products with independent intellectual property rights (such as intelligent monitoring equipment, knowledge graph platform, health intervention app, etc.) will be produced, and the formulation of standards and the establishment of industrial alliances will be promoted, so as to provide momentum for the upgrading of China's health technology industry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"2-2-Main-research-contents\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-2-Main-research-contents\" title=\"2.2 Main research contents\"></a><strong>2.2 Main research contents</strong></h2><p>In order to achieve the above objectives, the project has developed the following main research contents and task modules:</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-2-1-Architecture-design-of-active-medical-intelligence-semantic-fusion-system\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-2-1-Architecture-design-of-active-medical-intelligence-semantic-fusion-system\" title=\"2.2.1 Architecture design of active medical intelligence semantic fusion system\"></a><strong>2.2.1 Architecture design of active medical intelligence semantic fusion system</strong></h3><p>Construct the overall project architecture and develop a technical roadmap. The architecture of this system is based on the DIKWP model proposed by Professor Yucong Duan as the core soul, and is composed of five functional modules of the cognitive layer: data layer, information layer, knowledge layer, Wisdom layer and Purpose layer, supplemented by cognitive cycle and metacognitive control mechanism, to realize the independent cognition and regulation of health status by AI. The specific design includes: the <strong>perception layer is responsible for the collection and processing of ubiquitous health data, the semantic layer is responsible for the semantic labeling and integration of multi-source data, the cognitive layer carries the knowledge reasoning and scenario understanding of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, the decision-making layer conducts comprehensive evaluation and intervention plan generation, and the purpose layer sets the overall goals of the system and monitors the output and feedback of each layer. Through five-layer collaboration and two-way feedback,</strong> a circular closed loop of \"data→ information→ knowledge→ Wisdom→Purpose\" is formed, so that the system has the ability of continuous learning and self-optimization. The architecture design also includes secure rights management and privacy protection solutions to ensure that personal health data is collected, transmitted, stored, and used in compliance with ethical norms and security standards.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-2-2-Knowledge-graph-construction-and-semantic-integration-of-traditional-Chinese-and-Western-medicine\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-2-2-Knowledge-graph-construction-and-semantic-integration-of-traditional-Chinese-and-Western-medicine\" title=\"2.2.2 Knowledge graph construction and semantic integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine\"></a><strong>2.2.2 Knowledge graph construction and semantic integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine</strong></h3><p>Constructing a health semantic network that integrates the knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine is the basis for realizing intelligent semantic understanding. The research contents include: 1) <strong>TCM knowledge graph construction: collect and sort out the knowledge in TCM classics and clinical guidelines, such as TCM theoretical system (viscera, meridians, yin and yang five elements, etc.), TCM syndromes and symptoms, TCM and prescriptions, acupuncture and moxibustion health care, etc., and formalize it into knowledge graph nodes and relationships.</strong> 2) <strong>Construction of Western medicine knowledge graph: Construct a standardized Western medicine knowledge graph by using the existing medical knowledge base (such as disease diagnosis, anatomy, physiology, biochemical indicators, western medicine and surgery, etc.) and geriatric medicine guidelines.</strong> 3) Semantic mapping and ontology integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine: study the correspondence between the conceptual system of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and establish cross-system ontology mapping rules. For example, the \"syndrome\" of traditional Chinese medicine is associated with the \"disease/syndrome\" of Western medicine, the mechanism of action of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine is corresponded, and the meridian effect of acupuncture and moxibustion is correlated with the function of the nervous system. Through semantic bridging, a unified health knowledge representation model is formed. 4) Knowledge graph fusion algorithm: develop a semantic fusion algorithm, based on the method of DIKWP semantic mathematics, to realize the association reasoning and consistency maintenance of traditional Chinese and Western medicine knowledge at the knowledge layer. Semantic mathematics is used to formally constrain knowledge, so that the fused knowledge graph remains rigorous and reliable in terms of conceptual level and logical reasoning. 5) Knowledge update and evolution: Design a dynamic update mechanism of knowledge graph, and continuously feed new medical evidence and project clinical data back to the knowledge base through machine learning and expert verification to ensure the timeliness and applicability of knowledge.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-2-3-Research-and-development-of-cognitive-agents-and-active-intervention-mechanisms\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-2-3-Research-and-development-of-cognitive-agents-and-active-intervention-mechanisms\" title=\"2.2.3 Research and development of cognitive agents and active intervention mechanisms\"></a><strong>2.2.3 Research and development of cognitive agents and active intervention mechanisms</strong></h3><p>On the basis of the knowledge graph, the research and development of AI agents with human-like cognition and initiative is the core technology of the project. Main research contents: 1) Integration of artificial consciousness white-box evaluation system: The DIKWP artificial consciousness white-box evaluation standard is applied to the development of the AI model of this project, and the ability performance of the agent at all levels of data perception, information extraction, knowledge reasoning, wisdom decision-making, and purpose guidance is tracked and evaluated throughout the process. Through white-box design, the model outputs intermediate semantic explanations (such as \"link inference\" and \"purpose analysis\" steps) during the inference process, so that developers and medical experts can understand the basis of model decision-making. 2) Cognitive reasoning engine: Develop a cognitive reasoning algorithm based on semantic mathematics to map the collected multi-source health data (physiological indicators, behavioral data, environmental data, etc.) to the semantic space for inference. For example, through formal rules, it is inferred that \"an elderly person has recently had unstable gait + eye discomfort + TCM 'liver and kidney deficiency' syndrome = increased risk of cataracts\", or\"Decreased sleep quality + mild memory loss = early signs of Alzheimer's disease\". Semantic mathematics ensures that the reasoning process remains semantically consistent and reduces logical bias. 3) Active decision-making and purpose regulation: realize the ability of agents to make active decisions according to health goals. With the help of the Purpose layer of the DIKWP model, the overall goal of the system service is set to \"maintain and improve personal health and delay the decline\". Based on this, the agent evaluates the contribution of various intervention programs to the goal and selects the optimal plan for implementation. For example, for the detected risk, the agent can consider the user's preference and effect to decide whether to recommend TCM conditioning (diet/acupuncture) or Western medical visit/medication intervention, or a combination of both. The Purpose layer also enables the agent to be self-driven: when data is missing or inconsistent, it can proactively obtain more information (such as prompting the user to make additional measurements or ask questions); When the intervention effect is not good, the strategy should be actively adjusted to form a closed-loop management. 4) <strong>Human-computer interaction and feedback learning: Design natural human-computer interaction interfaces (voice assistants, home companion robots, etc.) so that the agent can provide suggestions and explanations in a way that is easy for the elderly to accept, and at the same time obtain user feedback. Through reinforcement learning, feedback signals are used to optimize model parameters to realize personalized learning of</strong> individuals by agents, and the more they use it, the more they \"understand\" the user. Focus on ethics and safety in the interaction process to ensure that the agent's recommendations are always supervised by humans and can be discontinued or modified.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-2-4-Digital-health-management-platform-and-application-demonstration\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-2-4-Digital-health-management-platform-and-application-demonstration\" title=\"2.2.4 Digital health management platform and application demonstration\"></a><strong>2.2.4 Digital health management platform and application demonstration</strong></h3><p>Develop a digital platform for end users and service providers to integrate and put these technologies into practice. Research contents: 1) <strong>Ubiquitous health monitoring network: build an Internet of Things health monitoring network covering homes, communities, and medical institutions. Deploy smart terminals (such as wearable bracelets, mattress sensors, smart pill boxes, environmental sensors, etc.) in elderly homes, configure health all-in-one machines, fundus screening devices and other equipment in community elderly care centers, and access 5G communication to achieve seamless monitoring near human space. Develop health data standards and interface specifications (such as personal health passport data specifications) to ensure compatibility and integration of data from different devices. 2) Active health management app/applet: Develop age-friendly mobile apps to provide the elderly and their family members with functions such as health status browsing, early warning reminders, and intervention guidance. The app interconnects with the agent's backend to push reminders when risks are detected (e.g., \"recent weight loss + poor appetite, it is recommended to strengthen nutrition\"), provide explanations supported by knowledge graphs, and give suggestions for actions (such as dietary adjustments, TCM health care methods, or hospital visit guidelines). At the same time, it provides health education content and online consulting services to improve users' health literacy. 3) Doctor and nursing support system: develop a management platform for community doctors, family nurses and other professionals. Functions include viewing the health risk ranking of the elderly under its jurisdiction, receiving abnormal alerts pushed by AI, reviewing AI-recommended intervention plans and deciding whether to adopt them, remote guidance, etc. The platform integrates electronic health records and knowledge graphs to assist doctors in making global decisions. Realize two-way collaboration between medical staff and AI: AI actively screens risks, provides decision-making references, and doctors review and check, execute interventions, and feedback results for model improvement. 4) Application demonstration and evaluation: select representative pilot areas to carry out application demonstration. For example, an active health management demonstration station was established in urban communities, and a certain number of middle-aged and elderly residents were recruited to use the system, which was observed for six months to one year, and the evaluation indicators included: health behavior improvement rate, chronic disease control rate, change in acute hospitalization rate, user satisfaction, etc. Another example is in remote rural areas, where remote monitoring services are provided for the left-behind elderly through simplified equipment to assess the suitability of the system in a low-resource environment. For the two typical scenarios of cataract and Alzheimer's disease, a special intervention process was developed and the effect was verified (see Chapter 4 for details). Finally, the new model and technical specifications of digital health continuous service are extracted, and a complete application demonstration report and promotion strategy are formed.</strong></p>\n<p>To sum up, the research content of the project covers the whole chain of theoretical methods, key technologies and application demonstrations, including top-level architecture design, specific technical module research, and practical scenario verification. The modules are closely connected: knowledge graphs and semantic algorithms provide intelligent \"knowledge brains\", cognitive agents endow the system with \"active thinking and decision-making\" capabilities, and digital platforms transform technological achievements into service capabilities. Through phased implementation and integrated testing, a fully functional active medical digital health service system will be finally realized, providing a new health security paradigm for the middle-aged and elderly population in China.</p>\n<h1 id=\"3-Technical-route-and-innovation-points\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-Technical-route-and-innovation-points\" title=\"3. Technical route and innovation points\"></a><strong>3. Technical route and innovation points</strong></h1><h2 id=\"3-1-Technical-roadmap\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-1-Technical-roadmap\" title=\"3.1 Technical roadmap\"></a><strong>3.1 Technical roadmap</strong></h2><p>The technical route of this project follows the path of \"theoretical guidance-technical research-integrated application\", and adopts the method of iterative development and verification to gradually achieve the system goal. The overall technical roadmap is shown in the figure (the project technical roadmap can be inserted here if necessary), and is mainly divided into the following parallel and cross-interactive routes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Route 1: Build a DIKWP intelligent semantic framework. Based on the DIKWP model, a systematic semantic cognitive framework is first constructed. This includes defining the five-layer cognitive function modules and their interfaces, and establishing the mapping mechanism of the four cognitive spaces (conceptual space, cognitive space, semantic space, and consciousness space). Through simulation, it is verified that each layer module can produce logical explanations and responses to simple health cases (such as fluctuations in a single indicator). Ensure that the framework design is reasonable, and provide standards for the subsequent development of each technical module.</p>\n<p>Route 2: Multi-source health data collection and processing. Develop various data acquisition methods and pre-processing algorithms required for the project. Including the selection and deployment of wearable monitoring devices, the construction of home sensor networks, and the development of data interfaces for medical information systems. Develop data cleaning and feature extraction processes for different data sources, and transform raw data into structured information into the data layer of the DIKWP framework. At the same time, a master index of personal health is established, and scattered data is aggregated by user to form a \"personal health digital portrait\".</p>\n<p>Route 3: Knowledge Graph and Semantic Reasoning R&amp;D. In parallel, the construction of knowledge graph of traditional Chinese and Western medicine was promoted, and the semi-automatic method (NLP text extraction + expert verification) was used to complete the initial graph. Then, based on the theory of semantic mathematics, a knowledge fusion and reasoning engine is developed to realize the semantic interpretation of personal health data at the information layer and the knowledge layer. This route requires constant interaction with route two: data processing provides new health facts, and the knowledge engine performs inference validation, which in turn guides data collection (e.g., if a new indicator is needed to be monitored).</p>\n<p>Route 4: Cognitive agent development and evaluation. With knowledge graph and semantic reasoning as the \"center\", the active AI agent is developed. Modular design: perception module, inference module, decision-making module and purpose management module. The artificial consciousness white-box evaluation method was introduced, a series of cognitive tasks were designed to test the agent's ability, and the model structure was iteratively optimized. At the same time, the agent is allowed to access real user data for trial operation in a small area to find problems (such as whether the decision is robust and whether the explanation is easy to understand), and then improve the algorithm. This route requires collaboration with Route 5 in terms of human-computer interaction.</p>\n<p>Route 5: Platform integration and application validation. Integrate the above results into the digital health management platform, including front-end apps, back-end databases, doctor-side interfaces, etc. Firstly, the interfaces of each module are jointly debugged in the experimental environment to ensure the smooth flow of data and decision-making. Subsequently, pilot users were selected to carry out a closed test: the platform pushed intervention suggestions, manually recorded feedback, and compared the changes in health indicators with or without AI intervention. Adjust platform functionality and interaction based on test results. For example, if it is found that elderly users are not very good at operating apps, add voice interaction or assistance from grassroots personnel. Finally, open application was carried out at the demonstration site, and actual effect data were collected for evaluation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the implementation process, the above routes are not isolated, but spirally intertwined: the improvement of the quality of the knowledge graph will enhance the accuracy of the agent's decision-making, and the new knowledge fed back by the agent will feed back to the knowledge base; The expanded scope of data collection has enabled more scenarios to be covered, and new requirements found in the application of the platform have driven improvements in sensing devices. Milestone node control will be adopted in project management, and each stage will enter the next stage after completing the milestone acceptance to ensure that the technical route is carried out as planned.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-2-Key-technological-innovations\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-2-Key-technological-innovations\" title=\"3.2 Key technological innovations\"></a><strong>3.2 Key technological innovations</strong></h2><p>This project integrates multidisciplinary cutting-edge theories and applied innovations, and is expected to achieve breakthroughs in the following key technologies:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(1) Innovation of semantic integration of active medicine: Breaking through the limitations of the existing health management based on a single system of Western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine, this paper proposes an active medical framework for the semantic integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Through DIKWP semantic mathematics, artificial intelligence is given a formal expression of concepts such as \"health\" and \"disease-free\", and the medical paradigm is upgraded at the philosophical level. This innovation elevates medical knowledge from the empirical layer to the semantic layer, and uses mathematical and computational language to uniformly represent the \"syndrome\" and \"treatment\" of traditional Chinese medicine and the \"disease\" and \"medicine\" of Western medicine to fill the gap that there is no deep integration model of traditional Chinese and Western medicine knowledge at home and abroad.</p>\n<p><strong>(2) DIKWP Artificial Awareness White-box Evaluation Application: For the first time, the latest DIKWP white-box evaluation method in the field of artificial intelligence is applied to the development of health service systems to build an interpretable cognitive health AI</strong>。 By dividing the AI decision-making process into five parts: data, information, knowledge, wisdom, and purpose, the whole process of the agent's decision-making mechanism can be traced, which greatly improves the credibility and security of the system. Compared with the traditional black-box medical AI model, this system can clearly understand the reasoning behind each health recommendation and establish a trust foundation for human-machine collaboration.</p>\n<p><strong>(3) Active AI autonomous intervention technology: A new implementation method of Active AI in the field of medical and health care is proposed. Traditional health management AI is mostly passive query or preset rule reminder by users, but this project uses purpose-driven cognitive agents to enable AI to have the ability to independently find problems and take action. This proactivity is reflected in the fact that</strong> AI no longer waits for users to ask questions, but continuously monitors the user's status and actively identifies potential health risks; AI is not limited to a single intervention, but can independently choose a combination of multiple interventions such as traditional Chinese medicine, lifestyle guidance or medical services. AI can also track the effectiveness of interventions after they have been executed, and automatically adjust the plan if necessary. This kind of self-purposeful AI application is the first of its kind in the field of health management in China, and will lead the transformation of \"from passive medical care to active health\".</p>\n<p><strong>(4) Knowledge graph and semantic reasoning of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine: develop medical knowledge graph technology across semantic space to realize unified reasoning of complex heterogeneous knowledge. These include: semantic extraction and alignment techniques for multi-source medical knowledge, fusion methods of fuzzy logic in traditional Chinese medicine and quantitative rules in western medicine, and hybrid reasoning engines that take into account probability and logic. The innovation lies in the introduction of the axiom of semantic consistency to ensure that the reasoning process does not deviate from the real clinical meaning. At the same time, the DIKWP hierarchical framework is used to divide reasoning into different spaces of concept, cognition, semantics, and consciousness for parallel processing, so as to improve the ability to solve complex problems of reasoning. These explorations will enrich the knowledge graph and methodology in the field of cognitive computing, and promote the evolution of medical artificial intelligence from purely data-driven to knowledge-driven.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(5) Ubiquitous health monitoring system for the elderly: At the application level, the ubiquitous health Internet of Things in the elderly care scenario is innovatively constructed</strong>. The project will integrate Wisdom building, smart home and wearable device technologies, and take the lead in creating a \"healthy building embedded healthcare\" solution in China. For example, we will integrate floor pressure sensing for fall monitoring, smart lighting for mood and sleep intervention, air quality sensing for environmental health assessment in nursing homes, etc., to develop a smart health environment suitable for home/nursing homes. All devices are interconnected with the AI platform in real time to realize the active health intervention of the environment-human-AI trinity. The innovation of the system lies in truly \"people sit at home, health comes from heaven\", and extend health care services to the daily life space of the elderly.</p>\n<p><strong>(6) Data standards and service model innovation: The project will develop personal health data normative standards</strong> (similar to health passport standards) and semantic interoperability standards to fill the gap in the field of active health standards. At the same time, we explore a new health supply model of \"model as a service\", and continuously provide multi-party collaborative services for individuals through third-party digital platforms. This model connects the service capabilities of different institutions (hospitals, pharmacies, health management companies, and elderly care institutions) through the platform, and AI matches and supplies them according to the model decision-making results, creating a new ecology of digital health services. This model of multi-party collaboration and on-demand supply is of innovative significance for solving the current problem of fragmentation and mismatch between supply and demand between medical and elderly care services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In summary, this project has significant innovations in theory, technology and application. Whether it is the improvement of the academic theory of the active medical paradigm, the implementation of artificial consciousness white-box technology in the field of health, and the various new technologies and new models of cross-border integration, they are all cutting-edge explorations. The successful implementation of the project is expected to form original achievements with independent intellectual property rights, and establish China's international leading position in the field of active health/active medicine.</p>\n<h1 id=\"4-Application-Scenarios\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-Application-Scenarios\" title=\"4. Application Scenarios\"></a><strong>4. Application Scenarios</strong></h1><p>The research results of this project will focus on the application of digital health management and intervention for middle-aged and elderly people, and select three types of scenarios for demonstration: community, home and rural areas. Among them, each scenario selects common and representative health problems of the elderly to simulate the service process under the paradigm of \"active medicine\" in the future. Typical application scenarios are described below:</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-1-Active-screening-and-intervention-scenarios-for-cataract-in-the-community\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-1-Active-screening-and-intervention-scenarios-for-cataract-in-the-community\" title=\"4.1 Active screening and intervention scenarios for cataract in the community\"></a><strong>4.1 Active screening and intervention scenarios for cataract in the community</strong></h2><p><strong>Scenario Overview:</strong> An urban community elderly care service center introduces an active health management system of this project to provide regular health monitoring and intervention services for elderly residents in the jurisdiction. Cataract is a common blinding eye disease in the elderly, and many elderly people in the traditional mode delay diagnosis and treatment due to lack of symptoms. With the support of the active medicine system, the community carried out active cataract screening and intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Participating Characters:</strong> Uncle Zhang, a 70-year-old man, retired at home; Dr Lee, a community general practitioner; AI health management assistant \"Xiaoyuan\" (the incarnation of the project's agent, which provides services through voice interaction devices).</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario flow:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>l <strong>Daily monitoring and risk detection:</strong> Uncle Zhang wears smart glasses-type devices every day, which can monitor his visual clarity, reading distance and other indicators; The TV set-top box at home is equipped with vision AI software to analyze his gaze and expression when watching TV. The system collects this data continuously and analyzes it weekly by the AI assistant \"Xiaoyuan\". In a certain month, AI found that Uncle Zhang's reading distance had become significantly closer recently, and he frequently squinted when watching TV, combined with the slow downward trend of his vision examination within half a year, it was judged that he had early signs of cataract and an increased risk score. The AI sent this information to Dr. Li through the community platform, and took the initiative to remind Uncle Zhang on the smart speaker at home: \"Recently, it has been detected that your visual difficulty may increase, and it is recommended to undergo cataract screening.\" After receiving the voice reminder, Uncle Zhang agreed to be arranged by the system.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Door-to-door screening and semantic analysis:</strong> The next day, the community health service station sent a mobile screening vehicle to Uncle Zhang's community. The screening vehicle is equipped with a portable digital slit lamp and fundus camera, and is connected to the AI platform. During the examination, the AI assistant guides Uncle Zhang to complete the eye chart test and eye photography, and uploads the data in real time. The AI first invokes the knowledge graph of Western medicine for image analysis to identify the degree of lens opacity. At the same time, combined with the knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine (such as asking Uncle Zhang if he has symptoms of dry eyes, liver and kidney insufficiency), the semantic judgment of the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine is carried out. The AI reasoning results showed: \"Very mild opacity behind the lens of the left eye, and the visual acuity decreased from 0.6 to 0.4, which is an early senile cataract, and traditional Chinese medicine belongs to the category of 'dizziness', and the possibility of liver and kidney deficiency is high.\" The system fed back the conclusions and evidence to Dr. Li and Uncle Zhang in the form of natural language and diagrams. After Dr. Li verified the AI analysis, he confirmed that Uncle Zhang had early cataracts.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Active intervention plan formulation:</strong> In response to this situation, the AI assistant generates a personalized comprehensive intervention plan in the background: in Western medicine, it is recommended to undergo elective surgery within six months and use nutritional lens drugs before surgery to slow down the progression; In terms of traditional Chinese medicine, it is recommended to carry out eye exercises and acupressure every day (focusing on pressing the eyes, temples, etc.), and oral Chinese medicine Mingmu decoction to regulate the liver and kidneys; In terms of daily life, it is recommended to wear UV protection glasses outdoors and increase the intake of foods rich in vitamin A. The AI informed Uncle Zhang of the key points of the plan through the voice of \"Xiao Yuan\", and explained: \"Your cataract is still very early, and it is expected to delay the development through the intervention of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine. We recommend ......(specific scheme)\". At the same time, the plan was pushed to Dr. Li, and after being approved by Dr. Li, it was entered into the system as a formal health intervention plan.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Intervention execution and tracking:</strong> In the following months, the AI assistant \"Xiao Yuan\" reminded Uncle Zhang to drop eye drops according to the doctor's instructions, instructed him to perform eye acupressure massage, and pushed weekly recipe suggestions (such as carrot scrambled eggs and other eye-friendly foods). Uncle Zhang feedback \"completed\" after each execution or the family members record the completion on the App, and the system tracks compliance accordingly. If Uncle Zhang forgets it one day, the system will patiently remind him; If it is not completed many times, the community doctor will be notified for follow-up care. Three months later, the AI arranged a re-examination of visual acuity and updated the risk assessment, and found that the visual acuity was basically stable at 0.4, and the intervention was initially effective. At this time, the AI offered to postpone the surgery plan appropriately and continue to observe. At the same time, the system will send the phased results to the WeChat of Uncle Zhang's children, so that the family can understand the health status of the elderly.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Multi-party linkage and dynamic adjustment:</strong> During the continuous service process, community doctors regularly review the AI white-box evaluation report, which details what conclusions the system has drawn based on what data and knowledge. For example, the report shows that \"this month, the probability of cataract determination based on a 0.1 decrease in visual acuity, a 20-centimeter reduction in reading distance, and a 10% increase in the probability of cataract judgment based on knowledge base rule R45\" enables doctors to fully grasp the AI logic. If Dr. Li finds that Uncle Zhang has other eye diseases (such as high risk of glaucoma), he can adjust the focus of intervention through the system, and the AI will quickly learn the doctor's new instructions and incorporate them into subsequent decision-making. In the whole process, community services, home care and AI assistants form a human-machine collaborative network - AI is responsible for continuous monitoring, intelligent analysis and active reminders, doctors are responsible for diagnosis and confirmation and key decision-making, and the elderly are responsible for cooperating actions and feedback feelings, and all links are closely connected. After a year of demonstration, Uncle Zhang's cataract has not progressed significantly, and his quality of life is good. At the community level, due to the active screening intervention, the incidence of cataract in the middle and late stages of the elderly in the jurisdiction was reduced, and unnecessary loss of function was avoided. This scene shows the value of the paradigm of active medicine in the prevention and treatment of blindness in the community: <strong>diseases are not treated until blindness is lost, but are caught and controlled at the beginning of the process</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"4-2-Home-Alzheimer-s-disease-intelligent-monitoring-and-intervention-scenarios\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-2-Home-Alzheimer-s-disease-intelligent-monitoring-and-intervention-scenarios\" title=\"4.2 Home Alzheimer's disease intelligent monitoring and intervention scenarios\"></a><strong>4.2 Home Alzheimer's disease intelligent monitoring and intervention scenarios</strong></h2><p><strong>Scene Overview:</strong> In the home of an empty nest elderly couple, their wife, Aunt Wang (68), has recently become forgetful. The project's intelligent health management system continues to serve them as a \"digital family doctor\". For elderly cognitive impairments such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), traditional passive medical care often waits until patients have obvious memory loss before starting intervention, missing the early window. Active medicine systems are expected to enable smart home monitoring, early identification, and cognitive intervention to slow down the disease process.</p>\n<p><strong>Roles:</strong> Aunt Wang, husband Uncle Li; AI cognitive health assistant \"Xiaozhi\"; Community GP/Psychiatrist.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario flow:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Daily behavior monitoring:</strong> Smart home sensors and voice assistant \"Xiaozhi\" are installed in Aunt Wang's home. The system observes her cognitive behavior every day in a multimodal way: for example, the kitchen sensor records her cooking steps, the smart medicine box records whether she takes her medication on time, the voice assistant chats with her from time to time, and the memory and calculation skills are assessed through dialogue. After a while, the AI noticed several anomalies: Aunt Wang forgot to take her high blood pressure medication twice in a week; The kettle was dry boiled several times, showing that she forgot to turn off the heat; During the conversation test with \"Ash\", she sometimes couldn't answer the previous day's activities. These fragmented signals were comprehensively analyzed through the knowledge graph: AI identified this red flag as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from Western medical knowledge, and corresponded to the \"forgetfulness (brain and kidney insufficiency)\" syndrome from the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine. The system derives a preliminary risk assessment: Aunt Wang may be in the early stage of AD. The AI then triggered the intervention process, notifying Uncle Li and his children to pay attention, and on the other hand, reporting the situation to the community doctor and recommending a professional cognitive assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>Professional assessment and diagnosis:</strong> After receiving the notification, the community doctor came to conduct a simple mental state examination (MMSE, etc.) for Aunt Wang, and the result score was slightly lower than normal. The doctor entered the examination results into the system, and the system, combined with the previous family monitoring data, characterized Aunt Wang's status as \"suspected MCI, possible early Alzheimer's disease\". Diagnosis by a psychiatrist and development of an intervention plan by a psychiatrist is recommended. Soon, under the coordination of the community, Aunt Wang went to the memory clinic for an MRI examination and neuropsychological evaluation, ruled out other causes, and was diagnosed with early AD.</p>\n<p><strong>Active intervention plan:</strong> The AI assistant \"Xiaozhi\" formulated a personalized cognitive intervention plan for Aunt Wang based on multidisciplinary knowledge: in terms of medicine, combined with the cholinesterase inhibitor prescribed by the doctor, the system reminds her to take the medicine on time; In traditional Chinese medicine, nootropic Chinese medicine prescriptions (such as gastrodia, calamus, etc.) are distributed by the community traditional Chinese medicine center, and they are decocted daily; In terms of cognitive training, the system arranges certain mental exercises (such as recall games, trivia quizzes) every day and chats with her; In terms of lifestyle, it is recommended to increase exercise (walking with you every night and counting steps), social activities (participating in community dance activities every week), etc. In particular, AI has designed a series of thoughtful measures to assist memory: for example, the smart screen combined with the refrigerator magnet lists the to-do items of the day every day, and repeatedly reminds important items with voice reminders; For Aunt Wang, who often forgets things, the AI provides an instant query function - she only needs to ask \"Ash, have I taken any medicine?\" The AI can answer based on the sensor recording. Through these measures, AI has played the role of \"digital caregiver\" and \"cognitive trainer\" to some extent.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-source feedback and dynamic adjustment:</strong> During the intervention, the system continued to collect feedback data from Aunt Wang in all aspects: the smart bracelet monitored whether her exercise volume met the standard; The voice assistant assesses whether her correct rate of answering questions has improved; Uncle Li can also report her daily memory status through the app. The AI summarizes the effect of the intervention once a month and reports to doctors and families: \"This month, Aunt Wang walked an average of 5,000 steps a day, an increase of 20% from the previous month; 95% compliance rate of drugs and traditional Chinese medicines; There was a slight improvement in cognitive test scores, and the overall trend of memory decline slowed. \"If some interventions are found to be not working well, the AI will suggest adjustments. For example, if the side effects of the drug are obvious, you can ask your doctor to adjust the dose; If she doesn't exercise enough, the AI will encourage her to go out more often or pair up with volunteers to accompany her to exercise.</p>\n<p><strong>Humanistic care and long-term companionship:</strong> In addition to technical interventions, the system pays great attention to humanistic care. AI \"Xiaozhi\" talks with Aunt Wang every day, chatting about the opera she is interested in or interesting stories about her children to relieve her emotions; Observe her expression through the camera, and if depression is detected, comfort and notify the family in time. As a caregiver, Uncle Li also received guidance through the system (such as how to deal with some of his wife's memory loss behaviors) and received respite service referrals in a timely manner to reduce his stress. In this way, the AI system not only coldly issues tasks, but also acts as a \"close friend\" in the lives of elderly couples and an assistant for home care.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Scene Effect:</strong> After systematic active intervention, Aunt Wang's cognitive function decline rate slowed down significantly, and she was still able to take care of her daily life basically after two years. Compared with no intervention, delaying the course of the disease buys valuable time for both the family and society. This scenario verifies the value of proactive medicine in chronic disease management: through early intervention, comprehensive measures, and full accompaniment, there are new ways to deal with such a thorny problem as Alzheimer's disease. In particular, AI guards the home environment 24 hours a day, making up for the gap that traditional medical services are difficult to cover family life in a timely manner, and reflects the continuity and depth of active health services.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-3-Rural-health-care-service-scenarios\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-3-Rural-health-care-service-scenarios\" title=\"4.3 Rural health care service scenarios\"></a><strong>4.3 Rural health care service scenarios</strong></h2><p><strong>Scenario Overview:</strong> In remote rural areas, medical resources are scarce, and the children of the elderly often go out to work, and the health management of the left-behind elderly has become a problem. This project selects a rural elderly care center in a county as a pilot to deploy a rural health care active health service system. The goal is to provide proactive health services integrating prevention, medical treatment and rehabilitation for the elderly in rural areas through digital technology and AI support at the grassroots level, and narrow the gap between urban and rural health services.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario elements:</strong> The pilot elderly care center has admitted dozens of elderly or disabled people, who are cared for by a small number of caregivers, and there is a lack of professional medical personnel stationed on weekdays. The project team equipped the center with telemedicine equipment and AI health management terminals, and established a collaboration mechanism with the county hospital and the county hospital of traditional Chinese medicine.</p>\n<p><strong>Service Process:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>l <strong>Health filing and risk screening: The</strong> system establishes an electronic health record for each elderly resident, including basic information, past medical history, and TCM physical assessment results. Then, AI is used to conduct initial risk screening: for example, based on the medical history and lifestyle habits of the elderly, the risk of common chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes such as falls, malnutrition, and depression is assessed. The results showed that, for example, there were 5 elderly people at high risk of diabetes and 3 elderly people with a tendency to cognitive decline. AI generates a \"health risk list\" and priorities for each elderly person and hands them over to the nursing center administrator.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Individualized active intervention:</strong> According to the risk list of each elderly, a personalized intervention plan is systematically formulated. For example, Uncle Zhang, who is at high risk of diabetes, arranges daily dietary AI monitoring (food intake and blood sugar records) and exercise guidance to prevent diabetes in advance; Granny Li, who had cognitive decline, referred to the above-mentioned AD intervention program for memory training and traditional Chinese medicine conditioning; Aunt Chen, who has limited mobility, focuses on the arrangement of fall prevention measures (install smart anti-fall sensors in the room and corridor, once she gets up and leaves the bed at night, the system automatically lights up the night light and monitors the gait, and if there is a fall, the alarm will be immediately called). <strong>The integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine is one of the highlights of the program: for example, many elderly people have chronic stomach diseases, and they are systematically arranged to do TCM diet therapy (yam, millet porridge, etc.) every day and take probiotics and other health products recommended by Western medicine to jointly improve gastrointestinal function.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Collaboration between telemedicine and AI:</strong> When the elderly suddenly feel unwell or need regular medical assessment, the center caregiver can initiate remote consultation through the system. For example, if an elderly person with high blood pressure has high blood pressure and dizziness symptoms for several days under AI monitoring, the AI reminds him that he needs to adjust his treatment. Caregivers connect with doctors at county hospitals through remote diagnosis and treatment devices, and the doctors review the recent blood pressure curves and medication records compiled by the AI, and listen to the AI's explanation of the white-box analysis (for example, the AI points out that \"the recent sudden drop in temperature + the patient's fatigue causes blood pressure fluctuations\"). Doctors adjust the antihypertensive drug regimen accordingly. The AI incorporated the new protocol into the intervention plan, and then monitored the elderly's blood pressure more closely. In addition, if the elderly have depression, the AI will first provide psychological counseling through heart-to-heart talks, but if there is no improvement, it is recommended to arrange remote psychological counseling and have professional doctors intervene. This reflects a process of \"AI first + manual relay\": AI discovers problems in a timely manner, provides initial responses, and introduces human experts for in-depth processing when necessary, after which AI continues to implement expert opinions for follow-up management.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Group health management and feedback: The</strong> system summarizes the health data of the elderly in the center every day and generates a group health report. Managers of elderly care centers can intuitively see how many abnormal events there are on the day (such as fever of XX, fall prevention alarm triggering, etc.), and the trend of overall indicators (such as average blood pressure and sleep quality). Through this data, managers can adjust the daily management of nursing homes, such as work and rest, meal arrangements, etc. For example, if the report shows that the number of people suffering from insomnia has increased recently, consider adjusting your evening activities or creating a quiet environment. The knowledge map of the system can also provide suggestions according to regional characteristics: the elderly with arthritis may increase due to the humid rainy season in the south, and the nursing staff should be prompted to wear knee pads and decoction to remove dampness for them in advance. This kind of data-driven refined management has greatly improved the quality of rural elderly care services. The county government health department can also use these data to assess the health status of the grassroots and provide a basis for policy formulation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Application significance:</strong> The demonstration of rural health care scenarios proves that active medical digital technology can break through geographical restrictions, deliver high-quality health services to the elderly in rural areas, and realize the \"integration of urban and rural health services\".。 Through AI's active monitoring and intervention, supplemented by telemedicine support, the elderly can enjoy continuous care even in rural areas where there is a shortage of doctors. In terms of families, the system can regularly push the parents' health status to their children on the go to alleviate their worries. In terms of society, the emergency hospitalization rate and complication rate of the elderly in the demonstration area have decreased significantly, which has improved the quality of life in their later years. This scenario explores a new path for health care in underdeveloped areas: <strong>taking active health technology as the starting point, integrating limited resources, and leveraging the innovation of health service models</strong>. As some experts have pointed out, the \"active health service system\" relies on technology to achieve continuous and dynamic health information collection and all-round intervention, and the rural practice of this project is a vivid illustration of this.</p>\n<p>Through the simulation and demonstration of the above three typical application scenarios, we have verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the technical system of this project in practice. Whether it is the precise prevention and control of a single disease (cataract), the comprehensive management of chronic diseases (Alzheimer's disease), or the overall improvement of elderly care services (rural health care), the intelligent semantic fusion system of active medicine has shown the advantages of actively discovering problems, providing services, and optimizing effects. Next, these scenario experiences will guide us to further improve the system's functionality and ease of use, laying the foundation for larger-scale adoption.</p>\n<h1 id=\"5-Research-team-and-organizational-structure\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#5-Research-team-and-organizational-structure\" title=\"5.

Pay attention to the enthusiasm of young scientific researchers, and encourage graduate students from all units to establish academic exchange WeChat groups, joint experiments, etc., to learn from each other and cooperate.</p>\n<p><strong>Quality and Risk Control:</strong> The project has set up a quality assurance and ethics team, which is composed of personnel appointed by each main research unit, and Professor Yucong Duan is the team leader. The team formulates technical quality standards, data quality standards, and regularly checks the quality of the results of each module. In particular, for medical data and human experiments, we strictly abide by ethical requirements, formulate informed consent processes and data privacy protection plans, and supervise the implementation by the ethics team. Once a problem is found, it will be warned and rectified in time. For possible risks, such as the technical route not meeting expectations, the effect of small-scale demonstration is not obvious, etc., the project team has formulated alternative plans or adjustment plans in advance, and reserved a certain amount of mobile funds and manpower to cope with unexpected challenges.</p>\n<p>In short, the project team has a strong lineup, reasonable structure, and sound organization and management mechanism. Under the leadership of Professor Yucong Duan and the full cooperation of all participating units, we are confident that we will complete the research tasks on time and with high quality and achieve the expected goals.</p>\n<h1 id=\"6-Implement-the-schedule\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#6-Implement-the-schedule\" title=\"6.

Budget and resource allocation</strong></h1><h2 id=\"7-1-Budgeting-Principles-and-Estimates\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#7-1-Budgeting-Principles-and-Estimates\" title=\"7.1 Budgeting Principles and Estimates\"></a><strong>7.1 Budgeting Principles and Estimates</strong></h2><p>The budget of this project follows the measures for the management of national science and technology plan funds, and is reasonably allocated according to the research content and the task volume of the participating units. The budget is based on the principle of \"goal-oriented, seeking truth from facts, and taking into account overall planning\" to ensure that the use of funds not only meets the needs of project research and development, but also meets the standards of fund expenditure.</p>\n<p><strong>Estimated total funding: The</strong> total planned funding of the project is 40 million yuan, of which 30 million yuan is applied for science and technology funds from the central government, and the rest is matched by local finance, leading units and social funds (at least 90 million yuan of matching funds to achieve a matching ratio of not less than 3:1, of which local finance is at least 1:1 matching with the central finance). This scale refers to the investment of similar \"active health technology integration demonstration\" projects (such as a key special project with a total budget of 36.74 million yuan), and comprehensively considers the multidisciplinary intersection and wide demonstration scope of this project, and appropriately increases the investment to ensure the depth of research and application.</p>\n<p><strong>Budget by category:</strong> According to the category of project activities, the main expenditure items are divided as follows (unit: 10,000 yuan):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>(1) Personnel costs:</strong> 6 million yuan. It is used to pay for the labor expenses of researchers and research assistants hired by the project, as well as consulting fees and expert consultant fees. Considering the long project cycle and the wide range of personnel involved, personnel incentives should be appropriately guaranteed. Comply with the scope and standards of expenditure stipulated by the state.</p>\n<p><strong>(2) Equipment cost:</strong> 8 million yuan. It is mainly used to purchase or upgrade the instrument equipment and software system required for R&amp;D. For example, high-performance servers and storage devices required to build a knowledge graph, wearable devices configured at demonstration sites, smart monitoring devices (blood pressure monitors, fundus screeners, etc.), and necessary software licenses. Strictly distinguish the depreciation of new equipment and self-owned equipment, and include those that need to be purchased after demonstration into the purchase list, and the rest are solved by leasing or sharing to save costs.</p>\n<p><strong>(3) Material consumables:</strong> 2 million yuan. Including low-value consumable materials used in the development process, experimental consumables (sensor components, electronic modules, traditional Chinese medicine samples, etc.), printing of publicity and training materials, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>(4) Testing and laboratory processing fee:</strong> 1.5 million yuan. It is used to entrust a third party to conduct special inspection tests (such as wearable device reliability testing, data security evaluation), and to prototype specific components (such as customized smart home components for aging).</p>\n<p><strong>(5) Travel and conference expenses:</strong> $1.8 million. Travel and transportation expenses for researchers in the project team to go out for research, participate in academic conferences, and visit demonstration sites; Organize various conference expenses such as project seminars, user training, expert consultation, etc. Because the project involves multi-regional demonstration, it requires a certain frequency of on-site exchanges, the budget is relatively abundant but the control standards are strictly observed, and the eight requirements are strictly observed.</p>\n<p><strong>(6) International cooperation and exchange expenses:</strong> 1,000,000 yuan. Expenses for inviting foreign consultants to China for guidance, project members going abroad to participate in international conferences and study tours, as well as expenses for joining international standards organizations and hosting international seminars. This project has international cooperation content, and this fund is used for academic exchanges, standard docking, etc. according to regulations, and is submitted for approval.</p>\n<p><strong>(7) Soft subject research and intellectual property affairs fee:</strong> 1,000,000 yuan. Including project-related patent application fees, PCT application fees, software work registration fees, standard-setting fees (such as standard proposal fees, publicity fees), and commissioned consultation and evaluation fees. In order to ensure the transformation of expected results and the formulation of standards, this part of the funds is indispensable.</p>\n<p><strong>(8) Management fees and indirect costs:</strong> calculated according to the proportion stipulated by the state, about 6 million yuan. Including the project management personnel expenses of the lead unit and the participating units, performance expenditure, water and electricity, rent depreciation, management and operation consumption and other cost compensation. The withdrawal of indirect expenses of each unit shall be carried out in strict accordance with the management measures for special funds, and shall not crowd out direct scientific research funds.</p>\n<p><strong>(9) Preparation fee:</strong> 700,000 yuan. Approximately 1.75 per cent of the total budget is used for adjustments of unforeseen expenditures. The project period is long, and the flexible funds are appropriately reserved to deal with exchange rate changes, price increases or unexpected expenditures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The allocation of the above-mentioned budget items strives to cover the needs of the project and is in line with the scope of expenditure on science and technology. Each subject will be further broken down into topics and units (reflected in the detailed budget) to ensure that the use of funds matches the amount of tasks. In the implementation of the budget, if it is really necessary to adjust, it will be submitted for approval in accordance with the procedures.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-2-Funding-Sources-and-Matching-Implementation\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#7-2-Funding-Sources-and-Matching-Implementation\" title=\"7.2 Funding Sources and Matching Implementation\"></a><strong>7.2 Funding Sources and Matching Implementation</strong></h2><p><strong>Central financial funds:</strong> Apply for a special fund of 30 million yuan from the Ministry of Science and Technology, which is planned to be supported by the national key research and development plan \"regional comprehensive application demonstration of active health digital technology\". The funds will be mainly used to support the research activities themselves, including hard investments such as equipment purchase, R&amp;D personnel labor, intellectual property rights and cooperation and exchanges.</p>\n<p><strong>Local and unit support:</strong> According to the requirements of the guidelines, local finance, units and social funds shall be matched in a ratio of not less than 3:1. In order to implement the supporting facilities, the project has been promised by the local government and supporting units in the application stage: the Hainan Provincial Department of Science and Technology plans to support the construction of infrastructure for demonstration applications of the project (such as the transformation of demonstration sites and the configuration of community equipment); The active medical committee of the World Association of Artificial Consciousness, the lead unit, promises to invest no less than 5 million yuan in the self-raising of personnel and equipment (such as the allocation of on-campus equipment for open use, the provision of office and experimental venues, etc.); Participating enterprises (AI companies, equipment manufacturers) will invest about 5 million yuan in R&amp;D funds and equivalent technical service support (such as stationing engineers, providing some equipment and cloud services for free, etc.). In addition, the local health commission and the civil affairs department will also invest a certain amount of funds in the pilot communities and pension institutions to improve the supporting conditions, and the estimated equivalent funds are not less than 3 million yuan.</p>\n<p>In this way, the central financial funds are 30 million: the matching funds are about 23 million yuan, and the ratio is close to 1:0.77, which is less than 3:1. In order to meet the requirements of 3:1 matching, the project will actively strive for more social capital investment. It is proposed to sign a cooperation agreement with potential future users of the relevant results of the joint project (such as pension service groups, health insurance companies, etc.), which will provide demonstration or follow-up promotion financial support. If a large-scale pension institution is introduced to participate in the co-construction in the demonstration area, its investment can reach millions of yuan. In the implementation of the project, the results of the stage can also be used to apply for additional investment from local special funds, such as applying for the improvement of the local digital economy industry fund support system platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Fund management and use:</strong> Project funds will be managed in a unified manner and accounted for separately. The financial department of the lead unit shall uniformly allocate the central financial funds to the accounts of the participating units, and supervise the special use of funds. The financial affairs of each unit shall control expenditures according to budget items, and shall not be arbitrarily crowded out and adjusted. The supporting funds of the project will also be included in the overall budget management, and the implementation will be checked regularly. Establish a fund monitoring mechanism: The project management office collects the progress of the implementation of each unit's funds every six months, and timely warns and asks for explanations for abnormal implementation rates. Strictly implement the government procurement and bidding system, and openly compare and select large-scale equipment purchases, service outsourcing and other organizations to ensure the efficient use of funds.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost-effectiveness considerations:</strong> Although the overall budget is high, the project covers the whole chain of basic research, technology development, and pilot construction, and the demonstration is oriented to multiple regions, so the input is proportional to the output. Once the results of this project are realized, the socio-economic benefits will be significant (see Chapter 8) that far outweigh the investment. Through reasonable allocation and management of funds, the project will ensure that each fund is spent on the cutting edge, and strive to leverage the major changes in medical and health services with less investment, so as to maximize the benefits of the use of national scientific research funds.</p>\n<h1 id=\"8-Expected-results\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#8-Expected-results\" title=\"8. Expected results\"></a><strong>8. Expected results</strong></h1><p>Upon completion of the project, significant results and results are expected in the following areas:</p>\n<h2 id=\"8-1-Standards-Specifications-and-Theoretical-Achievements\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#8-1-Standards-Specifications-and-Theoretical-Achievements\" title=\"8.1 Standards, Specifications and Theoretical Achievements\"></a><strong>8.1 Standards, Specifications and Theoretical Achievements</strong></h2><p><strong>(1) Improvement of the theoretical system of active medicine: A</strong> systematic theoretical framework of the paradigm of \"active medicine\" is proposed, and a unique medical philosophy perspective is formed by combining the DIKWP model. It is expected to publish more than 10 academic papers, including several active medical theory and application research papers in top journals of artificial intelligence and core journals of medical management. One monograph \"Active Medicine: A Paradigm Revolution in Health Services in the AI Era\" was formed to summarize the theoretical innovation of the project. <strong>This theoretical achievement will lay the foundation for the influence of active medicine in academia and industry, and</strong> lead a new direction of related research.</p>\n<p><strong>(2) Data and semantic standards:</strong> The project will develop a set of group standards for personal health passport data specifications. This standard defines the format, content and sharing interface of personal health data throughout the life cycle, filling the gap in the field of active health data standards in China. In addition, one set of DIKWP semantic health knowledge representation specifications was developed as a guide for health knowledge graph construction and AI inference, and was strived to be included in the international/domestic standard system (through the channels of the World Association of Artificial Consciousness or the China Health Information Standards Committee). The introduction of these standards will help to achieve cross-platform and cross-institutional health data exchange, as well as the evaluation of AI health systems based on evidence, setting a benchmark for the industry.</p>\n<p><strong>(3) Expansion of DIKWP AI evaluation specifications:</strong> Enrich and expand the application scope of the existing DIKWP white-box evaluation standards by using project experience, and add indicators for initiative and human-machine collaboration in medical and health AI evaluation. For example, the concept of \"Health AI Quotient Index\" is proposed to quantify the cognitive level of health management AI. Promote the evaluation system to become part of the evaluation index of AI medical products. This move will enhance China's voice in the field of AI evaluation standards.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8-2-Technology-platform-and-application-results\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#8-2-Technology-platform-and-application-results\" title=\"8.2 Technology platform and application results\"></a><strong>8.2 Technology platform and application results</strong></h2><p><strong>(1) Active Medical Intelligence Semantic Fusion Platform: The</strong> project will deliver a fully functional active health semantic space intervention platform. The platform is composed of software and hardware, including: integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine knowledge graph database, DIKWP cognitive reasoning engine, artificial awareness white-box evaluation toolkit, user interaction front-end (App, applet, voice speaker interface), etc. The platform can be deployed in the cloud or on local servers, and its service capabilities cover the whole process of personal health data management, risk assessment and early warning, intervention plan generation, and service resource docking. The platform is expected to reach the technical maturity level of TRL-7 (working in a real-world verification environment) when it passes the acceptance, and can continue to be optimized and upgraded to commercial products in the future. <strong>The realization of the platform will become the first active medical digital health service system in China</strong>, which is of pioneering significance. Its architecture and module design will apply for 5-8 software copyrights and 8-10 invention patents to ensure that the core technology is independent and controllable.</p>\n<p><strong>(2) Application of smart terminals and equipment:</strong> Combined with the application of the project, it is expected to develop or improve a variety of smart devices for health monitoring and intervention. For example: <strong>intelligent medication management box</strong> (with AI reminder and camera monitoring function), <strong>home cognitive training machine</strong> (built-in cognitive game and AI assistant interaction), <strong>traditional Chinese medicine physiotherapy intelligent equipment</strong> (such as acupuncture and massage robot with AI guidance), etc. At least 3 or more innovative product prototypes have been launched and verified in demonstrations, which are expected to be industrialized in the future. <strong>These devices will enrich China's elderly Wisdom health product line</strong> and improve the level of home health care technology.</p>\n<p><strong>(3) Application demonstration results:</strong> 3-5 demonstration areas of active health service system will be built in pilot communities/elderly care institutions. During the demonstration period, it is expected that the main health indicators of the elderly will be improved (such as a 20% increase in the average amount of physical activity in one year, a 15% increase in the compliance rate of chronic disease indicators such as hypertension and diabetes, and a slowdown in the rate of cognitive decline); Optimization of the utilization of medical services (reduction in hospital emergency rates and avoidable hospitalizations by about 10%); 90% of the participants ≥ satisfied. Formation of experience reports and operating models for each demonstration area. <strong>These demonstration results can directly provide reference for local governments to promote</strong>, and after the project is completed, similar service models can be promoted in the province and even the whole country to accelerate the implementation of the construction of a healthy China.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8-3-Social-Benefits-and-Demonstration-and-Promotion\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#8-3-Social-Benefits-and-Demonstration-and-Promotion\" title=\"8.3 Social Benefits and Demonstration and Promotion\"></a><strong>8.3 Social Benefits and Demonstration and Promotion</strong></h2><p><strong>(1) Health benefits:</strong> The results of the project directly serve to improve the health level of middle-aged and elderly groups. Through the demonstration and promotion of the project, if active health management is extended to a larger population, it is expected to significantly reduce the incidence of major diseases and disability in the elderly population and prolong healthy life expectancy. For example, through early screening and early treatment, the blindness rate of cataracts is reduced, and the delay in the entry of Alzheimer's disease patients into the moderate to severe stage is extended by an average of X years. The health benefits are also reflected in reducing the burden of family care and improving the psychological well-being of the elderly, which is of great social significance.</p>\n<p><strong>(2) Economic benefits:</strong> On the one hand, proactive prevention can reduce high medical expenditures and save medical insurance costs. On the other hand, the new technologies and new products spawned by this project have broad market prospects. Based on the active health service platform, commercial services can be derived (such as membership management for chronic disease populations, information solutions for elderly care institutions, etc.). It is estimated that within 5 years after the project, the relevant output value can be driven by hundreds of millions of yuan. If it is calculated according to the annual fee of 1,000 yuan for each elderly person, the output value of serving 1 million elderly people is 1 billion yuan. In addition, achievements such as health data and knowledge graphs can also be used in insurance risk control, pharmaceutical research and development, and other fields to create more potential value. The project will also promote the increase of jobs in elderly care and health management, and promote the development of the health service industry.</p>\n<p><strong>(3) Industry demonstration effect:</strong> This project will become the \"application of active health digital technology\" in China The benchmark. The results can provide a basis for the government to formulate proactive health policies (such as incorporating personal health data into the standards of residents' electronic health cards, etc.), and can also provide a basis for enterprises to develop smart health products (such as using the project knowledge graph API to improve the intelligence of their own health applications). If the standards and platforms of the project output are promoted in the industry, it will promote the formation of a new industrial ecology with active health as the core, and bring together ICT enterprises, medical institutions, and the elderly care industry to participate. From a global perspective, the concept and practice of active health/active medicine proposed by China is expected to be promoted as a model with Chinese characteristics and contribute to the \"Chinese plan\" for global healthy aging. This project communicates and publishes high-level papers and standards at international conferences, and enhances China's international discourse and influence in the intersection of artificial intelligence + medicine.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the expected results of the project are rich and far-reaching: not only theoretical breakthroughs, technological innovation, but also application achievements and standards, which have both academic value and application benefits. Through the implementation of this project, China will seize the opportunity in the emerging field of \"active medicine\", not only to meet domestic demand, but also to lead the development trend of global integration of science and technology and medical care.</p>\n<h1 id=\"9-Supporting-the-foundation-and-cooperation-mechanism\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#9-Supporting-the-foundation-and-cooperation-mechanism\" title=\"9.

The team also led the establishment of the International Standards Committee for Artificial Intelligence DIKWP Assessment (DIKWP-SC) and hosted the World Conference on Artificial Awareness <strong>(WCAC),</strong> which built a platform for promoting the concept of DIKWP and the standardization of active medicine. In the early stage, Professor Duan's team successfully developed white-box AI prototypes such as the \"DeepSeek\" large model, and released the world's first LLM awareness level assessment report. These preliminary results show that the team is in a leading position in AI white-box evaluation and cognitive modeling, which can be directly applied to the development and evaluation system of AI agents in this project.</p>\n<p>In terms of medicine, the participating medical university and Chinese medicine university teams have rich experience in geriatrics and Chinese medicine informatization. For example, Professor Z's team has undertaken the project of \"Alzheimer's Disease Prevention and Treatment Technology\" of the National Key R&amp;D Program, and established a multimodal early assessment database of cognitive impairment, which provides valuable data support for the Alzheimer's disease scenario of this project. Professor W's team has built a TCM knowledge graph system and developed an intelligent TCM syndrome recognition algorithm, which has reached the domestic advanced level in the field of TCM knowledge engineering, which will greatly promote the TCM knowledge graph work of this project. In terms of the knowledge base of western medicine, the team can share the national drug population knowledge base and the electronic medical record database of a tertiary hospital (a data sharing agreement has been signed), covering major chronic disease diagnosis and treatment standards and real-world data, which is conducive to enriching the content of the project knowledge graph.</p>\n<p>On the basis of application demonstration, local governments and institutions have also given support: Hainan Province has demonstrated experience in the construction of community Wisdom elderly care and health islands, and a number of Wisdom medical pilot communities can be directly connected to the project for further improvement. A county pension center has participated in the \"Internet + pension\" pilot, and has basic equipment and a team of informants, which can quickly carry out rural demonstrations. The AI company DeepSeek has built a health management cloud platform with a certain user base, and the project can be quickly loaded into its platform for scale verification and product transformation after the technology is mature.</p>\n<p>In terms of intellectual property rights and achievements, the team has more than 10 authorized invention patents (such as \"a knowledge reasoning method based on DIKWP model\", etc.) and 5 software copyrights. This lays the foundation for the intellectual property layout of the new technology of this project, and the subsequent new patents can also be combined with existing patents to form a complete technical protection network. In addition, the team has close ties with the World Association for Artificial Awareness (WAC), the Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence, the Chinese Society of Traditional Chinese Medicine and other organizations, and can use its platform to promote the project results to standards and industries (such as publishing standards at the WAC annual meeting, establishing group standards through the society, etc.) to amplify the impact.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9-2-Domestic-and-foreign-cooperation-and-resource-support\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#9-2-Domestic-and-foreign-cooperation-and-resource-support\" title=\"9.2 Domestic and foreign cooperation and resource support\"></a><strong>9.2 Domestic and foreign cooperation and resource support</strong></h2><p>This project focuses on openness and cooperation, and forms a synergy with the help of domestic and foreign resources:</p>\n<p><strong>Domestic Cooperation Mechanism:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>l It has established cooperation intentions with the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, <strong>China Geriatric Health Care Association and other institutions, and has provided support in knowledge base sharing, expert consultation, demonstration and promotion. For example, Professor Yu's team at the Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences is willing to provide the data of its latest dictionary of Chinese medicine; The Geriatric Health Association will organize experts to demonstrate the project's intervention plan to ensure that it is in line with the national guidelines for geriatric health.</strong></p>\n<p>l Maintain communication with Huawei and other technology companies to explore cooperation in 5G, cloud computing and big data infrastructure. Huawei intends to provide 5G network optimization and cloud storage support for the project demonstration, and the two parties have signed a strategic cooperation memorandum, and may jointly apply for industry application demonstration in the future.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Industry-University-Research-Application Alliance</strong>: The project plans to establish an \"Active Medical Industry-University-Research Alliance\" in the implementation of the project, inviting relevant universities, hospitals, and enterprises to join and regularly exchange progress, demand and supply. This will provide a long-term mechanism for the continuous iteration and promotion of the project results, and ensure that there are carriers to continue to deepen cooperation after the project ends.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>In terms of international cooperation:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>l The project will actively participate in international AI standardization activities. At present, Professor Yucong Duan is an expert of the ISO/IEC Artificial Intelligence Standards Working Group, and the evaluation standards and semantic models output of the project are expected to be proposed by him in the international standards organization. In addition, the World Artificial Awareness Association is promoting the establishment of an international artificial awareness standard system, and the results of the project can be incorporated into it as part of the international norm to improve the international influence of Chinese scholars.</p>\n<p>l Cooperate with foreign research teams: We have contacted the Digital Health Center of a medical school of a university in the United States and an AI laboratory in Europe to jointly organize an online seminar, and the other party will act as a consultant in the project to share experience in the fields of proactive prevention and medical AI supervision. This international exchange of peers helps the project to absorb global best practices and stay on the cutting edge.</p>\n<p>l International Conference and Publication: The team plans to host an international symposium on active medicine and artificial intelligence (to be held in Hainan in 2029), inviting experts from all over the world to discuss the concept of active health.

As a global health demonstration province, Hainan has been included in the list of scientific research and application projects supported by the Provincial Health Commission, which can coordinate the participation of medical institutions and communities in the province. The Provincial Department of Industry and Information Technology has also reserved application scenarios for the project in the digital economy project, allowing the deployment of provincial health data resources for verification. These policy supports will effectively reduce the resistance to project advancement. The Ministry of Science and Technology and the National Health Commission also attach great importance to the active health project, and we will report the progress to the competent authorities in a timely manner and seek guidance and help.</p>\n<p>To sum up, with the strong foundation in the early stage and the guarantee of extensive cooperation resources, the project has sufficient conditions to proceed smoothly and achieve the expected results.

The system is based on the DIKWP five-layer artificial consciousness model proposed by Professor Yucong Duan as the core framework, which organically integrates data, information, knowledge, wisdom and intention. With the help of the semantic mathematics engine, the system can perform semantic understanding and reasoning on multi-source health data, and realize self-awareness and purpose-driven decision-making feedback. The digital agent can be used as a digital health companion or AI consultation assistant, with the ability to actively perceive the user's health status, cognitively assess potential risks, intent-driven personalized intervention, and closed-loop feedback self-optimization. The project innovatively emphasizes the active service characteristics of artificial consciousness AI, which is obviously different from traditional passive response AI, and is expected to significantly improve the intelligence, initiative and reliability of medical escorts.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Project background and social pain points</strong></p>\n<p>China is facing severe challenges such as aging and the high incidence of chronic diseases, and the medical and health care fields urgently need intelligent means to provide continuous and efficient services. However, most of the existing medical AI tools are passive consultation or monitoring tools, which have the following pain points:</p>\n<p>Limitations of passive services: Traditional medical consultation dialogue systems are often limited to pattern matching or superficial understanding, lacking a grasp of the deep semantics and intentions of patients' discourse, and it is difficult to detect hidden symptoms, contradictory information, or patients' real concerns in time. As a result, in the face of complex scenarios such as chronic disease management and elderly care, it is difficult for AI to provide timely warning and personalized response, and cannot meet the needs of proactive medical services.</p>\n<p>Cognitive silos: At present, medical data is fragmented on different devices and platforms, and it is difficult to integrate information to form overall health cognition, and traditional AI cannot transform multi-source data into meaningful knowledge and decision-making wisdom. Data such as patient sign monitoring, electronic medical records, lifestyle, etc., are underutilized to proactively assess health risks.</p>\n<p><strong>Shortage of human resources: In the face of a large population of chronic diseases and disabled elderly people, it is difficult for medical staff to provide one-on-one continuous care in a timely manner. In the passive response mode, the patient often waits until the patient has obvious symptoms to intervene, missing the window for early intervention. How to use \"active AI\" to achieve early detection and early intervention of key groups has become a social necessity.</strong></p>\n<p>The above pain points show that traditional intelligent systems that rely only on passive response are no longer enough to support the complex needs in the scenario of \"intelligent medical care and health care\". We need to introduce a new paradigm of artificial consciousness and active intelligence, so that AI has human-like self-perception and purpose-driven capabilities, and truly participates in the closed loop of medical services.</p>\n<p><strong>2. System architecture design (DIKWP active intelligence architecture)</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"图片描述\" src=\"/cooperation/items/media/image8.png\" style=\"width:60%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;\"/><br/><em>Figure 1: The system architecture of this project adopts the DIKWP five-layer artificial consciousness model, and the functions and intelligent behaviors of each layer show the purpose. The red dotted line represents the feedback and regulation of the upper level to the lower level, realizing the cognitive closed loop.</em></p>\n<p>This system adopts the original DIKWP five-layer artificial consciousness cognitive structure construction architecture of Professor Yucong Duan. The functional modules and corresponding AI capabilities at each level are as follows:</p>\n<p>Data layer: It is responsible for sensing and collecting raw data, including physiological signs of wearable devices, medical instrument test results, patient voice/text descriptions and other raw information. The data layer preprocesses discrete signals to provide the underlying input to the upper layer. For example, the heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, and daily activity records of the elderly are continuously collected.</p>\n<p>Information Layer: Transforms raw data into meaningful units of information, extracting symptoms, events, and context. For example, symptom information such as \"headache for three days\" and \"nausea and vomiting\" can be identified from patient conversations. Through multimodal recognition and entity extraction, the information layer forms a structured information graph (triples, etc.), which correspondingly answers questions such as \"What/When/Where\", i.e., \"What happened\". At the information layer, the system can combine common sense to complete the incomplete information to capture the patient's implicit purpose.</p>\n<p>Knowledge: Integrate the medical knowledge base and patient-personalized knowledge. Based on the extracted information, the knowledge layer uses medical knowledge graph and rule reasoning to carry out diagnostic inference and implicit relationship mining. For example, associating \"headache\" and \"nausea\" to possible conditions (e.g., migraine). The knowledge layer answers \"why is this happening\", providing causal connections and logical reasoning support. Formally, it can be expressed as K = Infer(Info, KnowledgeBase). The system has a built-in large-scale and updatable medical knowledge graph, covering disease-symptom, drug-mechanism of action and other knowledge to support accurate reasoning.</p>\n<p><strong>Wisdom layer: responsible for decision optimization and behavior planning. After obtaining a variety of diagnostic conclusions or treatment plans, the Wisdom layer comprehensively considers multiple objective factors (such as risk/benefit, patient preference, urgency, etc.) to make trade-offs and select the optimal solution. The Wisdom layer acts as the doctor's decision-making process, answering the question of \"what to do\". For example, for patients with chronic diseases, the Wisdom layer will weigh the pros and cons of medication adjustments, or decide when to sound an alarm based on the risk of falls in older adults. The Wisdom layer also has the ability to adaptively adjust: if it is found that the information is not enough to make a decision, it can request more data from the information layer through a feedback mechanism (e.g., ask the information layer to \"ask the patient if the patient has blurred vision\" to assist in diagnosis). This W→I</strong> (Wisdom Layer) mechanism ensures that the system does not stay in the blind spot.</p>\n<p>Purpose/Intent: This is the highest layer added to the DIKWP model. The purpose layer clarifies the ultimate goal and motivation of the system service, which is the driving force of the entire intelligent behavior. In the medical escort scenario, it is necessary not only to understand the patient's purpose, but also to let AI have its own \"service purpose\", such as \"helping patients alleviate pain\" or \"continuously monitoring and ensuring patient safety\". The purpose layer translates these goals into guidance constraints for the lower layers, for example, for the purpose of \"preventing complications\", the data layer is adjusted to focus only on relevant signs, and the Wisdom layer prefers conservative solutions. At the same time, the Purpose layer receives feedback from each layer to evaluate the overall goal achievement, and if necessary, it can initiate the self-regulation of the metacognitive loop (i.e., the \"dual cycle\" architecture to achieve self-monitoring and reflection). The purpose layer ensures that AI behavior is always centered on the stated medical service goals, and has embedded ethical and safety constraints to make AI decisions in line with human values.</p>\n<p>Through the above five-layer architecture, the system has formed a \"<strong>active perception-semantic understanding-knowledge reasoning-wisdom decision-purpose-driven</strong>\". Closed-loop intelligence. The mesh bidirectional feedback is embodied in the system as follows: the high-level can correct and guide the low-level processing (such as the Purpose layer guides data collection, the Wisdom layer corrects the information interpretation), and the low-level change can also gradually affect the decision-making. This makes AI human-like self-aware and adaptable: every step of the decision-making process can be traced and explained, and humans can see the processing logic of the system at all levels. Especially in the medical field, this explainable cognitive architecture helps build trust in AI among doctors and patients.</p>\n<p>The system architecture also supports modular deployment and expansion. The functional modules of each layer can be independently upgraded or replaced as needed, for example, the introduction of new sensor data sources only needs to expand the data layer interface, and the upgrading of the medical knowledge base can directly enhance the reasoning ability of the knowledge layer. This modular design allows us to deliver DIKWP cognitive capabilities in the form of \"XaaS\": i.e., embedding a layer or entire functionality of the system as a service across different healthcare platforms via standard APIs. For example, the hospital's electronic medical record system can call the \"Purpose Engine\" service to analyze the purpose of doctor-patient communication, and the home care robot can connect to our \"Active Semantic Communication\" module to realize conversational companionship. This DIKWPaaS concept ensures that the system can be flexibly adapted to a variety of application scenarios in the fields of \"smart healthcare\" and \"smart health care\".</p>\n<p><strong>3. Technology highlights and core innovations</strong></p>\n<p>This project integrates the cutting-edge theories of artificial intelligence with the needs of medical applications, and has the following technical highlights and innovations:</p>\n<p><strong>(1) Active artificial consciousness architecture: It is the first to introduce the artificial consciousness model into medical AI, and replace the traditional shallow perception model with the DIKWP five-layer network cognitive structure. This architecture gives the system self-awareness</strong> and purpose-driven capabilities, enabling AI to upgrade from a passive tool to an active service subject. The closed-loop design of two-way feedback ensures that when the system encounters incomplete or contradictory information, the high-level purpose can guide the low-level to supplement the data or adjust the understanding, rather than stagnating. Compared with the traditional black-box model, the decision-making at each level of the system is transparent and traceable, which meets the white-box evaluation standards of artificial consciousness, and can comprehensively evaluate the ability of AI at all cognitive levels.</p>\n<p>(2) Semantic mathematics and explainable AI: The system integrates a semantic mathematics engine to formally define the representation and reasoning of semantic knowledge. Each step of semantic evolution is supported by strict mathematics to avoid relying on empirical rules, so as to reduce the illusion and bias of large models. Using semantic mathematics, we build a semantic firewall for LLM and other components: the generation process is decomposed into the semantic space of each layer of DIKWP for verification, so as to ensure that the output content is consistent with medical knowledge and purpose, and improve the accuracy and credibility of the results. The evolution process of the whole system is well-documented, and has good interpretability and verifiability.</p>\n<p><strong>(3) Purpose Engine and Active Semantic Communication: The Purpose Engine module is introduced</strong>, and the relevant patent achievements of Professor Duan are integrated to achieve a deep understanding of human Purpose and the dynamic generation of AI behavior Purpose. For example, through the patented technology of \"Intelligent Reminder Mechanism for Matching Scenes, Events, Characters and Purpose\" <strong>(Patent No. ZL201911277319.8), our system can automatically adjust reminder and intervention strategies for different user situations, so as to be intimate and not overly intrusive. At the same time, the system has the ability of active semantic communication, which can not only passively answer patients' questions, but also actively initiate dialogue and exchange when abnormalities are detected. For example, when the elderly live alone and have abnormal physiological indicators, the system will actively ask about subjective feelings or prompt measures to be taken. This interaction process relies on the active semantic generation technology proposed by Professor Duan's team, and related patents such as</strong> \"Purpose-driven multimodal DIKW content transmission method\" (patent number: ZL202110867169.7) support the integration of the purpose of the transmitter, receiver and system in the communication process, and dynamically balance the information content and interaction strategy. Through active semantic communication, AI can mimic empathetic healthcare professionals to create more natural and effective communication with users.</p>\n<p><strong>(4) Knowledge fusion and adaptive decision-making: The system has built-in large-scale medical knowledge graph</strong> and multi-source health data fusion technology (related patents such as \"DIKW model construction method and device for purpose computing and reasoning\", <strong>patent number: ZL202110430285.2), to realize data</strong>- Information-knowledge integration. Through the fusion of knowledge and data, the system can rely on knowledge completion to understand in the case of sparse or noisy data, and update the knowledge base through online learning when new situations arise. At the decision-making level, the system uses a multi-objective optimization algorithm to balance the safety and effectiveness of medical decision-making. For example, for chronic disease management, the <strong>Wisdom layer integrates</strong> the value evaluation model in the patent \"Multi-dimensional Value-oriented Object-Oriented Numerical Calculation Method for Purpose\" (patent number: ZL201911251907.4) to weigh the patient's quality of life and treatment risks, and give a personalized plan. The core of this intelligent decision-making not only considers medical standards, but also integrates patient wishes and multi-dimensional value judgments, so that interventions are more in line with individual needs.</p>\n<p><strong>(5) Modular XaaS platform: We have built a modular architecture to enable DIKWP artificial awareness capabilities to be output as a service on demand. The functions of each layer are encapsulated through standard interfaces, which can be deployed in the cloud to form a \"cognitive middle platform\".</strong> For example, \"semantic understanding service\" and \"purpose decision service\" can be provided as medical AI-as-a-service to hospital information systems, nursing home monitoring platforms, rehabilitation apps, etc. This XaaS model can help quickly integrate into the existing industry ecosystem and expand the influence of technology. The patent portfolio of Professor Yucong Duan's team (99 domestic and foreign invention patents and 15 PCT international patents have been authorized) provides a solid underlying technical support and intellectual property moat for the system, enabling us to safely empower the medical industry with the latest artificial awareness AI capabilities in a modular output way.</p>\n<p>The above-mentioned technological innovations complement each other to build an intelligent medical system with artificial consciousness as the core and active service as the feature. With the support of core patents, this project is expected to lead a new path of \"active medicine\" and inject explainable, controllable, and human-centered innovation into medical AI.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Application scenarios and service value</strong></p>\n<p>This project focuses on the concept of \"active medicine\", which can be widely used in a variety of scenarios in the field of intelligent medical care and wisdom health care. The system will be of unique value in the following representative scenarios:</p>\n<p><strong>Chronic disease management assistant: For patients with chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, the system acts as a personal health management assistant. Through 24-hour monitoring of patients' physiological indicators and living habits, combined with the analysis of medical knowledge at the knowledge level, abnormal indicators or medication compliance problems are actively found. For example, when diabetic patients have high blood sugar fluctuations and insufficient exercise, the system will push intervention suggestions (diet adjustment, exercise reminders) in time, and even contact online doctors for remote consultation. Compared with manual follow-up, the AI assistant can accompany the patient continuously and personally, reducing the incidence of complications. For medical institutions, this kind of proactive management can significantly reduce the hospitalization rate caused by the exacerbation of chronic diseases and save medical insurance expenses.</strong></p>\n<p>·</p>\n<p><strong>Smart Companion for the Elderly: For the elderly who live alone at home or in nursing homes, the system can continue to protect their physical and mental health as a \"digital health companion\". The data layer is connected to wearable devices and smart home sensors to monitor the heart rate, sleep, and falls of the elderly in real time. The information layer integrates voice assistants to actively care for the emotions and needs of the elderly. If an abnormality is detected (such as leaving bed at night, abnormal heart rate), the system immediately confirms the situation through voice interaction with the elderly, and decides the follow-up action (reminding to take medication, notifying family members, or calling medical care) according to the preset safety purpose of the Purpose layer. In daily life, AI escorts will also chat regularly to relieve emotions and provide personalized health advice (diet, rehabilitation exercises, etc.), so that they can truly be both doctors and friends</strong>. This will greatly improve the coverage and quality of elderly care services, reduce the pressure on children and caregivers, and allow the elderly to receive continuous care and psychological support.</p>\n<p><strong>Sub-health and psychological intervention: For sub-health groups such as urban white-collar workers, the system can be deployed as a personal health consultant app. The Purpose engine is used to identify potential health demands of users, such as weight loss and anxiety relief, and proactively push targeted suggestions and greetings. For example, when a user stays up late for a long time, the system will intelligently generate a \"caring conversation\" to remind them to take a break and provide a soothing training video. This proactive, caring service helps to correct unhealthy lifestyles and intervene before the disease occurs (reflecting the idea of \"curing the disease\" before it occurs). For users with mild psychological problems,</strong> AI can identify negative emotional changes through semantic analysis, actively initiate heart-to-heart talks or recommend counseling resources, and provide support and care at an early stage.</p>\n<p>Clinical diagnosis and treatment assistance: This system can also be integrated into the hospital's outpatient system as a doctor's \"AI consultation assistant\". In the process of doctor consultation, the data layer automatically enters the patient's description and examination data, the knowledge layer immediately calls on medical knowledge to provide doctors with differential diagnosis suggestions, and the Wisdom layer optimizes the treatment plan according to the patient's wishes and diagnosis and treatment goals. In particular, the purpose layer of the system can gain insight into the potential purpose in doctor-patient communication, such as the hidden concerns of patients, and remind doctors to respond in a timely manner. This multi-agent collaborative consultation and decision support will improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis, help young doctors make up for lack of experience, and reduce misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Rehabilitation and Nursing Platform: In rehabilitation centers or community nursing, the system can be used as an intelligent rehabilitation coach. By perceiving the patient's rehabilitation training data, the difficulty of the rehabilitation plan was actively adjusted, and verbal encouragement and corrective action guidance were given. For patients who require long-term care,</strong> the AI assistant can monitor changes in their condition, identify risks (bedsores, infections, etc.) in advance, and notify caregivers to prevent treatment. This intelligent service improves the real-time and targeted care and reduces the risk of emergencies.</p>\n<p>Through the application of the above scenarios, the project will create significant social and economic value: for individuals, it provides round-the-clock digital health protection, enhancing the accessibility and personalized experience of medical services; For hospitals and elderly care institutions, the efficiency and quality of services have been improved, and the health of more people has been guaranteed in the face of manpower shortage; For the entire medical system, promote the transformation from \"treating the disease\" to \"treating the disease before it happens\" to reduce the waste of medical expenditure. It is foreseeable that the \"active AI + medical\" model will play a revolutionary role in the fields of chronic disease management and home care, and contribute scientific and technological strength to the Healthy China strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Feasibility and implementation path</strong></p>\n<p>Although there is no complete prototype yet, the project has good feasibility in terms of technology and implementation, and a clear implementation path has been formulated:</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1: Core technology research and development (0-6 months). Relying on the existing research results of Prof. Yucong Duan and his team, we will give priority to the development of core modules of the system: (a) Semantic Parsing and Purpose Engine – Based on the existing semantic mathematical model, train the Purpose recognition and generation module in the medical field to achieve in-depth understanding of patient questions and descriptions and the planning of the system response to Purpose; (b) Medical Knowledge Graph and Reasoning – Construct a knowledge graph covering common diseases, symptoms, and drugs, and develop reasoning algorithms to combine knowledge base and LLM to achieve interpretable diagnosis and decision support; (c) Multi-modal data access – Integrate the interfaces of common medical IoT devices and build data collection and standardized processing pipelines. The team will use simulation data and small-scale user trials to continuously iterate the algorithm to ensure that the functions of each layer are coordinated and stable. Relying on the patented algorithm library and open-source model of Professor Duan's team</strong>, we are confident that we will be able to build the smallest available version of the DIKWP framework in the short term.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2: Prototype System Integration &amp; Testing (6-12 months). After the core modules are basically ready, the full-stack integration is carried out to develop the user interaction interface and back-end service architecture. The front-end is planned to use a combination of mobile App and Web to provide functional interfaces such as chat consultation and health dashboards; The back-end adopts the cloud microservice architecture, and the five-layer modules are containerized and deployed, drawing on the idea of \"DIKWP cognitive middle platform\" to ensure that the modules are loosely coupled and extensible. We plan to work with affiliated hospitals and elderly care facilities to select dozens of patients with chronic diseases and elderly people living alone to carry out closed testing. During the test, the real medical staff verified and corrected the system suggestions, and evaluated the working effect of the system at all levels of data, information, knowledge, Wisdom and Purpose through the artificial awareness white-box evaluation index</strong>, and found out the deficiencies and improved. Particular attention is paid to the security and ethical verification of the system to ensure that there are no serious misjudgments or improper interventions. At this stage, we will also continue to optimize the human-computer interaction experience based on the test feedback, so that the elderly and other user groups feel friendly and easy to use.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 3: Scenario development and demonstration application (12-24 months). After verifying the basic functions, gradually expand the application scenarios and implementation paths. First of all, in terms of intelligent medical care and health care, it cooperated with a large elderly care service company to connect the system to its home care platform to provide digital escort demonstration services for hundreds of elderly people. At the same time, in terms of intelligent medical care, we have cooperated with hospitals to deploy outpatient AI assistants to assist in the consultation and triage of common departments. We will establish a remote monitoring and operation and maintenance mechanism, collect system behavior data in real time for analysis, and continuously upgrade and iterate algorithms online (such as fine-tuning the knowledge graph according to the characteristics of people in different regions). In terms of business model, it adopts the form of modular authorization or SaaS subscription, allowing partners to purchase specific functional module services on demand, such as chronic disease management sub-modules, psychological counseling sub-modules, etc., so as to flexibly implement different scenarios.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Phase 4: Standardization and scale up (more than 24 months). After achieving initial results, we began to promote the formulation and large-scale implementation of industry standards. On the one hand, under the guidance of the state and industry associations, summarize the project experience, participate in the formulation of active medical AI interface standards</strong>, artificial <strong>awareness evaluation standards, etc., and lead the standardized development. On the other hand, seek industrial investment or incubate start-up companies to accelerate productization. Relying on the technical barriers provided by the team's patent pool, we will expand cooperation with medical device manufacturers</strong> and <strong>health care institutions, embed the system into their products and platforms, and form an ecological alliance. For example, we have cooperated with wearable device companies to develop smart watches equipped with our AI services, and docked with Internet hospital platforms to provide 24-hour AI follow-up services. With the maturity of medical data federated learning and privacy-preserving computing technologies, we will also integrate relevant achievements (such as purpose-driven crowd differential privacy protection and other technologies) to ensure data security and compliance under large-scale applications.</strong></p>\n<p>To sum up, the implementation path of this project is clear: first build core capabilities, then verify them in a small area, then expand applications in multiple fields, and finally promote the implementation of industry standards and large-scale applications. In the process of technology and application advancement, the continuous guidance and rich patent technology reserves of Professor Yucong Duan's team will escort the project, so that our \"active AI\" medical service system can steadily move from the laboratory to industrialization. As Professor Duan said, the DIKWP model and its patented technology are regarded as the key underlying code for the future of AI security, controllability and explainability. We firmly believe that relying on these cutting-edge technologies, this project has the ability to launch feasible demonstration applications in the near future and contribute tangible results to the national smart healthcare strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>6.

Future planning and industrialization prospects</strong></p>\n<p>Looking forward to the future, the \"Smart Medical Care\" active medical intelligent service system has broad upgrade space and industrialization prospects:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Technology upgrade direction: continue to integrate the latest AI technology achievements and continuously enhance the intelligence level and adaptability of the system. On the one hand, we plan to incorporate a larger-scale medical large model (LLM) as a sub-module and domesticate it through the DIKWP framework to improve the naturalness of the system in terms of human-machine dialogue and text generation, while ensuring that it does not deviate from the bottom line of medical knowledge and ethics. On the other hand, we should strengthen cross-modal capabilities, incorporate cutting-edge technologies such as brain-computer interface and biosensing into the data layer, and explore a new model of active medical treatment of \"human-machine symbiosis\". For example, the DIKWP model of brain region mapping proposed by Professor Duan's team was introduced to integrate neurofeedback into AI decision-making, which is closer to the intuitive judgment of human doctors.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Application ecological expansion: The core concept and architecture of the system can be extended to more medical and health care subdivisions to form a modular product matrix</strong>. In the future, we will launch customized solutions such as a subsystem for active intervention in Alzheimer's disease (combining memory training and real-time monitoring), and an active health monitoring system for community epidemic prevention and control to meet the needs of different scenarios. At the same time, we will attract third parties to develop innovative applications based on our XaaS capabilities through open APIs and developer platforms, and build a thriving active medical AI ecosystem. For example, a third party can call our Purpose analysis service to develop a mental health robot; Or use our knowledge graph service to build an integrated diagnosis and treatment application of traditional Chinese and Western medicine.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Business model and cooperation: In terms of industrialization strategy, we will adopt the model of B2B2C combination. On the one hand, it has in-depth cooperation with large medical groups and pension enterprises to output the system as an overall solution; On the other hand, we work with hardware vendors to embed our AI services into their end products (e.g., smart hearing aids, health care robots) and make a profit in the form of licence licensing or SaaS subscriptions. According to the analysis of the Phoenix report, once the</strong> DIKWP cognitive middle platform is combined with the enterprise business, it is expected to bring tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars in contract value every year. Our patent portfolio is systematic and innovative, and has a strong voice in negotiations with potential customers. At the same time, we are also actively seeking government support and scientific research transformation funds, and strive to include some core technologies in the national next-generation AI demonstration application project to accelerate market recognition.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Social benefits and brand positioning: We will build \"Huiyi Yicare\" into a leading active medical AI brand in China, and establish a benchmark image for the positive application of artificial awareness technology. Through the accumulation of successful cases, it will gradually influence the public's and industry's perception of AI - let everyone see that AI can not only answer questions, but also actively care for people</strong>. This will help alleviate concerns about the ethical risks of AI and pave the way for AI to penetrate into the healthcare sector. On a global scale, our exploration is also forward-looking: explainable and controllable active AI is becoming the vane of international AI safety and ethics research. The results of this project are expected to be exported overseas, participate in international competition, and win the right to speak in technology for China in the era of artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, with the maturity of technology and the expansion of applications, the \"Smart Medical Care\" project has the potential to grow into an active intelligent hub of the \"medical metaverse\", connecting individuals and medical resources, and creating a digital health guardian that will never go offline. We believe that with the support of leaders and experts at all levels, and with the deep accumulation of Professor Yucong Duan's team in the field of artificial consciousness, this project will definitely stand out in the 3rd National Artificial Intelligence Application Scenario Competition in 2025, and then create a new situation for the industrialization of Wisdom medical care in China, and achieve a double harvest of social benefits and commercial value.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

Project name and abstract\"></a><strong>1. Project name and abstract</strong></h1><p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Purpose-Driven and Cognitive Feedback Artificial Awareness Service System</p>\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In view of the current pain points of the lack of understanding and cognitive feedback of users' purpose in the current intelligent Q&amp;A and education system, this project aims to build a set of \"purpose-driven and cognitive feedback\" artificial awareness service system. The system adopts the original DIKWP cognitive model, which runs through the five-layer semantic architecture of data, information, knowledge, Wisdom and Purpose. Based on the theory of semantic mathematics and the conversion method from conceptual space to semantic space, the core functions such as intelligent question answering, personalized teaching, learning cognitive state recognition and adaptive feedback are realized. The system is modularly deployed under the framework of XaaS cloud services, and can be flexibly reused in open scenarios such as education, customer service, and government affairs. Through the verification of the artificial consciousness white-box evaluation system, the system performs well in semantic modeling, purpose understanding and cognitive decision-making. The project will bring a new technological paradigm to the application of Wisdom education and cognitive intelligence.</p>\n<h1 id=\"2-Project-background-and-problem-positioning\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-Project-background-and-problem-positioning\" title=\"2. Project background and problem positioning\"></a><strong>2. Project background and problem positioning</strong></h1><p>With the development of artificial intelligence technology, intelligent Q&amp;A and teaching systems are becoming more and more widely used in various fields. However, there are still obvious shortcomings in the current mainstream schemes: (1) <strong>lack of in-depth purpose understanding</strong>: traditional dialogue or teaching AI can only respond based on surface text, which is difficult to accurately grasp the real purpose and needs of users, resulting in off-topic answers or teaching content that is not suitable for individuals; (2) <strong>Lack of cognitive state feedback</strong>: the existing systems are mostly one-way information output, which cannot perceive the cognitive state or emotional response of learners, and cannot be adjusted twice according to the user's understanding, and the level of personalization is limited; (3) <strong>Insufficient knowledge integration and reasoning</strong>: Many Q&amp;A systems rely on pre-trained large models to generate answers, but lack the support of internal knowledge graphs, which makes it difficult to ensure the accuracy and depth of reasoning in professional fields, and users often obtain one-sided answers. (4) <strong>Low explainability and credibility</strong>: The existing AI decision-making process is like a black box, and it is difficult for users and developers to understand the basis of the model to give answers, especially in scenarios that require rigorous and transparent requirements such as education and government affairs, which has become a bottleneck in promotion. The above pain points lead to poor user experience and limited teaching effect, which restricts the in-depth application of intelligent services in scenarios such as Wisdom education, <strong>intelligent customer service</strong>, and <strong>government affairs consulting. This project locates the above problems, proposes to introduce the concept of artificial consciousness, and breaks through the existing bottlenecks through the purpose-driven deep semantic modeling and cognitive feedback closed-loop mechanism, so as to provide more intelligent, efficient and credible solutions for related industries.</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"3-Technical-solutions-and-architecture\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-Technical-solutions-and-architecture\" title=\"3. Technical solutions and architecture\"></a><strong>3. Technical solutions and architecture</strong></h1><p>The artificial consciousness service system constructed in this project takes the DIKWP cognitive model as the core framework, and divides the user interaction process into five semantic levels: data, information, knowledge, Wisdom, and Purpose, forming a complete link from perception to decision-making. The overall architecture of the system is as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Purpose recognition and user portrait:</strong> When a user asks a question or needs to learn, the system first uses natural language processing technology to parse the expression and identify the explicit and implicit purpose. Combined with the user's historical data and preferences, the DIKWP model portrait of the user is constructed, and the existing knowledge state and cognitive characteristics (such as the information that has been mastered, the current confusion points, etc.) are extracted. This step ensures that the system understands not only the \"what\" but also the \"why\" and \"what it is expected to achieve\".</p>\n<p><strong>Conceptual semantic transformation and semantic mathematical analysis</strong>: According to the identified user purpose and input content, the system uses semantic mathematical theory to convert the symbolic concept representation into DIKWP semantic space representation. Through the formal mapping method, the user's question or learning content is mapped to the data, information, knowledge and other typed resources, and the clear context semantics are given. This process ensures that the machine's understanding of the user's language is not limited to the literal symbolic level, but enters the semantic level that conforms to the user's context, so as to eliminate ambiguity and improve the accuracy of understanding. Semantic mathematics provides a rigorous system of semantic axioms, which makes concept transformation and reasoning evidence-based, and ensures semantic consistency and interpretability.</p>\n<p><strong>Knowledge Graph Reasoning and Wisdom</strong> Decision-making: After the semantic representation is completed, the system uses the data-information-knowledge graph three-way architecture to retrieve, associate and reason the content. Firstly, the entities and attributes involved in the original problem are matched on the data graph, and the basic data and its frequency characteristics are obtained. Then, the relationship between entities is tracked along the information graph, and relationship metrics such as interaction frequency are calculated to integrate relevant information. Then apply rules and background knowledge on the knowledge graph to make abstract inferences about the information to form a deeper understanding of the problem and possible answers. For example, for questions in educational scenarios, the data layer extracts the surface information, the information layer associates relevant knowledge points or prerequisite knowledge, and the knowledge layer combines the syllabus and cognitive rules to reason and complete the answers. On this basis, the system introduces the Wisdom**(W) layer for decision-making optimization, that is, comprehensively evaluates a variety of candidate answers or teaching strategies, and selects the scheme that best suits the user's purpose and cognitive level under the guidance of expert experience or strategy model. In the whole inference process, the user's Purpose** (P-layer) is also referred to to guide the knowledge search and selection to ensure that the output is consistent with the user's goal. This multi-level processing from data to Wisdom to Purpose realizes a cognitive computing framework that combines bottom-up perception and top-down adjustment: high-level Purpose and Wisdom can reverse guide the processing weight of underlying data and information to form a closed-loop optimization.</p>\n<p><strong>Response generation and interactive presentation</strong>: After inference decision-making, the system generates corresponding natural language answers or teaching content and pushes it to users. Answer generation is not only based on the content of the knowledge graph, but also integrates large-scale pre-trained language models (such as the DeepSeek series developed by the team) to ensure the fluency and richness of language expression. During the generation process, the system appends semantic annotations and source justification (e.g., citing knowledge base entries) to the answers to enhance the interpretability and credibility of the results. For teaching scenarios, the system can adjust the difficulty and style of the explanation in real time to make it both in line with the user's knowledge background and inspiring. Due to the introduction of emotional and cognitive features in user portraits, the system can also choose appropriate wording and interaction strategies for the user's possible emotional states (such as confusion and frustration), such as adding reassuring and encouraging sentences to improve the interaction experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Cognitive feedback and adaptive optimization</strong>: After the user receives the response, the system does not stop working, but continuously improves the service effect through the cognitive feedback mechanism. Specifically, the system captures the user's response to the interaction through a variety of means: such as analyzing follow-up questions or feedback questions to determine whether the user is satisfied with the answer, or evaluating the user's mastery of knowledge points through quizzes in teaching. If users are found to still have misunderstandings or knowledge blind spots, the system will trigger a new round of targeted coaching or explanations to achieve round-by-round refinement of human-machine dialogue. This adaptive feedback process benefits from the closed-loop design of the DIKWP model, where high-level Purpose Recognition is combined with Low-level data analysis: the system injects new feedback data into the user's DIKWP user model again, updates its knowledge and Purpose state, and makes targeted adjustments in the next interaction. For example, if it is detected that the user still does not understand a certain concept in teaching, the system will adjust the teaching strategy at the Wisdom layer (slow down the pace or change the teaching method), and reposition the user's goal at the Purpose layer (whether it needs to be a basic make-up lesson or give examples), so as to dynamically optimize the teaching plan. Through continuous cognitive feedback, the system can simulate the process of teaching teachers according to their aptitude, so that users can receive gradually optimized services every time they ask questions or learn.</p>\n<p><strong>XaaS modular deployment</strong>: The system adopts the cloud architecture design of \"Everything as a Service\", and each functional module (Purpose parsing, semantic transformation, knowledge graph reasoning, content generation, feedback analysis, etc.) provides standard interfaces in the form of microservices, which can be flexibly expanded and deployed on demand. Different application scenarios can selectively reuse the combination of related modules: for example, the education scenario focuses on the teaching strategy module and learner profiling, while the customer service scenario focuses on the domain knowledge base and sentiment analysis module. The whole system is easy to integrate into various business platforms through containerization and orchestration, and supports multiple deployment methods such as private cloud and public cloud, which is convenient for subsequent commercial promotion and large-scale application.</p>\n<p>In the above structure, each key technical link is supported by the team's years of research and development achievements. <strong>The DIKWP model and three-point graph architecture have been proposed in a number of patents. The conceptual space to semantic space conversion method has been studied and verified, which can effectively eliminate the difference in agent semantic understanding. Purpose-driven content generation improves the relevance and efficiency of human-machine communication; The closed-loop mechanism of cognitive feedback reflects the self-adjustment ability of the artificial consciousness system. The organic combination of these technologies constitutes a complete scheme of the artificial consciousness service system of this project.</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"4-Innovativeness-and-theoretical-breakthroughs\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-Innovativeness-and-theoretical-breakthroughs\" title=\"4. Innovativeness and theoretical breakthroughs\"></a><strong>4. Innovativeness and theoretical breakthroughs</strong></h1><p>Based on the original research of Professor Yucong Duan's team, this project has achieved a number of innovative breakthroughs in semantic modeling, cognitive assessment, and purpose control.</p>\n<p><strong>DIKWP cognitive model</strong>: Innovatively extends the classic DIKW (pyramid) model and introduces the Purpose layer on top of the data, information, knowledge, and Wisdom layers. This extension transforms cognitive processing from a reactive, data-driven to a proactive, goal-oriented process. The DIKWP model emphasizes the networked interaction and two-way regulation between various levels, and the high-level Purpose and Wisdom can guide the interpretation and screening of underlying data and information to form a closed-loop cognitive process. Compared with the traditional linear model, DIKWP is closer to the characteristics of human cognition, realizes the representation of \"purposefulness\" by the AI system, and lays the theoretical foundation for the framework of artificial consciousness.</p>\n<p><strong>Semantic Mathematics and Formal Semantic Representation</strong>: The project adopts the semantic mathematics theory independently developed by the team to introduce semantic explicit into the mathematical formal system. By constructing semantic axioms (such as existence, uniqueness, transitivity, etc.) and formal rules, the meaning carried by symbols is axiomatized. This breakthrough makes knowledge representation and reasoning not only stay at the level of symbolic operation, but also contain clear semantic constraints, realizing the synchronization of logical reasoning and semantic understanding. In similar studies, semantic factors are often implicit in artificially set ontologies or rules, while the semantic mathematical system makes each data and each theorem correspond to a clear semantic explanation. This provides a highly interpretable, rigorous and unified modeling method for knowledge graph and natural language understanding, and solves the long-standing problem of disconnection between formal logic and semantic expression.</p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Awareness White-box Assessment System</strong>: The team originally developed a white-box DIKWP assessment method to quantitatively evaluate the \"awareness\" and cognitive ability of large models. Compared with the traditional test that focuses on Q&amp;A performance, this evaluation system constructs a full-link index system covering four modules: perception and information processing, knowledge construction and reasoning, <strong>Wisdom application and problem solving, and purpose identification and adjustment. Through hundreds of customized test questions, the mainstream large language model is systematically analyzed, which can break through the traditional mode of focusing only on semantic understanding and reasoning, and analyze the cognition and decision-making process of the model in an all-round way</strong>。 This work has created a new dimension of AI cognitive assessment, and it has also fed back the development of the system of this project, which we have borrowed from the white-box evaluation indicators and integrated them into the system design, so that the processing process at all layers of the model can be transparent and monitorable. For example, for the Purpose Recognition module, we have developed an internal assessment similar to \"Purpose Understanding Accuracy\"; For the Wisdom decision-making module, evaluation such as \"solution rationality\" is introduced. The application of the white-box evaluation system ensures that the system can continuously optimize each cognitive module during the development process, and create an \"explainable and measurable\" artificial consciousness system benchmark.</p>\n<p><strong>Purpose-driven semantic communication and control</strong>: This project introduces a purpose-driven mechanism into AI human-computer interaction to realize the innovation of the system to dynamically adjust the communication content and decision-making strategy according to the multi-party purpose. Specifically, we adopt the theory of conceptual space → semantic space transformation to support the individualized semantic alignment between agents according to their respective DIKWP contexts. Different from traditional communication methods that rely on shared static ontologies, our approach semantically augments and transforms the sender's content according to the receiver's DIKWP model, so as to customize the message that the receiver can easily understand and conform to its cognitive background. This kind of purpose perception and content adaptation significantly reduces misunderstandings in human-computer communication. For example, in the customer service scenario, the system will balance the purpose of the user and the service provider: it not only meets the needs of the user's problem, but also takes into account the service specifications of the enterprise, so as to achieve the dynamic balance of the three-party purpose, so as to provide interactive results that are more in line with the user's needs at a lower cost. For example, CN113810480A proposed an emotional communication method based on DIKW content objects, which typed the sent content and converted it according to the receiver's graph, so that the sender's purpose could be more appropriately expressed and the understanding error would be reduced. Drawing on this idea, this system enables AI to perceive and respond to users' implied purpose and emotions in real time, and truly realize user-centered intelligent services.</p>\n<p>In summary, this project theoretically integrates cutting-edge achievements in the fields of cognitive science, semantic web, and artificial intelligence, and forms a unique technical system: semantic modeling for intrinsic purpose, interpretable cognitive evaluation criteria, and dynamic purpose-driven control. This is the first of its kind at home and abroad, and it is expected to drive the paradigm shift of AI from a \"black box tool\" to a \"conscious service body\".</p>\n<h1 id=\"5-Application-Scenarios-and-Values\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#5-Application-Scenarios-and-Values\" title=\"5. Application Scenarios and Values\"></a><strong>5. Application Scenarios and Values</strong></h1><p>The purpose-driven artificial consciousness service system built in this project has universal modular capabilities, which can be widely used in multiple scenarios and create significant value for various industries:</p>\n<p><strong>Wisdom Education</strong>: In the field of education, the system can act as an intelligent personality mentor. By modeling students' purpose and cognitive state, we provide interactive teaching services that teach students according to their aptitude. For example, when students ask questions during the learning process, the system not only gives answers, but also tracks students' mastery of knowledge points, and adjusts the depth of explanations or the difficulty of practice questions in a timely manner. For confusion in learning, the system can detect students' emotional frustration and give encouragement or hints to prevent them from losing motivation to learn. Compared with traditional \"one-size-fits-all\" online courses, this system allows each student to enjoy tailor-made tutoring to enhance learning efficiency and learning experience. At the same time, teachers can also use the system to automatically generate personalized learning reports to understand students' weak links, so as to carry out targeted offline tutoring and realize human-machine collaborative Wisdom teaching.</p>\n<p><strong>Intelligent customer</strong> service: In the field of enterprise customer service and customer experience, this system can be deployed as an intelligent customer service assistant. Using Purpose Recognition and Sentiment Analysis, the system can quickly understand the real demands behind the questions raised by customers (such as consultations, complaints, or purchase intentions), and invoke the knowledge graph to provide accurate and contextual responses. In the process of dialogue, the system adjusts the response strategy according to the customer's response: for the unsatisfactory response, the system further retrieves information or changes the expression mode through the cognitive feedback mechanism; For emotionally charged customers, the system will switch to reassuring mode or transfer the conversation to a human agent in a timely manner when it recognizes negative emotion. Thanks to its self-learning capabilities, the system can also continuously enrich the knowledge base and conversation strategies from historical customer service records. The application of this solution can significantly reduce the labor cost of enterprise customer service, improve response speed and customer satisfaction, and inject new vitality into scenarios such as Wisdom business hall and e-commerce customer service.</p>\n<p><strong>Government cognitive service</strong>: In government public service and decision support scenarios, the artificial awareness system can play a role as a government cognitive assistant. Faced with a large amount of information about policies, regulations and procedures, it is often difficult for the public to obtain the answers they need in a timely manner. The system provides accurate and detailed policy consulting services for citizens through the built-in authoritative government knowledge graph (covering policy documents, service guides, etc.) and the purpose-driven Q&amp;A engine. For example, when a citizen asks for the materials needed to do something, the system not only lists them, but also automatically adjusts the focus of the answer according to the identity of the questioner (individual/enterprise), and asks for the default information to give customized guidance. Within the government, decision-makers can use the system to conduct data analysis and assist decision-making: the system can understand the governance goals that leaders are concerned about, extract useful information and knowledge from scattered government data, and form decision-making suggestions or risk early warning reports. Through the introduction of artificial awareness system, <strong>digital government will be more intelligent and humane, improving the efficiency of public services and scientific decision-making.</strong></p>\n<p>In addition, the technology of this project can also be extended to medical and health care (intelligent consultation and health advisory), <strong>financial consulting</strong> (intelligent investment advisory, risk assessment), and <strong>industrial operation and maintenance</strong>(intelligent fault diagnosis system) and other fields. All scenarios that require human-computer cognitive interaction can be driven by the purpose drive and cognitive feedback capabilities of the system to improve the quality of interaction and intelligence. For example, in medical scenarios, the system can be used as a doctor's assistant to analyze the symptoms described by the patient, give diagnostic suggestions based on the medical knowledge graph, and provide reminders and verification for the doctor's decision-making, so as to build a safe and controllable intelligent diagnosis and treatment model. In summary, the value of this project in various application fields is reflected in the following: improving the accuracy of information acquisition and decision-making, the naturalness and personalization of human-computer interaction, the credibility and explainability of system operation, and ultimately promoting the intelligent upgrading of the industry and the significant improvement of user experience.</p>\n<h1 id=\"6-Landing-foundation-and-technical-feasibility\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#6-Landing-foundation-and-technical-feasibility\" title=\"6. Landing foundation and technical feasibility\"></a><strong>6. Landing foundation and technical feasibility</strong></h1><p>This project has a solid R&amp;D foundation and landing feasibility. <strong>In terms of technical prototypes, the team has developed a prototype system for core modules. For example, in the Wisdom education scenario, we built a prototype of intelligent teaching Q&amp;A, which realized the functions of textbook Q&amp;A and learning progress tracking based on knowledge graph. In terms of cognitive assessment of large language models, we released the Deepseek series of large models and their awareness level evaluation reports, which verified the effectiveness of the DIKWP system in cognitive analysis. These prototypes provide direct experience in building a complete system for a project.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In terms of data and knowledge base, the team has accumulated a large number of data resources and knowledge graph construction experience in vertical fields. Taking the field of education as an example, we have built a knowledge graph covering the main subjects of primary and secondary schools, including the association of tens of thousands of nodes of concepts and exercises, as the support of personalized teaching modules. In the field of customer service, we have compiled the FAQ corpus and product knowledge base of an e-commerce platform to train and test the purpose recognition and response accuracy of the customer service robot. This pilot data provides the initial training and validation basis for the system, making the implementation of customized applications more feasible.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In terms of patent technology transformation, the project benefited from a number of invention patents that have been authorized by the team as theoretical and engineering support. For example, the \"Semantic Modeling and Abstraction Enhancement Method of Three-layer Graph Framework\" proposed by the patent CN107038262B has been transformed and applied in our knowledge graph module for dynamic abstraction and improvement of knowledge structure. The \"Whole Life Cycle Assessment Method of Software System Based on DIKWP Model\" proposed by the patent CN114356770A was used as a reference to monitor the performance bottlenecks and optimization directions of each stage of system development. The patent CN113810480A \"Emotional Communication Method for DIKW Content Objects\" directly supports the design of the human-computer emotional interaction unit of the system. In addition, the team's patent achievements in privacy protection, blockchain and other directions (such as the application of DIKWP in privacy resource modeling and user purpose identification) also provide a guarantee for the security and scalability of the system. Such a combination of production and research ensures the advancement and reliability of the project technology - the maturity of the patent results proves the feasibility of the plan, and the authorization of the patent also lays the intellectual property foundation for future commercial promotion.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In terms of team ability, we have an interdisciplinary R&amp;D team and perfect experimental conditions. The core technical personnel have an in-depth understanding of the DIKWP model and semantic intelligence technology, have participated in a number of related topics and system development, and have a plan to deal with possible engineering challenges (such as large-scale knowledge graph concurrent query, real-time purpose computing performance, etc.). At the same time, the team is equipped with a high-performance computing center and a cloud service platform, which can provide necessary computing power support and development and testing environment for this project.

Future planning and commercialization scenarios\"></a><strong>8. Future planning and commercialization scenarios</strong></h1><p>In terms of future planning, the team will gradually promote technology improvement, scenario expansion and business transformation:</p>\n<p><strong>Technology Deepening and Iteration</strong>: In the next stage, we will focus on improving system performance and functional completeness. On the one hand, we continue to optimize the recognition accuracy and response speed of Purpose, and introduce methods such as larger-scale pre-trained models and reinforcement learning to make the system's understanding of complex Purpose more accurate and the contextual memory of multi-round conversations more durable. On the other hand, the cognitive feedback mechanism should be enriched, such as combining multimodal perception (camera captures facial expressions, physiological sensing, etc.) to more comprehensively evaluate the user's cognitive state, so as to improve the reliability of feedback. We also plan to further engineer the semantic mathematics and knowledge reasoning modules to enhance the inference efficiency of the system under a large-scale knowledge base. At the same time, it actively participates in the standardization of artificial intelligence, and incorporates DIKWP models and white-box evaluation indicators into industry standard proposals to consolidate its leading position in technology.</p>\n<p><strong>Pilot application expansion</strong>: On the basis of mature technology, we plan to cooperate with leading users in various fields to carry out pilot projects. The short-term goal is to cooperate with some schools or online education platforms to deploy the teaching and tutoring module of the system in the field of Wisdom education to verify its effect on improving student achievement and engagement. In the field of government services, one or two city government units were selected to trial run the intelligent consulting assistant to collect feedback from the public. Through these pilots, we will gain valuable real-world application data to further refine our products and make them more relevant to our business needs.

First of all, we plan to build the system into a general artificial awareness service platform, which will be open to B-end customers using a subscription system or a cloud service (XaaS) model that charges by the number of calls. Educational institutions, enterprise customer service centers, government 12345 hotlines, etc., can connect the system to their business processes through APIs to achieve low-threshold use. Secondly, for the needs of specific industries, we will launch customized solutions to provide privatized deployment services that are more suitable for the industry through secondary development to obtain project income. In addition, with the team's patents and technical reserves, we are also considering incubating start-up companies or joint ventures with existing leading enterprises for product operation. For example, we have partnered with a well-known edtech company to launch an \"AI Personalized Tutor\" application, or partnered with a cloud service provider to embed our intelligent customer service engine into their SaaS product system. At the same time, we will actively strive for special government funds and industrial investment to help the rapid growth of the project. In the process of business promotion, we attach great importance to data security and ethics, and ensure that the system complies with relevant laws and regulations (such as education and privacy protection regulations, etc.) to gain the trust of users and regulators.</p>\n<p><strong>Outlook for social benefits</strong>: From a more macro perspective, this project is in line with the country's strategic direction for the independent innovation and application of a new generation of artificial intelligence technology.

On the one hand, the number of criminals involved in organized crime and vice, as well as those who endanger national security, has increased, and their strong organization and will to resist and reform have brought high risks to supervision. On the other hand, many prison police teams are gradually aging, and it is difficult to pay attention to the dynamic changes of each convict in a timely manner under the overload of management tasks. There are lags and omissions in the traditional manual supervision method, and there is an urgent need to improve the timeliness and accuracy of supervision with the help of artificial intelligence technology. Based on this background, the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom - Purpose (DIKWP) artificial intelligence model and related patented technologies are introduced to build an intelligent reminder system, which can assist the police to monitor and warn criminals of dangerous behaviors and psychological states in real time, and escort prison safety and criminal correction.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Construction-goals\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Construction-goals\" title=\"Construction goals\"></a><strong>Construction goals</strong></h1><p>The aim of this project is to develop and deploy an intelligent alert system that integrates into the existing prison management platform to achieve the following two goals:</p>\n<p> <strong>Real-time intelligent reminder of the danger of criminals</strong>: AI is used to analyze data such as the progress of the criminal's sentence, recent life events, reform performance, and changes in behavior patterns, and real-time reminders of which criminals currently exist in real danger or potential risks to the prison police, and assist in preventing and warning emergencies.</p>\n<p> <strong>Real-time intelligent reminders for psychological correction of convicts</strong>: Based on the convict's psychological assessment report, psychological counseling records, and the implementation of personalized correctional treatment plans, etc., intelligently identify changes in the psychological state of convicts, and remind psychological corrections police to promptly pay attention to individuals who need key interventions, to prevent psychological crises and improve the effectiveness of corrections.</p>\n<p>Through the realization of the above goals, the burden of daily supervision and psychological counseling of front-line police will be reduced, the initiative and refinement level of prison management will be improved, and a safe, stable and intelligent supervision environment will be built.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Functional-requirements-analysis\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Functional-requirements-analysis\" title=\"Functional requirements analysis\"></a><strong>Functional requirements analysis</strong></h1><p>According to the business needs of prison management and the above objectives, the system needs to have the following main functions:</p>\n<p> <strong>Intelligent early warning of dangerous behaviors</strong>: Comprehensive analysis of multi-dimensional data such as basic information of criminals (length of sentence, name of crime, labels related to crime and vice, etc.), recent major life events (such as receipt of judgments, family changes, imprisonment of accomplices, etc.), reform performance (reward and punishment records, violations of rules and disciplines), daily behavior and social networks (interactions with other prisoners, signs of gangs), and changes in physiological and psychological states (mood swings, abnormal behaviors) and other multi-dimensional data, to assess the dangerous tendencies of each criminal. When a criminal is judged to be at risk of potential violent conflict, escape, self-harm, or inciting disturbances, the system should send an early warning reminder to the police on duty in real time, indicating the type of risk and the factors on which it is based, to help the police take preventive measures.</p>\n<p> <strong>Psychological correction attention reminder</strong>: For the police in the psychological center, the system needs to track and monitor the mental health and correction progress of each convict, including regular psychological assessment scores, daily psychological counseling records, psychological crisis events (such as impulsiveness, self-harm tendencies), and the completion of their personal correction plans. When it is discovered that the convict's psychological state has deteriorated (such as an increase in depression index), relapsed into a negative psychological pattern, or has not participated in psychological correction activities as planned, the system promptly reminds the psychological police to pay attention to it and recommends possible interventions. For example, if a criminal is depressed recently and has poor sleep, it is recommended to arrange an in-depth psychological counseling.</p>\n<p> <strong>Personalized reminder mechanism</strong>: The system reminder should be personalized and scenario-based according to the situation of different criminals. The same incident has different degrees of impact on different criminals in different situations, and the reminder strategy should be dynamically adjusted. The system needs to support different reminder methods for different risk levels (such as general concern, key warning, and emergency alarm), and allow continuous optimization of reminder rules based on feedback from the police to avoid excessive disturbance or omission of important information, and realize automatic adjustment and personalized intelligent reminders.</p>\n<p> <strong>Information Visualization and Reporting</strong> (optional): Provides an intuitive interface for police officers to view a prison-wide overview of the risk landscape and mental health. For example, the current list of high-risk offenders, risk ratings, and statistics of recent early warning events can be displayed through the dashboard. Regularly generate reports to summarize the risk change trend and the progress of psychological correction work in each prison area, etc., to assist in management decision-making.</p>\n<p>The above functional requirements will be realized in the technical solution through the combination of DIKWP intelligent model and the patented \"intelligent reminder mechanism for scenes, events, people and purpose matching\" (CN110969420A). The system design will ensure seamless integration with existing prison information systems and strict adherence to data privacy and security norms.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Overview-of-technical-solutions\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Overview-of-technical-solutions\" title=\"Overview of technical solutions\"></a><strong>Overview of technical solutions</strong></h1><h2 id=\"Overview-of-the-DIKWP-model-and-the-intelligent-reminder-mechanism\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Overview-of-the-DIKWP-model-and-the-intelligent-reminder-mechanism\" title=\"Overview of the DIKWP model and the intelligent reminder mechanism\"></a><strong>Overview of the DIKWP model and the intelligent reminder mechanism</strong></h2><p>In this scheme, the DIKWP cognitive model proposed by Prof. Yucong Duan is used as the theoretical basis for system intelligence analysis. DIKWP is an extension of the traditional Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) model by adding a \"Purpose/Purpose\" element at the top level. This allows the system to not only distill information, knowledge, and wisdom decisions at a step-by-step basis when processing criminal-related data, but also to introduce a goal-oriented <strong>purpose</strong> to guide the entire analysis process. For example, the core purpose of the system is to \"ensure prison safety and improve the effectiveness of correction\", which will run through all aspects of data processing to ensure that the final reminder results are consistent with prison management goals.</p>\n<p>Different from the traditional linear hierarchy, the DIKWP model adopts a network interaction structure, and the information between the layers can flow in both directions and be iteratively updated. This means that the system not only obtains knowledge and wisdom from the data layer, but also influences the data collection and analysis at the lower level based on the high-level strategy (Purpose), so as to achieve a dynamic feedback loop. Specifically, when analyzing the risk of criminals, the system will continuously adjust the underlying model parameters according to the actual feedback (such as the results of police handling and the effect of psychological counseling), so that the reminder mechanism becomes more and more accurate. This \"DIKWP×DIKWP\" interaction model will be embodied in the fact that there is a set of cognitive processing chain from data to purpose within the system, and at the same time, the system and police users also form another set of cognitive interaction chain. The system provides Wisdom decisions (reminders) to users, and users take actions and feedback the results into the system as new data, thus forming a two-way iterative closed-loop intelligent processing.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we will integrate the intelligent reminder mechanism of \"matching scenes, events, characters and purposes\" described in the patent No. CN110969420A to integrate multi-dimensional context information into the reminder logic. This mechanism emphasizes the comprehensive consideration of scene factors (time and place) and participation factors (events, people, and purpose) when reminding decision-making, and realizes the automatic adjustment of reminder intensity through machine learning. This program will draw on the mathematical model and adjustment strategy in the patent, so that the system can generate appropriate reminders at the appropriate time and in an appropriate way according to the behavioral and psychological conditions of different criminals in special prison scenarios. For example, in the middle of the night or during sensitive hours, the system increases the sensitivity of risk alerts; In the daily routine scenario, reduce the frequency of unnecessary reminders. For example, for criminal offenders or those who are emotionally unstable, the warning level triggered by the same event will be higher than that of ordinary offenders. With this scenario-based and personalized matching, false negatives and false positives are minimized.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-overall-architecture-of-the-system\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#The-overall-architecture-of-the-system\" title=\"The overall architecture of the system\"></a><strong>The overall architecture of the system</strong></h2><p>The system is designed with a modular hierarchical architecture and operates as an embedded intelligent reminder module for the existing prison management system. The overall architecture can be divided into a data layer, a business logic layer (analysis and decision-making layer) and a presentation layer, and is run through the DIKWP model. The main components are as follows:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Data &amp; Information:</strong> responsible for the collection, access and preprocessing of various raw data. The data sources include: (1) the basic information database of criminals (sentence, crime type, organizational relationship, etc.); (2) Transform the performance database (reward and punishment records, labor/academic performance, violation of rules and disciplines, etc.); (3) data from psychological assessment and counseling systems (psychometric test scores, counseling notes, mental health records); (4) Monitoring and daily event collection (surveillance video analysis results, prison guard log records, emergency reports); (5) Other relevant data sources (such as meeting records, communication monitoring data, etc.). The data layer cleans, structures, and fuses these heterogeneous data into a standard information format for analysis. For example, the continuous monitoring observation notes are summarized into behavioral event entries, and the psychological counselor's text records are extracted from emotional labels and keyword information. The data layer also establishes a data update interface to realize real-time collection and triggering of new events to ensure the timeliness of analysis.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Knowledge &amp; Wisdom:</strong> This is the core of the system's intelligent analysis and decision-making, using the knowledge and wisdom layer capabilities of the DIKWP model. Firstly, the risk and psychological knowledge graph of criminals is constructed, and the entities such as personal attributes, relationship networks, events and states of criminals are represented in the form of nodes, and the correlation relationships are represented by edges to form a network knowledge structure. The knowledge graph fusion synchronously carries the multi-dimensional factors in the patent mechanism: the scene nodes include time (day and night shifts, special holidays, approaching the end of sentence, etc.) and location (prisons, wind fields, labor workshops, etc.); Event nodes include rewards and punishments, conflicts and disputes, family meetings, etc.; Character nodes include the convict himself, his co-defendants, co-inmates, police officers and other related roles; The Purpose node indicates possible motivational tendencies (such as revenge, suicide, escape attempts, or a desire to rehabilitate). The system transforms the information of the data layer into structured knowledge through the knowledge graph, and uses the graph database to achieve efficient correlation query and reasoning. Secondly, on the basis of knowledge graph and rule model, an intelligent inference engine is developed. The engine adopts the method of rule reasoning combined with machine learning: several built-in risk assessment rules and psychological early warning rules (formulated by senior police officers and psychological experts, such as \"if criminal A violates the law twice in the past 1 month and is close to completing his sentence, the risk of escape increases\"), etc.), and at the same time, machine learning models are introduced to predict complex patterns (such as dangerous behavior prediction models and <strong>psychological crisis prediction models trained based on historical data</strong>). When the inference engine obtains new data or an event is triggered, it synthesizes the rule inference and model calculation results to produce the corresponding <strong>Wisdom decision</strong>—that is, whether to need a reminder, what to remind, and how urgent it is.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Purpose Layer and Decision Feedback (Purpose):</strong> At the top level of the DIKWP architecture, the system defines a clear decision-making purpose, that is, the core goal of \"ensuring regulatory safety and promoting educational transformation\". The Purpose layer strategically filters and optimizes the preliminary results output by the inference engine to match the overall prison management purpose. For example, for each item to be reminded, the Purpose layer judges its consistency and priority with the system goal according to the preset policy - if a risk reminder helps prevent major security incidents and is urgent, it will be firmly enforced; If a psychological reminder can be postponed under the current police tension, the reminder can be postponed or combined. For example, if a certain type of reminder is often ignored or marked as invalid by the police, it may indicate that it does not meet the actual needs, and the system will reduce its trigger sensitivity; On the other hand, if an unforewarned emergency occurs, the precursor information is analyzed to update the rule base, reflecting the purpose-oriented optimization of \"starting with the end in mind\".</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Presentation: The</strong> system presents the reminder results to the prison administrator through a friendly interface. As the programme is integrated with the existing management system, the UI layer can be an extension of the existing civilian police work platform. For example, in the criminal information management interface used by the police on a daily basis, a \"smart reminder\" column or pop-up window is added to highlight it when there is a new high-risk warning. At the same time, it provides a query and analysis interface, allowing users to view the risk assessment details and psychological state curves (data visualization) of individual criminals, as well as global risk heat maps, statistical reports, etc. (if visualization function is implemented). The UI layer also includes a configuration management interface for system administrators to adjust the parameters of the alert mechanism (such as thresholds for different risk levels), what types of alerts to subscribe to, and data rights management settings.</p>\n<p>The above architecture is embedded in the existing system through loose coupling: the data layer is connected to the prison database and business system through interfaces; The inference engine runs in real time as a background service and writes the results to the reminder notification table. The front-end interface invokes the data provided by the new module or microservice in the existing system. The entire architecture ensures that data is not leaked externally, the processing process is safe and controllable, and the scalability is strong to facilitate future function upgrades.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Key-technology-implementation-details\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Key-technology-implementation-details\" title=\"Key technology implementation details\"></a><strong>Key technology implementation details</strong></h2><p><strong>1. Scene, event, and person are integrated with the reminder mechanism that matches the purpose</strong></p>\n<p>The intelligent reminder logic at the core of this system will be strictly combined with the multi-dimensional matching mechanism proposed by CN110969420A patent. These include:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Multi-dimensional factor modeling</strong>: According to the patented method, the factors influencing the reminder decision are divided into two categories: scenario factors and participation factors. Scene factors include both temporal and spatial dimensions. In this system, the time dimension is refined into daily work and rest time period (such as day/night, weekday/weekend), major time nodes (approaching the end of sentence, early stage of detention, anniversary of the crime, etc.), and the spatial dimension refers to the current environment of the convict (prison, release area, interview room, labor post, etc.). Participation factors include the event dimension (the type of event the offender is currently experiencing, such as being punished, being granted a commutation, and having a dispute), the person dimension (the person involved, such as a cell member, a member of a hostile gang, family visits, etc.), and the purpose dimension (a presumed subjective purpose, such as whether there is a tendency to violence, self-harm, escape attempts, or other psychological motives). The data for these dimensions is underpinned by the aforementioned data layers and knowledge graphs.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Reminder Significance Calculation</strong>: Drawing on the formula model in patents, design an algorithm to calculate the \"Reminder Significance\" or risk score. First, the scene saliency SIG_SC = α * SC_T + β * SC_P. Among them, SC_T and SC_P represent the importance scores of the current time and place factors, respectively, and α and β are weighted (which can be adjusted and optimized according to historical data). For example, late at night and in a prison cell, both SC_T and SC_P may be given high values, as violent clashes are more harmful at night. Then, the significance SIG_PT of the participating factors is calculated, and the three factors of event, person, and purpose are combined with the scene factor, and the formula is similar to SIG_PT = m * PT_E * SIG_SC + n * PT_R * SIG_SC + k * PT_I * SIG_SC (where PT_E, PT_R, and PT_I represent the parameter values extracted from the event, person, and purpose factors, respectively, and m, n, and k are the corresponding weights). With this formula, the system dynamically adjusts the final reminder intensity. For example, if the current scene SIG_SC is very high (indicating that time and space are sensitive), and the incident is a fight (PT_E high), the person involved is the backbone of the underworld (PT_R high), and the purpose is judged to have a tendency to retaliate (PT_I high), then the calculated reminder will have a very high significance, and the system will trigger a high-level alarm to notify the on-duty leader and police reinforcements. On the other hand, if the scene is general and the event/person has little impact, it may only produce a low-level prompt for the police in the prison district to know.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Purpose Identification and Privacy Protection</strong>: For the acquisition of \"Purpose\" factors, the system uses natural language processing and behavior analysis technology to extract emotional tendencies and potential Purpose from the words and deeds of criminals. However, in order to comply with the principles of data privacy, we use the same strategy as the patent mechanism: <strong>only the propensity is judged, and the specific content is not</strong> touched. For example, when analyzing the letters or phone calls of criminals to their families, only the emotional polarity (positive/negative) and the frequency of stress words are extracted, but the specific conversation content is not spied on. Psychological counseling records also mainly identify changes in psychological status (such as being more anxious or calmer) and respect the privacy of communication. These extracted Purpose clues are quantified and calculated as PT_I input reminders. While protecting privacy, it can still allow the system to grasp the psychological dynamics of criminals and use them to assist in judgment.</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Machine Learning Adaptive</strong> Tuning: The patent mentions that alert parameters are continuously modified by introducing big data interfaces and user behavior learning. The system will achieve this: the initial parameters of α, β, m, n, k, etc., can be trained on a large amount of historical prison event data to obtain default values. After the system is put into operation, it will continuously monitor the effect of reminders (such as the feedback of the police on the reminders and the actual unwarned events), and use online learning or regular offline training to update the model. For example, if the risk is found to be underestimated in certain scenarios, the system will automatically increase the SIG_SC or relevant weights under similar conditions. If a certain type of alert is statistically proven to be a false positive, the weight of its parameters is reduced accordingly. In this way, the reminder mechanism will become more and more relevant to the actual situation of the prison, forming a closed-loop Wisdom optimization chain.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Intelligent reminder module of criminal danger</strong></p>\n<p>The module focuses on monitoring the unsafe behavior and signs of events of criminals, assessing the danger level in real time and issuing early warnings. Its implementations include:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Risk Feature Extraction</strong>: The system builds a risk profile for each offender, including static and dynamic features. Static characteristics such as the length of the sentence (the closer the sentence expires, there may be a risk of all-or-nothing), the nature of the case (the basic risk of violent offenders is higher), organizational relationship (the potential risk of collusion among gang members), past violation history, etc. Dynamic characteristics such as: recent behavioral events (fighting, indiscipline, incitement to others, etc.), emotional state (derived from daily observation and NLP analysis of chat content), social network changes (whether there is frequent contact with certain sensitive people), etc. The system continuously fetches and updates these characteristics from the data layer.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Risk assessment model</strong>: The above characteristics are used to input a comprehensive risk assessment model for scoring. The model is composed of a rule engine + machine learning: the rules section defines some high-risk models based on expert knowledge, such as \"short sentence + recent frustration = &gt; high risk of self-harm\" or \"terrorists + contact with sensitive areas = &gt; possibility of premeditated violence\", and the risk score is increased if the conditions are met. The machine learning part can use classification or predictive models (such as random forests, graph neural networks, etc.) to make risk predictions on complex feature combinations based on large-scale historical data training. This is where the knowledge graph comes into play, and indirect risk factors can be deduced (e.g., A and B often conspire and B has planned a riot, then A is also at high risk). The model outputs the current risk level (e.g., 1-5 or low, medium, high) and the main risk factors for each offender.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Real-time trigger and notification</strong>: When the risk level reaches the preset threshold, the module generates a danger reminder event. Different reminder methods are adopted according to the severity of the risk: the general risk can be marked with a yellow alert on the system interface; If the risk is high, the red will be highlighted and an audible/SMS reminder will be triggered to notify the police on duty; In the case of an extreme emergency (e.g., when imminent violence is anticipated), the police are linked to the prison emergency response plan (e.g., broadcasting an alarm and notifying the command center). The content of the reminder includes the name of the convict, the prison area where he is located, a description of the risk type, and a description of relevant indicators (for example, \"I have had frequent contact with X recently, and I am suspected of planning a crowd fight\"), so that the police can quickly understand the situation. All reminder events will also be logged for later analysis and verification.</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Linkage disposal and feedback</strong>: After receiving the reminder, the police can confirm and fill in the disposition situation through the system interface (such as conducting conversation education, strengthening inspections, or reporting to leaders, etc.). These results are fed back to the system and stored in the data layer. On the one hand, the system will record which reminders have successfully prevented accidents and which have been confirmed to be false positives, so as to use them as annotated data in subsequent model optimization. On the other hand, the knowledge graph is also updated with the disposal results, such as \"offender X was found to have signs of violation at time Y and has been warned in time\" will reduce his short-term risk score. This realizes closed-loop risk management - the system discovers risks, prompts intervention, human-machine collaborative disposal, and then corrects the system judgment according to the results.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Intelligent reminder module for criminal psychological correction</strong></p>\n<p>This module aims to assist psychological correction staff to grasp the changes in the mental health of offenders in a timely manner and ensure that correctional measures are targeted. Key implementation details include:</p>\n<p> <strong>Psychological state monitoring</strong>: The system establishes a psychological file for each offender, and collects information such as psychological assessment scale scores (such as depression, self-rated stress, irritable tendency, etc.), regular comments from psychological counselors, psychiatric diagnosis and treatment records (if any), and daily behavior (sleep, diet, social participation). In particular, some objective quantitative methods are introduced into the system: for example, the analysis of the emotional tendency of criminals to use words when writing letters to their families or talking to people over a period of time (NLP sentiment analysis); Monitor changes in daily routines (e.g., recently being left alone and not out of the cell, which may indicate social withdrawal). These data are processed and mapped into psychological state characteristics, such as \"increased depression potential\", \"moderate anxiety index\", \"low willingness to obey\", etc.</p>\n<p> <strong>Judgment of correction needs</strong>: Combined with each offender's individualized correction plan (which may include reform goals, frequency of psychological counseling, courses to be completed, etc.), the system determines whether the current psychological state deviates from the normal track and requires additional intervention. The implementation method is also a rule + model: at the rule level, several situations worth reminding are listed, such as: \"depression score &gt; 80 in two consecutive psychological assessments and is on the rise\" or \"missed the agreed psychological counseling and recently experienced family changes\", etc., and the match triggers the reminder. At the model level, a psychological crisis prediction model can be trained, and the above psychological characteristics can be input to output the probability of serious psychological problems. For high-risk individuals (if there is a suggestion of suicide with self-harm), the model gives a high alarm value.</p>\n<p> <strong>Reminder content and interaction</strong>: When it is determined that a criminal needs psychological attention, the system generates a psychological correction reminder. The target of the reminder is the police officer of the psychological center or the relevant counselor. The reminder can be a system message or email, and it will be highlighted on the interface of the psychological correction work platform. Include the offender's name, ward/number, an overview of the concerns (e.g., \"significant depressive mood\" or \"suspected recurrence of PTSD problems\"), and recommended initial measures (e.g., \"Recommend an individual counseling session within the week\" or \"Consider adjusting correctional goals\"). Suggested measures can be automatically generated according to the system's built-in knowledge base, which brings together corrective strategies and intervention methods formulated by psychologists to correspond to different psychological problems. After the police intervene, they can record the actual measures taken and feedback on the effects in the system.</p>\n<p> <strong>Tracking and evaluation</strong>: The system continuously tracks the subsequent changes in the mental state of the reminded subject. If the intervention is effective (e.g., the next time the depression index decreases), the system marks the case as successful and reinforces the strategy of using the same reminder for similar situations; If there is no improvement or even deterioration, the system flags the method in the knowledge base as potentially ineffective, prompting a psychologist to intervene to re-evaluate the orthodontic treatment plan. This continuous evaluation mechanism ensures that the quality of psychological correction reminders is continuously improved. In addition, the system can count the number and type of psychological warnings and the success rate of corrections on a monthly basis, providing a quantitative basis for management to improve resource allocation (e.g., investing more psychological counseling efforts in prisons with frequent warnings).</p>\n<p><strong>4. Security and privacy technology</strong></p>\n<p>In view of the sensitivity of prison data and strict security requirements, the system is designed with multiple layers of data security and privacy protection measures:</p>\n<p> <strong>Data access control</strong>: All modules of the system are deployed on the prison's internal network and follow the principle of least privilege to access data. Users with different roles (prison district police, psychological police, administrators, etc.) can only view and process information within the scope of their authority. For example, psychological correction data can only be accessed by authorized personnel of the psychological center, and ordinary supervision police do not have the right to view specific psychological reports, and can only receive prompts that need attention but do not have detailed privacy content. The system integrates with existing privilege systems through single sign-on to ensure that unauthorized data flow is not increased.</p>\n<p> <strong>Privacy-preserving design</strong>: As mentioned in the Purpose analysis section above, the system uses anonymization and generalization methods when processing data as much as possible. When it comes to the content analysis of calls and letters, the \"information\" layer data such as sentiment and keyword frequency is extracted, and the original full text is not stored, and the analysis process is completed in memory and the results are only saved in the form of labels or scores. In the psychological counseling record, if there is highly sensitive privacy (family background, criminal details, etc.), these fields are skipped during the system analysis and only focus on the content related to the psychological state. These practices are in line with the spirit of the patent's \"smart reminder with privacy in mind\". In addition, all personally sensitive fields are encrypted or hashed when stored in the database, so even if the underlying administrator directly reads the database table, the plaintext information cannot be easily obtained.</p>\n<p> <strong>Security protection and auditing</strong>: Necessary security protection measures are deployed in the system operating environment, including firewall isolation, intrusion detection, anti-virus, and measures to prevent adversarial sample attacks on AI models (to prevent criminals from deliberately disguising data to deceive the system). Important reminder operations and parameter changes are logged and regularly audited by the prison supervision department to ensure that the system behavior is compliant and transparent. If abnormal access or data leakage is suspected, the system can automatically alarm and block relevant functions in time. At the same time, the system is strengthened in accordance with the requirements of the national information security level protection to ensure the safety and reliability of the whole solution.</p>\n<h1 id=\"How-to-integrate-with-existing-systems\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#How-to-integrate-with-existing-systems\" title=\"How to integrate with existing systems\"></a><strong>How to integrate with existing systems</strong></h1><p>This solution emphasizes the function expansion without destroying the existing system architecture, and the specific integration ideas are as follows:</p>\n<p> <strong>Data layer integration</strong>: Obtain the required data from the existing prison management system through standard database connections, middleware message queues, or API interfaces. For example, the basic information and daily records of the offender are provided by the database of the original supervision system. Psychological assessment data are imported from the psychological counseling system; Monitoring alarms are received through the message push mechanism. The new system does not duplicate data sources, but uses existing data as a data consumer to achieve loose coupling. The implementation of the data interface will be developed in cooperation with the original system vendor to ensure that the data is synchronized in real time without affecting the performance of the original system.</p>\n<p> <strong>Business logic embedding</strong>: The smart alert engine can be deployed as a standalone microservice or module, integrated with the main system through service calls. When a new data event (such as a violation record) occurs, the main system calls the API of the reminder service to analyze and obtain whether the alert is generated and its level. Or the analysis is passively triggered by the reminder module subscribing to the main system message. The analysis results are stored in a shared alert result database, and the main system can query the alert information periodically or display the alert information on the original interface through a joint table query. For old systems that do not have a service-oriented architecture, they can also be integrated by embedding the analysis SDK library on their servers. In short, make sure that the new features are seamless for users: still use the familiar system, just with more smart alerts.</p>\n<p> <strong>Front-end interface integration</strong>: Utilize the UI framework of the original system to add necessary pages or controls. For example, add a column of \"Risk Level\" icons to the offender list page. Display the \"Smart Reminders\" module card on the personal details page to list the current reminders and historical alerts; Highlight the people you focus on in your counseling calendar. These front-end changes are implemented through front-end and back-end joint debugging, which is consistent with the style of the original system. Some of the new and complex interfaces, such as the Prison-wide Risk Posture Dashboard, are available as stand-alone menus for users with permissions. Through good UI/UX design, it is ensured that the police can get started without additional training and improve acceptance.</p>\n<p> <strong>System performance and scaling</strong>: Due to the inline integration, the new module needs to be optimized for performance and not slow down the main system. We can take advantage of mechanisms such as asynchronous processing, caching, and incremental updates. For example, most of the analysis is done asynchronously in the background, and the results are cached for front-end query. High-frequency and small data (such as daily behavior logs) are accumulated to a certain threshold and then processed in batches. The module adopts an extensible architecture, so if you need to upgrade AI algorithms or add new data sources in the future, you only need to replace or add corresponding services without affecting the whole. This protects existing investments and leaves room for long-term evolution.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Implement-the-plan-in-phases\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Implement-the-plan-in-phases\" title=\"Implement the plan in phases\"></a><strong>Implement the plan in phases</strong></h1><p>In order to build this intelligent reminder system smoothly and efficiently, the project will be carried out in the following stages:</p>\n<p><strong>The first stage: demand research and system design</strong> (about 2 months)<br/>in-depth investigation of the current situation of prison management, collect the needs of front-line police and psychological staff, and refine the functional list and indicator system. Analyze the data structure of the existing information system and formulate the data interface scheme. Set up a R&amp;D team to design the system architecture and technical route, including the DIKWP model application scheme and the details of the integration of the patent mechanism. Produce documents such as \"Project Requirements Specification\" and \"System Architecture Design Scheme\", which will be reviewed and confirmed by the prison management department.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2: Core module development and pilot verification</strong> (about 4 months)<br/>Develop the back-end logic of the two core modules, danger reminder and psychological reminder, including data interface adaptation, knowledge graph construction, rule engine and preliminary machine learning model training, reminder calculation algorithm (to implement patent formula), basic feedback mechanism, etc. At the same time, a simple test interface was developed for internal debugging. 1-2 prisons were selected as pilots, and the test version of the system was deployed to verify the real data. Through the pilot operation, the accuracy of the model and the effectiveness of the reminder are evaluated, user feedback is collected, and problems are found and corrected in time. The goal of this stage is to achieve the availability of core functions and the preliminary and reasonable effects of the main algorithm parameters.</p>\n<p><strong>The third stage: complete system development and integration</strong> (about 3 months)<br/>on the basis of the pilot, improve all functional modules of the system. Develop front-end interfaces and integrate with legacy systems; Implement security and access control modules; Optimize algorithm performance and stability. Write data visualization and report generation components, if needed. Complete the deployment of privacy protection measures (data encryption, log auditing). Cooperate with the original system supplier to complete the interface joint debugging test to ensure that the new and old systems work together correctly. Conduct full-process functional testing, performance testing, and security penetration testing to fix all issues found.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 4: Step-by-step deployment and personnel training</strong> (about 1 month)<br/>Develop a step-by-step go-live plan and gradually deploy the system to the province/national prison environment. It can be put into operation in several key pilot units first, and then implemented to other units after summarizing experience. Training is also carried out for different user groups: training for prison police on how to view and respond to intelligent reminders, training for psychological staff on how to use system insight to adjust correction methods, and training for system administrators on configuration management and troubleshooting. Collect suggestions from users for subsequent optimization.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 5: Operation Evaluation and Continuous Optimization</strong> (Long-term Continuity)<br/>After the system is launched, it will enter into daily operation and maintenance. Establish a regular evaluation mechanism, such as quarterly analysis of key indicators such as the accuracy rate of system early warnings, the proportion of incidents that cannot be detected in advance, and the success rate of psychological crisis intervention, and compare the evaluation benefits with the baseline data before the launch. Based on the results of the evaluation, the model and rule base are continuously improved, such as updating the algorithmic model to reduce false positives and false negatives. At the same time, we will pay close attention to emerging needs (such as adapting to new regulatory methods, introducing physiological data of wearable devices, etc.), and plan to include subsequent version upgrades to continuously improve the intelligence level of the system.</p>\n<p>Through the steady implementation of the above stages, the system functions are gradually implemented and effective, and the impact on the daily work of the prison is reduced. Agile and iterative methods are used in project management, and users are continuously communicated during the development process to ensure that the output meets actual needs.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Expected-results\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#Expected-results\" title=\"Expected results\"></a><strong>Expected results</strong></h1><p>After the completion and use of this technical solution, it will produce significant benefits in the field of prison management and convict correction:</p>\n<p> <strong>Improve safety prevention capabilities</strong>: The system realizes real-time early warning of high-risk behaviors, greatly reducing the probability of sudden violent incidents, prison escape attempts, and self-harm accidents. Once there are signs, the police can intervene and deal with them as soon as possible, and <strong>eliminate potential safety hazards in the bud</strong>. This will improve the overall security posture of the prison and reduce the number of vicious incidents and casualties caused by untimely early warning.</p>\n<p> <strong>Strengthen the effectiveness of reform and psychological correction</strong>: For criminals in need of psychological intervention, ensure timely discovery and guidance, so as to avoid the accumulation of psychological problems and even behavioral problems. Accurate reminders allow psychological resources to be optimally allocated, and the limited teachers' energy is used on those who need the most attention, so as to improve the success rate of correctional treatment and the quality of criminal reform. In the long run, the improvement of the mental health and rehabilitation attitude of inmates will help reduce the recidivism rate and maintain social security.</p>\n<p> <strong>Reduce the work pressure of the police</strong>: The intelligent reminder system acts as an \"auxiliary supervisor\" and \"psychological counselor\" for 7x24 hours, automatically analyzing massive information and prompting key points, greatly reducing the burden of repeated inspections and manual judgment of the police. The police can devote more energy to humanized law enforcement and individual assistance and education, rather than being tired of dealing with daily complicated information. Especially for the elderly police and the inexperienced, the system provides reliable decision-making support and improves work confidence and efficiency.</p>\n<p> <strong>Scientific decision-making and system upgrading</strong>: The large amount of data and analysis results accumulated by the system provide a basis for scientific decision-making in prison management. Managers can adjust their monitoring strategies based on the data reports, such as strengthening management measures for high-risk groups and improving correction plans for common psychological problems. This has led to a shift in prison management from experience-driven to data-driven. In addition, the introduction of the DIKWP artificial intelligence model and a number of patented technologies in this solution is an important practice for the upgrading of prison informatization from digital to intelligent, laying the foundation for the construction of a more comprehensive Wisdom prison system in the future.</p>\n<p>In short, the implementation of the intelligent reminder system will significantly improve the safety factor of prisons and the effectiveness of rehabilitation, and achieve the goals of \"prevention before they occur\" and \"precise correction\". At the same time, this solution strictly adheres to data security and privacy requirements to ensure that the application of technology does not generate new management risks. Through human-machine collaboration and intelligent empowerment, prison management will reach a new level.</p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#conclusion\" title=\"conclusion\"></a><strong>conclusion</strong></h1><p>This report proposes a complete and detailed technical solution, which combines **Professor Yucong Duan's DIKWP mesh cognitive model with his authorized patent \"Intelligent Reminder Mechanism for Matching Scenes, Events, Characters and Purposes\".**Organically combined, the solution ideas are given for the two major needs of offender risk control and psychological correction in prison management. Through the modular architecture design, the solution realizes the full mining and utilization of data, the correlation reasoning of knowledge and the generation of Wisdom decisions, which can be embedded in existing systems and form a closed-loop intelligent processing chain. On the implementation path, step-by-step phased steps are planned to reduce project risk and ensure final results. It is expected that after the system is put into use, it will effectively improve the proactive prevention ability of prison safety management, optimize the pertinence and timeliness of psychological correction, and set a benchmark for the modernization and wisdom of prison management. In the next step, we will promote the implementation of the plan under the guidance of relevant departments, continue to optimize and improve, and make it truly become the right-hand man of the prison police and an important technical support for maintaining the safety of supervision and the quality of rehabilitation.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

Under the dual pressure of limited manpower and increased risks, how to improve the security factor of prisons has become an urgent problem to be solved.</p>\n<p>With the development of the Internet of Things, big data, and artificial intelligence, the concept of \"<strong>Wisdom Prison</strong>\" came into being. Through the deployment of sensing equipment and intelligent analysis system, Wisdom Prison realizes comprehensive perception, intelligent research and judgment, and active early warning of the prison environment and detainees. Using AI technology to independently analyze massive monitoring data, potential safety hazards can be discovered in advance and timely warnings can be provided, assisting scientific decision-making, reducing risk factors, and improving regulatory efficiency. This is consistent with the direction of China's modernization of prison governance, and it is also an inevitable requirement of the current prison management work. In this context, <strong>it is of great significance to introduce an intelligent management scheme based on the mesh DIKWP model and the principle of artificial awareness</strong>: it will help build a safe, controllable, intelligent and adaptive prison management system, improve the quality and safety level of rehabilitation, and realize the modernization of prison governance capacity.</p>\n<h1 id=\"2-Construction-goals\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#2-Construction-goals\" title=\"2 Construction goals\"></a><strong>2 Construction goals</strong></h1><p>With the core goal of improving prison safety and the effectiveness of rehabilitation, this plan <strong>proposes intelligent functions around the two aspects of \"safety prevention</strong>\" and \"<strong>psychological correction</strong>\", so that prison management can shift from passive response to active prevention. The specific construction goals are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>2.1 Real-time intelligent reminder of the danger of criminals</strong>: AI is used to analyze the behavior and status of detainees in real time, <strong>intelligently judge potential risks</strong>, and alert the supervising police in a timely manner. The system will give a dynamic risk assessment for each offender, and automatically send an alert to the police officer on duty when a criminal has an actual or potential security threat (such as violent conflict, escape attempt, self-harm and suicide, etc.). This goal aims to move the traditional post-event handling forward to pre-warning, so that the police can intervene early to prevent problems before they occur, and greatly improve the safety factor of prisons.</p>\n<p><strong>2.2 Real-time intelligent reminders for convicts' psychological correction work</strong>: Through intelligent analysis of convicts' psychological assessment results, daily performance, and psychological counseling records, psychological <strong>abnormalities or correctional needs are discovered in real time</strong>and remind psychological correction personnel to pay attention. The system will track the mental health indicators and reform progress of the convict, and when it is found that a convict has accumulated negative emotions, psychological crises (such as depressive tendencies, increased aggression), or has not reached the goal of the correctional stage, it will promptly notify the psychological counselor or the education and reform police to take measures. This goal ensures that psychological correction work is targeted, prevents safety accidents caused by untimely intervention in psychological problems, and promotes the rehabilitation and rehabilitation of offenders.</p>\n<p>The above two goals complement each other: safety precautions focus on the early warning of external behavioral risks, and psychological correction reminders focus on the early warning of internal psychological changes. The two jointly build a dual line of defense of \"security + correction\" in smart prisons, realize the overall control of people, things and situations, and not only maintain the safety of supervision but also promote education and reform.</p>\n<h1 id=\"3-Functional-Requirements-Analysis\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#3-Functional-Requirements-Analysis\" title=\"3 Functional Requirements Analysis\"></a><strong>3 Functional Requirements Analysis</strong></h1><p>Focusing on the above goals, the system needs to meet the following functional requirements to ensure that the intelligent reminder mechanism is feasible and integrated into the daily workflow of the police.</p>\n<p><strong>3.1 Intelligent reminder function of security risks</strong>: The system should comprehensively analyze the multi-dimensional information of each criminal, automatically judge security risks, and remind the police on duty to focus on prevention. These include:</p>\n<p>l <strong>Sentence factor</strong>: Reminders are triggered according to the length of the offender's sentence and progress. For example, when the sentence is about to expire, remind to prevent escape attempts, and pay attention to psychological imbalance or impulsive behavior when the sentence is too long.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Important life events</strong>: monitor the impact of major events in the offender's personal life (such as the death of an immediate family member, marital changes, case progress, etc.) on his emotions and behaviors. Early warning when a negative event occurs that may trigger retaliation, psychosocial or extreme behavior.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Rehabilitation performance</strong>: Evaluate the performance changes of convicts in their daily rehabilitation, including performance in labor reform, compliance with prison regulations, and records of rewards and punishments. If a person has recently violated discipline frequently and his anti-reform sentiment has increased, the police officer should be reminded to strengthen discipline; On the contrary, if you are suddenly too \"active\", you should also be wary of pretending to deceive and deceive to reduce the sentence.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Abnormal behavior</strong>: real-time analysis of the data of the criminal's daily behavior and physiological state (such as positioning trajectory, contact with personnel, dynamics in the prison, heart rate and blood pressure, etc.). Identify potential hazards in the event of unusual patterns (e.g., frequent movement late at night, contact with suspicious people, emotional agitation, or drastic fluctuations in health indicators).</p>\n<p>l <strong>Real-time early warning</strong>: Based on the above factors, the current risk factor and cause explanation of each criminal are given, and the high-risk person is alerted in real time. The content of the reminder includes the identity of the offender, its location, the type of risk (such as the risk of fighting, the risk of self-harm, etc.), and the recommended measures to deal with it, so as to facilitate the rapid response of the police. Potential risks (which have not yet developed into a definite hazard) should also be brought to the attention by cue or marking.</p>\n<p><strong>3.2 Intelligent reminder function for psychological corrections</strong>: The system should be connected to prison psychological correction operations, to help psychological cadres understand the changes in the psychological state of criminals in a timely manner and adjust correction strategies. The main needs include:</p>\n<p>l <strong>Psychological test analysis: Integrate the data of psychological assessment and daily psychological testing of criminals in prison to automatically assess the level of mental health. For example, when the scores of depression scale and anxiety scale are abnormal, an early warning is generated, indicating the need for further intervention.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Psychological counseling record tracking: Integrate the conversation records and counseling notes between the counselor and the offender, and use natural language processing to identify negative tendencies or red flags (such as despair, suicidal thoughts or hostile emotions in speech). If a serious warning is found after a conversation, immediately alert the person in charge of the psychological center to the offender.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Progress of correctional goals: The system should track the completion of the individualized psychological correction plan and phased goals formulated for each offender. If a convict fails to meet the correction goals (e.g., attitude change, emotional control without improvement) for many consecutive times, the correctional staff is reminded to adjust the plan or strengthen counseling.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Key personnel identification: Combined with psychological assessment and daily behavior, list criminals with psychological crisis tendencies or serious disorders as key targets, mark them in the system, and regularly remind them of the frequency of re-evaluation. For those who may injure themselves or others, the warning level should be increased and the safety department should be synchronized.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Information feedback: After receiving the reminder, psychological correction personnel can record the measures taken and observation results through the system as a reference for follow-up AI evaluation. The system learns the effects of different interventions and continuously optimizes the accuracy of follow-up reminders.</strong></p>\n<p>Through the above functions, the system can realize <strong>all-round dynamic monitoring and intelligent reminder of the \"physiology-psychology\" of prison prisoners</strong>: it not only captures the signs of overt dangerous behaviors in a timely manner, but also has insight into the hidden psychological change trend, and finally assists the supervision and education personnel to take precise actions.</p>\n<h1 id=\"4-Technical-scheme-design\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-Technical-scheme-design\" title=\"4. Technical scheme design\"></a><strong>4. Technical scheme design</strong></h1><p>In order to achieve the above functional requirements, we propose a system architecture design based on the mesh <strong>DIKWP model</strong> and the principle of artificial consciousness. The solution integrates the principles of cognitive science into the AI system to achieve perception, decision-making and feedback capabilities similar to human consciousness, and provides reliable intelligent management support in complex prison scenarios.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-1-Theoretical-basis-the-network-DIKWP-model-and-the-principle-of-artificial-consciousness\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-1-Theoretical-basis-the-network-DIKWP-model-and-the-principle-of-artificial-consciousness\" title=\"4.1 Theoretical basis: the network DIKWP model and the principle of artificial consciousness\"></a><strong>4.1 Theoretical basis: the network DIKWP model and the principle of artificial consciousness</strong></h2><p><strong>DIKWP Model Cognitive System: The DIKWP model is a new generation of artificial intelligence cognitive framework proposed by Professor Yucong Duan, which adds a \"Purpose/Purpose\" layer on the basis of the traditional \"Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom\" pyramid model. The five levels are, in order, Data (D), Information (I), Knowledge (K), Wisdom (W), and Purpose. Unlike linear layering, the DIKWP model adopts a network structure</strong>, and the layers are not transmitted in one direction, but through two-way associations to form a semantic feedback network. High-level Wisdom and Purpose can have a counter-effect on low-level data and information processing, and low-level new information will also continuously update cognitive results, thus forming a multi-directional feedback and dynamic iterative cognitive closed loop. This structure ensures that a unified cognitive semantic space is formed within the AI system, and every step of the reasoning decision can be traced and explained at the semantic level.</p>\n<p>In the DIKWP model, the functional positioning of each layer is as follows:</p>\n<p>l <strong>Data layer (D): Perception of the acquisition and representation of raw data, including surveillance camera video streams, sensor signals, text records, etc. In this scheme, the data layer is responsible for collecting various raw data in the prison and providing basic materials for subsequent processing.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Information layer (I): Perform preliminary processing and feature extraction on the data, and transform the chaotic raw data into meaningful information. For example, the \"fight\" incident is identified through video analysis, and the keywords of the criminal's emotional changes are extracted through text analysis. The information layer outputs structured information entries (events, metrics, etc.) that reflect key details in the data.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Knowledge layer (K): Integrate information into a knowledge graph or rule base to form a comprehensive understanding of the environment and objects. The knowledge layer establishes the files and relationships about the offender, including personal background, social relationships, historical behavior, psychological characteristics and other knowledge. It is mentioned that the DIKWP model realizes two-way semantic feedback at all levels, which is reflected in the knowledge layer by integrating new information into the existing knowledge graph and modifying prior knowledge (for example, if a criminal's recent behavior deviates from the previous pattern, the knowledge layer adjusts its perception of danger accordingly). The knowledge layer also contains rules of expert experience, such as \"if a prisoner's emotions fluctuate violently due to the death of a family member, the risk factor will increase in the next week\", etc., which are used to assist decision-making.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Wisdom Layer (W): The advanced analysis and decision-making capabilities of the corresponding system, i.e., judgment and reasoning. The Wisdom layer is based on the comprehensive semantic understanding provided by the knowledge layer for deep reasoning, prediction, and decision-making. For example, taking into account the offender's current information and past knowledge, assessing his or her recent risk level, or giving a recommendation for psychological treatment. The Wisdom layer also uses machine learning models to make predictions about complex nonlinear relationships (e.g., training a model on historical data to predict the probability of violence). Different from traditional AI, the decision-making of the Wisdom layer under the DIKWP system can be explained, because each decision can be traced back to the basis of the knowledge and information layer, making the AI decision-making process transparent and auditable.</strong></p>\n<p>Purpose <strong>/Purpose Layer (P): This is the top layer unique to the DIKWP model, which represents the global goal, purpose, and value constraints of the system. The Purpose layer plays a role similar to human will in artificial intelligence, and is the driving force and constraint mechanism of the entire cognitive process. By embedding the purpose inside the model, AI not only becomes smarter, but also ensures that its behavior always serves predetermined value and security needs. The Purpose layer makes the whole DIKWP system form a closed-loop control: when the decision result of the Wisdom layer deviates from the intended purpose, the Purpose layer will feed this deviation back to the lower layer for adjustment (such as re-evaluating the weight of certain information or introducing new data), so as to modify the system behavior to make it consistent with the goal. In this scheme, the Purpose layer clarifies the core purpose of \"ensuring prison security and promoting the rehabilitation of criminals\", and the modules of the drive system work in coordination around this purpose. At the same time, when a decision is not aligned with the purpose, the Purpose layer can step in to adjust the parameters (e.g., reduce unnecessary reminders to reduce distractions, or increase sensitivity for security purposes).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Closed-loop principle of artificial consciousness: Artificial consciousness is to make AI systems have characteristics similar to human subjective consciousness, including autonomous perception of the environment, formation of internal purpose, making decisions, and learning self-adjustment from results. Drawing on the theory of artificial consciousness, this scheme designs a closed-loop process of perception-purpose-decision-action-feedback, so that the system has a certain degree of autonomy and self-regulation ability:</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Perception: Corresponding to the data layer and information layer, the system continuously obtains sensory inputs from the external environment (camera images, microphone sounds, sensor readings, etc.) and perceives key information. From the perspective of artificial consciousness, this step allows the AI to \"perceive\" the surrounding events and object states, which is equivalent to sensory functions such as vision and hearing.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Purpose (Intention): Subjective evaluation of the current situation and goal motivation are formed within the AI. Through the Purpose layer, the system connects pre-set goals (safety and correction) with perceived realities, which in turn generate motivation for the next action. For example, when it senses that \"offender A is agitated and approaching the forbidden area of the prison area\", the purpose layer generates a \"need for further monitoring/intervention A\" based on the goal of \"preventing escape\". Purpose is equivalent to the AI's intrinsic drive and preference, which determines the focus of attention and resource allocation.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Decision: In the Wisdom layer, under the guidance of the established purpose, the perceptual information is inferentially evaluated, and specific action decisions are made. Continuing with the above example, the Wisdom layer will evaluate various data of offender A to determine whether he is attempting to commit misdeeds, and if so, decide to raise the alarm and advise the nearest police officer to approach and observe. If you are unsure, you may first strengthen covert surveillance of A. Decision-making is the concretization of Purpose, which maps out a course of action to achieve the goal.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Action: The system transforms decisions into actual output behaviors to exert influence on the environment. This includes sending reminder notifications to users, invoking linkage devices (e.g., broadcasting alarms, automatically locking doors), and other practical actions. The action is equivalent to AI acting on the environment through an actuator, which is mainly information output for human execution in prison scenarios, but can also include direct control of some devices under the conditions of the Internet of Things.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Feedback: After the action is executed, the system obtains information again through environmental changes or user feedback, evaluates the effect of the action, and updates its own status. This forms a closed loop: for example, after the alarm is issued, the police officer takes measures to stabilize the emotion of offender A, and the system senses that the conflict has subsided, so it records the incident and the results of the disposal in the knowledge base; If the analysis later reveals that the alarm is actually a false positive, the Purpose layer and the Wisdom layer will adjust the model parameters to reduce the false positive rate under similar conditions in the future. This feedback mechanism gives AI the ability to self-learn and self-correct, which is equivalent to a process of \"self-reflection\" in artificial consciousness. In particular, we introduce the \"dual circulation\" structure proposed by Professor Yucong Duan to increase the metacognitive cycle outside the basic cognitive loop. The metacognitive cycle enables the system to \"observe its own thinking\" like a human, monitor and evaluate its own decision-making, and adjust cognitive process parameters (such as reminder thresholds and model weights) when necessary to achieve self-monitoring and regulation. This ensures the stability of the long-term operation of the system, prevents decision-making from getting out of control due to environmental changes or model deviations, and gives the system a preliminary \"self-awareness\" prototype.</strong></p>\n<p>Through the multi-layer semantic network of the DIKWP model and the closed-loop mechanism of artificial consciousness, the AI part of the system will have a processing chain and adaptive ability similar to human cognition: it can not only digest complex information in layers, but also have internal purpose-driven and self-correction functions. This provides a theoretical basis for building a safe, reliable, and intelligent management system in a highly complex prison environment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-2-Overall-system-architecture\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-2-Overall-system-architecture\" title=\"4.2 Overall system architecture\"></a><strong>4.2 Overall system architecture</strong></h2><p>Based on the above theories, the overall architecture of the Wisdom Prison Intelligent Management System is designed, as described below. The system as a whole can be divided into three parts: perception acquisition layer, cognitive decision-making layer and interactive execution layer, and each part is composed of several modules, which are integrated through standard interfaces to form a unified intelligent management platform.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Perception collection layer (data acquisition and pre-processing):</strong> responsible for the collection, transmission and preliminary processing of various data in the prison, which is equivalent to the \"sensory organ\" and \"neural network\" of the system. These include:</p>\n<p>Ø <em>Environmental perception subsystem</em>: IoT sensors and intelligent monitoring equipment deployed throughout the prison, such as high-definition video cameras, infrared night vision cameras, microphones, access control sensors, positioning tags, vital signs monitoring bracelets, etc. This subsystem collects dynamic information in areas such as prisons and activity venues 24 hours a day, and uploads the data through a secure network.</p>\n<p>Ø <em>Business data integration subsystem</em>: Integrate the existing prison business information system data, including basic criminal files (crimes, sentences, criminal backgrounds, etc.), prison management systems (such as prisoner transfers, reward and punishment records), psychological correction systems (psychological assessment results, consultation records), and police duty logs. This structured data is periodically synchronized to the intelligent management system through interfaces to provide background information support for AI analysis.</p>\n<p>Ø <em>Data preprocessing module</em>: filter and convert the perceived raw data to make it suitable for subsequent analysis. On the one hand, multimedia data such as video frames and audio clips are compressed, object detection and other preprocessing (such as identifying the location coordinates of people and objects, and extracting sound features); On the other hand, multi-source data is aligned by time label and stored in a time series database or message queue. The pre-processing module ensures that the upper-layer AI obtains high-quality, standardized data streams, improving analysis efficiency and accuracy.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Cognitive decision-making layer (DIKWP intelligent core):</strong> This is the brain of the system, which adopts the DIKWP mesh model architecture, including five layers of semantic processing units of data, information, knowledge, Wisdom and Purpose, and several AI algorithm models to realize intelligent analysis and decision-making of the prison situation. The internal modules of the cognitive decision-making layer interact with each other through the semantic bus to share the extracted semantic information and context, so as to form an organically linked agent</p>\n<p>Ø <em>Data layer module</em>: connect to the perception layer and accept the preprocessed data stream. The module continuously listens to various sensor data, and packages and submits data fragments to the information layer for processing when there are trigger conditions. For example, when a vigorous movement or fighting posture is detected in the surveillance video screen, the relevant video frame data is intercepted; Collect physiological data such as heart rate per minute at regular intervals; When a new violation record is entered in the duty log, the text is immediately transmitted. The Data Layer module manages both the data cache and the histogram database, which is used to store short-term snapshots of raw data so that the information layer can request contextual data for further analysis when needed (e.g., video backtracking for a certain time period).</p>\n<p>Ø <em>Information layer module</em>: pattern recognition and event extraction for input from the data layer. A variety of AI algorithm models are applied here:</p>\n<p>ü <strong>Computer vision analysis</strong>: use the image data in the video stream to detect and identify human behaviors and events. For example, the action recognition model is used to identify actions such as fighting, falling, and self-harm; Face recognition confirms the identity and location of the person; Object detection, locating offending items (e.g., knives appearing), etc.</p>\n<p>ü <strong>Speech and text processing</strong>: NLP/speech recognition of voice and text collected within the monitoring range. For example, analyze the content or tone of conversation/shouting in the prison cell, and identify abusive quarrels and abnormal shouting; Textual sentiment analysis is carried out on the content of criminals' letters and telegrams to extract the emotional tendencies and potential purposes in them.</p>\n<p>ü <strong>Behavior pattern analysis</strong>: Based on the data of wearable devices and positioning systems, analyze the behavior trajectory and physiological indicators of criminals. For example, abnormal daily activity paths (walking around in the middle of the night) and sudden increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Anomaly detection models combined with machine learning identify behaviors that deviate from normal patterns.</p>\n<p>ü <strong>Event generation</strong>: The information layer converts the above analysis results into structured events and information output. For example, an event object is generated: \"Offender A and offender B had a physical altercation in the playground for 10 seconds\"; or status information: \"Offender C's heart rate reached the warning value three times in 5 minutes, accompanied by emotional shouting\". Each message has elements such as time, place, and whom. These events/information are published to the semantic bus for processing by the knowledge layer subscription.</p>\n<p>l <em>Knowledge layer module</em>: responsible for knowledge fusion and scenario modeling. It takes a structured stream of events from the information layer and fuses historical data and background knowledge to form a global semantic understanding of the current situation. Implementation mechanisms include:</p>\n<p>ü <strong>Knowledge graph construction</strong>: A prison semantic knowledge graph covering people, things, time, places and things is established within the system. The nodes include criminals, police officers, places, items, event types, etc., and the edges represent relationships (such as \"participated in a certain event\", \"belongs to a certain group\", \"recent psychological state\" is... ）。 When the information layer extracts a new event, the knowledge layer updates the graph, for example, adding a \"brawl incident-time\" record to the offender A node, and connecting A with a \"conflict\" relationship edge with the object B. For example, if A and B both belong to the same gang and have multiple conflicts, it may imply gang infighting or management loopholes, which need to be paid attention to by senior management.</p>\n<p>ü <strong>Situational semantic understanding</strong>: the knowledge layer gives meaning to events in combination with the context of the environment. For example, determine what scene a brawl was in (canteen?). Factory floor? ), is it related to a special day (close to a holiday?). Just finished meeting with the family? ）。 These situational factors are helpful for the subsequent fine judgment of the Wisdom layer. The knowledge layer also calculates some key indicators, such as each criminal's \"risk score\", \"psychological stability index\", etc., which are automatically updated based on the attributes in the knowledge graph and the frequency of recent events.</p>\n<p>ü <strong>Rules and reasoning</strong>: Built-in expert rule base and logical reasoning machine to perform deductive reasoning on the knowledge graph. The rule base is abstracted from prison management experience and policies and regulations, such as: \"If the offender is depressed for three consecutive days and refuses to let the offender out, it is judged that there is a depression warning\"; \"A criminal who has frequent contact with other gang members and has secret conversations is suspected of planning violations.\" When the knowledge layer detects the trigger condition of the rule, it generates the corresponding inference conclusion information and pushes it to the Wisdom layer (for example, \"Inference conclusion: Offender X may be planning a group event\").</p>\n<p>ü <strong>Two-way feedback</strong>: The knowledge layer not only accepts the input of the information layer from the bottom up, but also accepts the adjustment instructions from the Wisdom layer and the Purpose layer from the top down. For example, the Wisdom layer may find that the evaluation of certain events is biased, and will require the knowledge layer to readjust the weight of certain knowledge (such as increasing the risk weight of the offender node for recent serious disciplinary violations). This feedback allows knowledge representations to be dynamically updated to more accurately reflect reality.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Wisdom</strong> <em>Layer Module</em>: The Wisdom Layer is the decision-making and prediction center, which synthesizes the extensive semantic information of the knowledge layer and uses advanced AI models and optimization algorithms to make judgment decisions</p>\n<p>ü <strong>Security risk assessment model</strong>: One of the core functions of the Wisdom layer is risk assessment. The system rates each offender's current and future danger based on the state provided by the knowledge layer. The model integrates a variety of algorithms: first, the statistical learning model, a classification/regression model trained based on historical accident data, is input as a vector of offender attributes and recent behavior features, and outputs the probability of violations or violent incidents in a short period of time; The second is the knowledge reasoning model, which integrates the regular reasoning conclusions with the results of the statistical model to form a more explanatory risk judgment. For example, the model might output \"Offender A violence risk score = 85/100, high, reason: recent conflict with others + emotional instability after family changes\". Based on this, the Wisdom layer decides whether an alert is required.</p>\n<p>ü <strong>Psychological state analysis model</strong>: corresponding to the need for correction reminders, the Wisdom layer contains a mental health assessment algorithm. It combines the data of psychological assessment scales, the results of sentiment analysis of the text of counseling conversations, and the indicators of daily behavior, and uses the method of combining expert system and machine learning to evaluate the psychological state of criminals. For example, rating depression and suicidal tendencies, and rating motivation for reform. When a person's psychological risk exceeds the threshold, the Wisdom layer will prepare a corresponding reminder message to the psychological treatment staff, including a description of the problem and a suggested plan (for example, \"Offender B has a high risk of depression recently, it is recommended to arrange an in-depth psychological counseling\").</p>\n<p>ü <strong>Multi-dimensional Purpose Understanding</strong>: The Wisdom layer also pays attention to the purpose judgment of the offender himself, especially for safety-related behaviors. With the help of the semantic graph and NLP analysis provided by the knowledge layer, the system tries to infer the purpose behind certain behaviors. For example, by analyzing the keywords and emotional polarity of the criminal's conversation, it is judged that his current purpose is to seek help, provoke confrontation, or escape reform. This kind of content <strong>purpose analysis uses natural language processing techniques to extract sentiment and</strong> purpose propensity, which then affects the urgency of the reminder. It is worth noting that in order to protect privacy, the system does not involve specific conversation details when extracting the Purpose tendency, and only focuses on the semantics and the overall tendency of emotions. This guarantees that the privacy of the prison's internal communications is respected to a certain extent, and that alarms are only triggered when a clear danger is detected.</p>\n<p>ü <strong>Comprehensive decision-making and resource optimization</strong>: Finally, the Wisdom layer comprehensively considers the results of security risks, psychological states, Purpose judgments, etc., and makes decisions and plans according to the overall goals of the system. Objective constraints provided by the Purpose layer, such as the principle of \"safety above all else\" and the principle of \"renovation must take into account humane care\", are introduced as the overall optimization direction of decision-making. The Wisdom layer implements a multi-objective decision optimization: on the premise of ensuring that the safety purpose is not violated, the interference with the normal order is minimized, and the transformation effect is taken into account. For example, if a convict is at medium risk but is participating in important rehabilitation activities, the system may choose to give a soft reminder (such as recommending enhanced observation in secret) instead of immediate mandatory quarantine, so as to balance the contradiction between safety and rehabilitation. This reflects the human-friendly and purpose-oriented nature of AI decision-making.</p>\n<p>ü <strong>Interpretation and credibility assessment</strong>:D The added advantage of the IKWP model is that every decision has a trace, and the Wisdom layer generates an interpretable report for the important decision, indicating what key data, knowledge, and rules are cited for the decision. At the same time, the system evaluates the credibility of its own decision-making (for example, the credibility index is given based on model confidence and data completeness), and provides it to human decision-makers for reference. This design increases the transparency and credibility of AI-assisted decision-making.</p>\n<p>● <strong>Purpose</strong> <em>layer module</em>: The purpose layer is the global control unit, which runs through and supervises the entire cognitive process. Its key features include:</p>\n<p>ü <strong>Objective management</strong>: store and maintain the core objectives and policy parameters of the system. For example, \"ensuring prison safety\" and \"promoting the rehabilitation of criminals\" are refined into several quantifiable objective functions or KPI indicators for the Wisdom layer to refer to when making decisions. Define the priority strategy for risk alerts and psychological alerts (security alerts are never missed, psychological alerts can be as accurate as possible but can be delayed, etc.).</p>\n<p>ü <strong>Behavioral constraints</strong>: Monitor the decision-making of the Wisdom layer, and constrain or correct behaviors that may violate the overall purpose. For example, if AI decision-making tends to trigger alarms frequently for absolute security, resulting in a strain on management resources and even affecting the transformation atmosphere, the Purpose layer will slow down the frequency of reminders by adjusting thresholds and other methods to maintain a balance between system operation and management goals. Conversely, if the system is found to have underreported or underestimated a certain type of risk (deviating from the \"security first\" goal), the Purpose layer will increase the weight of that type of event, forcing the Wisdom layer to be more sensitive to similar situations.</p>\n<p>ü <strong>Metacognitive self-regulation</strong>: The Purpose layer realizes the metacognitive cycle, that is, the system examines and regulates its own cognition and behavior. It aggregates feedback (such as which alerts turned out to be false positives/false negatives), evaluates the deviation of the current decision-making model from the goal, and adjusts internal model parameters, knowledge weights, and even information collection strategies. This self-regulation ensures continuous improvement in system performance and goal alignment, evolving to a higher level of intelligence.</p>\n<p>ü <strong>Policy interface</strong>: Provide manual intervention interface, allowing system administrators to configure or fine-tune system policies at the Purpose layer. For example, during temporary major events, adjust the weight of security purpose to the highest (strengthen all security warnings); Or manually set the \"Focus on\" tag for a specific offender, and the Purpose layer will apply stricter standards and push special alerts to such objects. This design combines automation and manual control to ensure that the system is flexible and controllable.</p>\n<p>l <strong>Interactive execution layer (user interface and execution unit):</strong> responsible for transforming the output of the cognitive decision-making layer into actual actions for people or devices, and receiving feedback and instructions from users. It is the window through which the system interacts with the outside world, including:</p>\n<p>ü <em>Intelligent reminder interface</em>: an interactive interface provided to prison police and psychological correction cadres, which is used to receive system reminders, view analysis details and give feedback. The interface can be in the form of multi-terminal adaptation: in the prison command center, a large-screen monitoring interface is set up to display the whole prison risk situation map and high-risk personnel ranking in real time; For the front-line police on duty, provide mobile terminal APP or wearable devices (smart watches, etc.) to receive vibration/pop-up reminders to quickly understand the police situation at the scene; For psychological counselors, there is a special workbench interface to display the list of key focus objects and psychological dynamic curves. The alert interface focuses on information visualization and ease of use: colors and icons are used to identify the risk level, and click on the alert to view the analysis basis and recommended actions of AI, so that users can efficiently obtain key information.</p>\n<p>ü <em>Alarm and linkage system</em>: For serious emergencies (such as brawls, large-scale riot attempts, etc.), the system can directly trigger the linkage of physical alarm devices. For example, a siren is sounded, a warning light is lit, or a command is broadcast through an intercom system. These interconnected device interfaces are integrated with traditional prison alarm systems to ensure automatic and rapid response when AI detects a major danger. In addition, it connects to the interface of prison access control, lighting and other IoT devices, and performs predefined security actions under specific circumstances (such as automatically locking access control in specific areas, turning on emergency lighting, etc.), so as to gain disposal time for the police. Of course, these actions are controlled by Purpose-layer policies to avoid false triggers (e.g., automatic door locking only when the highest alarm level is reached).</p>\n<p>ü <em>User feedback and control</em>: The interaction layer receives user input at the same time, such as the feedback of the police on the processing results of each reminder (false positive/true, measures taken, etc.), and the psychological counselor fills in the intervention record. These feedbacks are transmitted back to the knowledge base of the cognitive decision-making layer through the interface, enriching the data learned by the subsequent model. In addition, the system provides a management console for administrators to configure system parameters (implemented through the Purpose layer interface, such as adjusting the sensitivity of reminders), audit logs, and model update management. Through the two-way interaction between humans and systems, a closed-loop management model of \"human-machine collaboration\" is formed: AI provides decision-making suggestions, humans implement and supervise, and human feedback feeds AI improvement.</p>\n<p>To sum up, all levels of the system architecture are closely coordinated: the perception layer provides all-round data senses, the cognitive layer uses the DIKWP model as the core for intelligent analysis and decision-making, and the interactive execution layer transforms intelligence into action and absorbs feedback. The whole architecture not only has a clear division of labor, but also realizes information sharing and decision-making closed-loop through a network feedback mechanism, reflecting the adaptive and autonomous collaboration capabilities of artificial consciousness, which is very suitable for the complex and dynamic application scenarios of Wisdom Prison.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-3-Workflows-and-Data-Flows\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-3-Workflows-and-Data-Flows\" title=\"4.3 Workflows and Data Flows\"></a><strong>4.3 Workflows and Data Flows</strong></h2><p>In order to illustrate the operation mechanism of the system, the following is a typical real-time risk reminder process as an example to describe the whole process of data flow of the system from data perception to reminder feedback:</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Multi-source data perception</strong> – Late one night, the sensor and system database in the prison area generated the following data: surveillance cameras captured two convicts in the corridor of the prison hall unusually approaching, and their limbs and behaviors were tense; At the same time, a wristband worn by a convict showed a sudden increase in his heart rate; In the prison information system, the convict had just received a letter from his wife filing for divorce during the day. All of this abnormal data is preprocessed and fed into the data layer of the AI system in real time.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Event and Information Extraction</strong> – The visual analysis model at the information layer identifies that two people in the corridor appear to be arguing violently (judged to be a \"conflict\" incident), and the speech analysis captures the abusive words mixed in it; Analysis of physiological data pointed out that the heart rate of offender X had reached 120 beats per minute, which was significantly higher than the benchmark and was in a state of \"emotional agitation\". The business data interface indicates that criminal X experienced a family change on the same day (divorce letter record). The information layer distills these points into structured information: <em>Event 1</em>: \"Offender X and Offender Y had an argument at 22:30 in the corridor of Cell 2\"; <em>State 1</em>: \"Offender X has abnormal physiological indicators and is suspected of being emotionally out of control\"; <em>Message 1</em>: \"Offender X receives a divorce letter during the day\". This information is published to the knowledge layer with metadata such as time, place, and people involved.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Contextual Knowledge Fusion</strong> – After receiving the above information, the knowledge layer first locates the relevant nodes in the prison knowledge graph: find the offender X and Y nodes, associate event 1 with the two and mark the location = corridor; Update the \"Family Situation\" attribute of the offender's X node to \"marriage breakdown (day)\", and record the minor incident that he has had two disputes with others on that day; According to the rule base, a relevant rule was matched: \"If a prisoner is exposed to a major negative event in a short period of time and has abnormal physiological/behavioral abnormalities, he is at risk of aggressive behavior\". The knowledge layer enforces the rule and generates an inference conclusion: \"Offender X may be currently violent\". In addition, the knowledge layer calculates the \"risk scenario\" parameter: because the time is late at night (the force on duty is weak) and the location is in the core area of the prison, once the brawl may affect many people around, the scenario risk factor is taken as a high value.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Risk Wisdom Assessment</strong> – The Wisdom layer summarizes all the current information of criminal X from the knowledge layer: his personal attributes (member of the underworld gang, less than 15 years in prison, recent emotional instability), event 1, reasoning conclusion (suspected violent tendencies), scenario risk factor (high), etc. The security risk assessment model calculates this and comprehensively scores it with reference to the machine learning prediction model and knowledge rules. At this time**, under the guidance of the Purpose layer, the system takes \"absolute prevention of major security incidents\" as the priority** Purpose, so the Wisdom layer improves the sensitivity to conflict events, and the weighted scenarios and Purpose factors affect - the formula is equivalent to increasing the correlation values in the m, n, and k coefficients, so that the reminder significance Sig reaches above the warning line. Eventually, the Wisdom layer concluded that Offender X has a risk factor of = 92 (extremely high), which can lead to a brawl or violent behavior, requiring <strong>immediate intervention</strong>. At the same time, the risk of offender Y was also assessed (due to the possibility of being assaulted due to the involvement in the dispute), a medium risk value was given, and isolation was recommended.</p>\n<p>In terms of psychology, the psychological model of the Wisdom layer noticed that offender X experienced divorce during the day, which was a major stress event according to the psychological assessment rules, and X had a tendency to have an impulsive personality on weekdays, so the model judged that he had the psychological risk of self-abandonment and aggression against others. The Mental State Index rated X as \"extremely unstable\".</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: Decision and Purpose Verification</strong> – Based on the above analysis, the Wisdom layer forms a specific disposition decision: a red alert is issued to the officer on duty with the content \"<strong>Offender X is suspected of being emotionally out of control and may commit murder</strong>.\" It is recommended that police forces be dispatched to the scene immediately to control the situation; At the same time, a command was sent to the remote loudspeaker system in the prison area, warning X and Y to stop the conflict in deterrent language; Offender X is also placed on a \"high-risk list\" for subsequent focused monitoring. This decision is submitted to the Purpose layer for review, and the Purpose layer approves execution as it is fully compliant with the highest Purpose of putting security first. In addition, the Purpose layer has updated the system's short-term management strategy for X: the monitoring sensitivity of X in the coming week has been increased, such as early warning whenever X is close to others or mood swings to prevent retaliation/self-harm. The Purpose layer also notes the case at the same time, which is used to train the system to be more sensitive to the pattern of \"risk induced by major life changes\".</p>\n<p><strong>Step 6: Alarm execution and linkage</strong> – The interactive execution layer receives the decision of the Wisdom layer and takes immediate action: the mobile app of the police on duty pops up an emergency alarm, vibrates and highlights the head picture of the offender X, the prison where he is located and the description of the police situation, accompanied by a piercing prompt sound; The X icon on the large screen of the command center flashes red, marking \"high risk\"; Sirens sounded in the prison area to deter and warn all inmates. Almost at the same time, a pre-recorded dignified password from the police on duty was transmitted over the radio: \"Warning! All personnel are not to fight, and they are to go to bed immediately...\". After receiving the App's instructions, the two nearby police officers rushed to Prison No. 2, controlled criminals X and Y within tens of seconds, and separated the two from each other. The whole set of linkage mechanisms quickly contained the possibility of greater violence.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 7: Result feedback and learning</strong> – After the situation subsided, the police on duty recorded the incident in the system (X beat Y because of family changes, but fortunately stopped it in time and did not cause serious injuries). The system senses that the conflict has stopped, the scene is quiet, and continues to monitor through microphones and cameras to confirm that there is no spread, and then marks the alarm status as \"dismissed\". Subsequently, the knowledge layer updated the map: criminal X added a new record of \"attempted brawl\"; Added a \"Attacked\" record. According to the statistics of the Wisdom layer, the alarm accurately prevented a violent accident, and confirmed that the AI judgment was basically correct according to the feedback from the police. The Purpose layer thus reinforces the confidence in the rules of a similar pattern (\"major negative events + night conflicts\"). At the same time, the system learning module incorporates the data of this case into the training set to improve the parameters of the risk model.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that if the feedback indicates that the judgment is wrong (for example, the police report that X has no attack attempt, this time it is a false alarm), the Purpose layer will intervene to adjust: reduce the weight of relevant pattern features to avoid repeated false positives in the future; At the same time, the case is used to train to improve the accuracy of the model. Through continuous feedback learning, the system gradually optimizes the accuracy and adaptability of reminders.</p>\n<p>The above process demonstrates a complete closed loop of security risk alerts. In the same way, in terms of psychological correction reminders, the system process is similar: the perception layer collects data such as psychological tests and conversation texts, the information layer extracts psychological abnormal signals (such as the increase of negative words in the text), the knowledge layer combines the background of the offender (such as first-time offenders/recidivists, personality traits), the Wisdom layer evaluates the level of psychological crisis and gives intervention decisions (such as suggesting increasing the frequency of psychological counseling or referring to professional treatment), notifies the psychologist through the interactive layer, and feeds back the correction effect in the follow-up. Regardless of security or psychological scenarios, <strong>DIKWP's hierarchical processing and closed-loop adjustment mechanism ensure that the system can operate autonomously in a complex and changeable prison environment, and continue to evolve and improve performance.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"4-4-Model-and-algorithm-design\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-4-Model-and-algorithm-design\" title=\"4.4 Model and algorithm design\"></a><strong>4.4 Model and algorithm design</strong></h2><p>In the core of system intelligence, we comprehensively use AI technologies such as knowledge graph, rule reasoning, and machine learning to achieve a high-accuracy reminder function. The following describes the key models and algorithms:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Multi-factor intelligent reminder model: For the decision-making of risk reminders, we introduce the \"intelligent reminder mechanism of scene-event-person-purpose matching\" proposed by patent CN110969420A, which takes the five dimensions of time, space, event, person, and purpose</strong> as important factors affecting the triggering of reminders. In this plan, these dimensions are customized based on the characteristics of prison business:</p>\n<p>l <strong>Time dimension: distinguish between daytime and nighttime, weekdays and holidays, and special sensitive periods (such as the eve of major events). The security risks are different at different times, and the reminder mechanism will automatically increase the sensitivity of the reminder during the period when the police force on duty is relatively weak (such as late at night).</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Spatial dimension: pay attention to the security level of the offender's location. Using the location parameters such as prison cells, labor workshops, and forbidden areas, the model determines whether the convict enters a special area (such as near the prison wall and cordon). If suspicious behavior occurs in high-risk areas, the alert priority is escalated.</strong></p>\n<p>● <strong>Event dimension: Analyze the types and characteristics of current events. For example, incidents such as brawls, self-harm, and illegal assemblies vary in severity; Critical events (e.g., planning signs) are not yet illegal, but they need to be vigilant. The model calculates the event parameter PT_E by comparing the event feature quantity with the preset mode. Serious events directly trigger high-level alarms, while general events need to be judged by superimposing other factors.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Character dimension: Consider the identity category and danger level of the person involved. For example, the principal offenders and habitual offenders of underworld forces are high-risk persons (PT_R high); Low risk (PT_R low) for first-time offenders or rehabilitated activists. In addition, if the identity of the people involved in the incident is special (e.g., contact with people related to the case, meeting with gang enemies), the weight of reminders will also be increased.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Purpose dimension: Infer the potential purpose tendency of offenders through NLP and behavior analysis. For example, the speech shows provocative aggression, negative misanthropy, etc. Only tendencies are judged and no specific privacy content is involved. Once a dangerous purpose is perceived (e.g., flight tendencies, suicidal thoughts), the alert mechanism greatly increases the risk score PT_I the person, even if there is no obvious behavior yet.</strong></p>\n<p>The model takes these five-dimensional parameters as input and uses a linear-weighted or machine learning model to calculate the Alert Significance <strong>SIG</strong>. The available formula for simplified representation is as follows: Sig = m*PT_E*Sig_SC + n*PT_R*Sig_SC + k*PT_I*Sig_SC (Sig_SC represents the scene factor, m, n, and k are the adjustment coefficients), which means that participating factors such as events, people, and purpose jointly affect the reminder intensity in a specific scenario. The adjustment coefficient is initially obtained by big data training, and then continuously corrected and optimized according to user feedback in actual use. Through this multi-factor model, the system can realize situational adaptive intelligent reminder adjustment: it will not hesitate to give strong alarms when it is really needed, and automatically reduce the sensitivity when there is a lot of interference information, so as to achieve both timely and personalized.</p>\n<p>2. Machine learning and deep learning applications: In order to enhance the system's ability to recognize complex patterns, we have introduced machine learning models in several aspects:</p>\n<p>l <strong>Risk prediction model: Supervised learning is used to train based on historical prison event data. For example, using conflicts, suicides and other events that occurred in the past few years, extracting a series of characteristics (human characteristics, event precursors, psychometric values, etc.) as training samples, and establishing classification models (such as random forests and XGBoost) to predict the probability of someone having an accident in the future. The model is trained and deployed in the Wisdom layer, where a daily rolling risk score is calculated for each offender. This data-driven model captures implicit associations and improves prediction accuracy compared to fixed rules. However, the model results are combined with knowledge rules to avoid over-reliance on statistical escape interpretiveness.</strong></p>\n<p>● <strong>Anomaly detection model: For new risks that lack labeled data, we use unsupervised/semi-supervised learning algorithms for anomaly pattern recognition. For example, the clustering algorithm learns the normal behavior pattern of criminals, and once someone's behavior deviates too much from the group mean, it is recorded as an anomaly; Alternatively, autoencoder neural networks can be used to screen for anomalies in high-dimensional sensing data (e.g., abnormal fluctuations in physiological signals). These algorithms provide exploratory clues to unknown risks, prompting human experts to pay attention and flag new rules.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Deep learning perception model: In the information layer, especially in computer vision and speech recognition, we use deep neural network models such as CNN and RNN to improve perception accuracy. For example, face recognition uses deep CNN to improve the recognition rate, action recognition uses 3D convolutional neural network to capture complex body movements, and speech recognition uses Transformer structure to recognize keywords in monitored audio. These models are pre-trained on public datasets and synthetic simulation data, and fine-tuned with a portion of actual prison scenario data to ensure their effectiveness in this scenario.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Sentiment Analysis and Purpose Recognition: Sentiment Purpose Analysis of Text and Speech Content uses NLP deep models, such as pre-trained language models such as BERT, to do transfer learning on prison conversation records to adapt to domain language (e.g., including foul language). The model outputs speaker sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) and potential purpose tags (help, threat, self-harm, etc.), and whenever there is a Purpose label with a high degree of risk correlation, the system will mark the increased PT_I and participate in the decision as an important factor. The whole NLP process also follows the privacy protection design: the model can run in a local closed environment, does not upload the call content to the cloud, and only feeds back the classification tag of the result, and does not save the complete dialogue text to prevent the leakage of sensitive information.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3. Knowledge Reasoning and Rules Engine: Despite the predictive power brought by machine learning, we still need to be rule-driven to ensure reliability and policy compliance in a highly security-sensitive environment such as</strong> prisons. The system has a built-in efficient rules engine:</p>\n<p>l <strong>Rules in the form of rules: Rules are written in the form of IFTTT or first-order logic, and the prison management regulations and expert experience are solidified. For example: \"IF a criminal contacts the forbidden area and THEN calls the police at night\"; Another example: \"IF low mental health score AND three consecutive refusals of counseling THEN psychological crisis reminder\". The rule base is constantly expanding, including safety rules, psychological rules, and compliance rules (e.g., AI must not discriminately increase the risk level due to a certain factor, etc.).</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Inference execution: The knowledge layer continuously monitors the knowledge graph, and immediately deduces the conclusion when the trigger conditions are met, so as to speed up the response. This is especially critical in emergency events: for example, when an overt violation such as \"someone climbing a fence\" is directly detected, an alert can be triggered in seconds via the rules engine without having to wait for complex model calculations.</strong></p>\n<p>● <strong>Conflict resolution: When the rule inference is inconsistent with the machine learning conclusion, the system follows the \"security first\" principle to take the maximum value, and the Purpose layer records this conflict for subsequent adjustment of the model. For example, if the rule judges high risk but the model score is low, the model should be temporarily treated as high risk and labeled with data for the model to learn, and the model should be improved to the corresponding score next time.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Knowledge learning: For new situations that are not covered, the rules are gradually supplemented through manual feedback. The system interface provides experts to enter the rules function, and after the occurrence of important accidents, the cause can be analyzed and the preventive measures can be transformed into new rules and injected into the system, so that it can draw inferences from one another. This ensures that the system logic is up-to-date and highly interpretable.</strong></p>\n<p>4. Online learning and adaptive adjustment: The system has the ability to continuously learn during operation:</p>\n<p>l <strong>Parameter tuning: reminds the threshold and weight of the model, which will be automatically adjusted according to the user's response behavior. If a certain type of reminder is marked as \"false alarm and ignored\" by the police many times, the system reduces the frequency and weight of such reminders; On the contrary, if some accidents actually occur that are not notified, the system will automatically tighten the threshold to increase sensitivity. This learning mechanism based on user operation ensures that the reminder mechanism gradually fits the actual management habits.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Personalized settings: The system allows administrators to make presets for special scenarios or personnel, for example, if a key criminal is set to \"first-level strict control\", it will be reported immediately no matter how subtle the behavior is; Some low-risk personnel can temporarily reduce the level of reminders so as not to interfere with the normal modification. The above configurations can be learned and incorporated by the system, \"remembering\" the manager's choice preferences, and automatically applying them in similar situations in the future, so that it can truly vary from person to person and from situation to situation.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Model updates: AI models are trained incrementally on a regular basis. For example, the newly accumulated data is added to the training set every month to retrain the risk prediction model to continuously improve its accuracy. The NLP model can also be fine-tuned with the latest consulting records to master new jargon and slang. The updated model will be deployed online after passing the test and verification, while the old model will be retained for future reference, in line with the principle of continuous evaluation and gradual progress in AI governance.</strong></p>\n<p>Through the design and integration of the above-mentioned multi-level models and algorithms, the system can work accurately, efficiently and flexibly in the complex and ever-changing prison environment. The DIKWP framework ensures that each algorithm module is coordinated and purpose-oriented, while machine learning gives it the ability to grow, and the rules ensure a safe bottom line and transparent interpretation, and the combination of the two enables an innovative AI system with \"intelligent self-knowledge\".</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-5-System-Interfaces-and-Integration\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#4-5-System-Interfaces-and-Integration\" title=\"4.5 System Interfaces and Integration\"></a><strong>4.5 System Interfaces and Integration</strong></h2><p>In order to ensure that the scheme can be implemented in practical engineering, the system pays attention to standard interfaces and compatible integration in the architecture design. Key interfaces and integration points include:</p>\n<p>l <strong>Data interface integration: The system connects with various prison information systems and equipment through standardized data interfaces. RESTful APIs, Web services, and other methods are used to obtain the required data (such as basic information of criminals and duty records) from the criminal management database and security supervision system, and provide SDKs for the surveillance video platform to push the analysis results. For hardware-aware devices (such as cameras and sensors), the IoT MQTT protocol or dedicated drivers are used to decouple message queues to achieve plug-and-play access to devices. In the interface design, the existing prison informatization specifications are fully considered to ensure seamless connection with the original system and reduce the difficulty of reform.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Module communication interface: Each module communicates through semantic bus and event-driven mechanism, adopts a unified protocol format (such as JSON message to describe events/knowledge objects), and publishes/subscribes to various topics. In this way, new modules or algorithm plug-ins can be easily accessed or replaced without affecting the whole. In particular, the interaction between the five layers of DIKWP modules is carried out through well-defined semantic objects (such as Data objects, Info events, Knowledge graph fragments, etc.) to maintain inter-layer decoupling and flexible expansion.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>User interaction interface: provide application interfaces adapted to different terminals. For example, mobile APP interfaces, web interfaces, and large-screen visualization interfaces all obtain data by calling unified back-end services to ensure a consistent experience. The front-end calls the back-end REST API through HTTPS to obtain the required reminder list, chart data, etc., which realizes the decoupling of the interface and logic, and facilitates the upgrading of front-end functions or the development of new terminal access in the future (for example, AR glasses interfaces may be added for patrol officers to view risk information in real time in the future).</strong></p>\n<p>● <strong>System management interface: In order to configure and monitor the system, this solution provides a management console, and after passing the security authentication, you can access some management APIs, including: rule base management (adding and deleting rules), model management (publishing new models, rolling back old versions), parameter settings (adjusting sensitivity and reminder methods), audit log query, etc. The console interface implements hierarchical authorization, and different levels of administrators can access different functions to protect system security.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Integration with higher-level platforms: Considering that Wisdom Prison is usually an overall project, the system also reserves interfaces to connect with higher-level supervision platforms (such as provincial/national prison management platforms). Through regular reporting of key indicators and safety status data, and acceptance of superior instructions (such as the province's unified safety warning notice), vertical integration is realized. The interface complies with relevant industry standards and the requirements of judicial departments (such as GA public security industry standards) to ensure the standardization and scalability of the solution.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Cross-system collaboration: Within the prison, the intelligent management system can also be coordinated with other subsystems, such as integrating with the prison emergency command system, and automatically generating a plan process in the command system when AI judges that the risk reaches a certain level; Linked with the broadcast intercom system to achieve AI audio warning; Integrate with access control to realize the dynamic control of people-to-&gt; lock doors; In the future, it can also be combined with the interface of the robot patrol system, and the AI will command the security robot to go to the scene to provide support. All of this collaboration is achieved via standard interface calls or message event-driven, with a high degree of flexibility.</strong></p>\n<p>The interface design highlights the \"open and closed principle\": it is open and compatible with the existing system (it does not replace the original functions but provides a value-added intelligence layer), and it is closed and stable for future expansion (the core interface remains unchanged, and the new functions are extended through the existing interface). This ensures that the solution can be quickly deployed in the existing prison environment during the implementation of the project, and is easy to maintain and upgrade, reducing the overall construction and operation and maintenance costs.</p>\n<h1 id=\"5-Design-for-Safety-Ethics-and-Compliance\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#5-Design-for-Safety-Ethics-and-Compliance\" title=\"5 Design for Safety, Ethics and Compliance\"></a><strong>5 Design for Safety, Ethics and Compliance</strong></h1><p>In a highly sensitive law enforcement environment such as prisons, the introduction of AI systems must not only focus on technical performance, but also strictly adhere to safety, ethics, and legal guidelines. The design of this solution integrates security and compliance requirements throughout, and measures are taken from data use to decision-making mechanism to ensure that the behavior of the system is controllable, credible, and legal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-1-Data-Privacy-Protection\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#5-1-Data-Privacy-Protection\" title=\"5.1 Data Privacy Protection\"></a><strong>5.1 Data Privacy Protection</strong></h2><p>Prison management involves a large amount of personal information and sensitive data (bioindicators, psychological counseling records, etc.) of prisoners, and we attach great importance to data privacy protection:</p>\n<p>l <strong>Principle of minimized collection: The data collected by the system is strictly limited to what is necessary for the performance of safety and correction functions. For example, audio and video surveillance is only deployed in public and regulatory necessary areas, and the content of private meetings or communications is not monitored without judicial permission; The content of psychological counseling is only used for psychological model analysis, and the results only output the degree of risk, and the complete conversation will not be recorded to avoid excessive exposure of privacy. The use of all data fields is clearly defined for purpose, avoiding unnecessary data collection and retention.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Data storage encryption: The database that centrally stores the personal data and sensor data of criminals is protected by strong encryption algorithms, and sensitive fields (names, ID numbers, etc.) are desensitized or hashed. Highly sensitive information such as psychological assessment and counseling records are stored in isolation and are only authorized to be accessed by psychological corrections personnel. The system transmission channel fully uses SSL/TLS encryption to prevent network eavesdropping.</strong></p>\n<p>● <strong>Access control and audit: Implement strict data access classification policies, and different user roles can only obtain data related to their work. For example, ordinary police officers on duty can only see the key information of real-time police information on the terminal, and cannot browse the complete psychological file; Psychologists have access to psychological records, but do not have access to other security data. Every access and operating system is logged for easy audit trail and prevention of internal misuse. Regularly inspect data access logs by prison discipline inspection or superiors, and once illegal access to personal information is discovered, strict accountability is formed, and institutionalized supervision is formed.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Privacy-preserving computing and anonymization: In order to use data to train AI models under the premise of protecting privacy, we use privacy-preserving computing technology. For example, when it is necessary to aggregate the data of multiple criminals for modeling, the personal identification information is removed or replaced by anonymous IDs, and the sensitive attributes are added with noise or homomorphic encryption methods are used to make it difficult for the model to deduce the individual identity. The trained model only needs to input real-time metrics of the current offender when inferring without revealing historical data. Especially in the psychological text analysis part, the system only extracts the emotional tendency parameters for decision-making, and does not save the original dialogue text, so as to minimize the privacy exposure.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Comply with legal requirements: Strictly abide by the Personal Information Protection Law of the People's Republic of China, the Data Security Law and other laws and regulations to ensure that the information processing of criminals and related personnel is legal and compliant. All data will be used to demonstrate and inform before use, such as some of the analysis of the content of the offender's communication, and the rules will inform the offender that the communication will be monitored by AI security at the time of prison education, and the necessary informed consent basis will be obtained. At the same time, we regularly carry out data security impact assessments, find risks and rectify them in a timely manner, and ensure that the data processing activities of the system are always within the legal red line.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"5-2-System-Security-and-Fault-Tolerance\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#5-2-System-Security-and-Fault-Tolerance\" title=\"5.2 System Security and Fault Tolerance\"></a><strong>5.2 System Security and Fault Tolerance</strong></h2><p>As the core security system, this solution ensures system security from the physical, network and application levels:</p>\n<p>l <strong>Physical deployment security: The system server is deployed in the prison intranet computer room, which is on duty and monitored 24 hours a day, and the fireproof, moisture-proof and anti-sabotage measures are complete. Dual-channel power supply and UPS are set up at key nodes to prevent system paralysis caused by power failure. For data center rooms, access control, video surveillance and other measures are adopted, and unauthorized personnel cannot access the equipment.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Network security: The prison intranet where the system is located is physically isolated from the external Internet or strictly controlled through the network gate, and only specific data is allowed to be reported to the superior platform and desensitized to prevent external network attacks. The internal network is divided into subnets and security domains, such as camera equipment and sensors connected to the isolated network segment, the access range is restricted through firewalls, and important servers are placed in the core network domain for key protection. The intrusion detection system is enabled to monitor abnormal traffic in real time, and firewall policies are deployed to block unauthorized access and malicious scanning. All communication interfaces require strong identity authentication and permission verification to prevent insiders from escalating or unauthorized operations through interfaces.</strong></p>\n<p>● <strong>Application security: The code development follows the security coding specification, and the key modules go through threat modeling and penetration testing to find vulnerabilities. Verify and filter AI model inputs to defend against adversarial sample attacks (e.g., someone deliberately creates abnormal data in an attempt to deceive the system); The AI permission is strictly restricted on the output, and the AI is not allowed to directly perform dangerous actions involving personal safety, and all key actions can only take effect after human confirmation or secondary signals (for example, the AI can suggest opening the door but must be confirmed by the administrator before it can be executed). In addition, the system provides an emergency manual takeover switch: once the AI system is abnormal (frequent false alarms or abnormal decision-making), the duty officer can switch the system to manual monitoring mode with one click, suspend the AI decision-making output, and ensure that people can intervene and control the situation at any time. This design guarantees that the AI is \"forever on a chain\" and does not get out of control.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Redundancy and fault tolerance: In order to pursue high availability, redundant deployment is adopted for key components: server dual-machine hot standby, network link redundancy, and multi-point monitoring sensors cross-covering key areas to prevent single point of failure. At the software level, fault detection and automatic switchover are implemented, such as when an analysis module crashes, the backup module is automatically put on top. Regular snapshot backup of databases, remote backup of important logs, to prevent data loss. In terms of fault-tolerant design, each module has a timeout and exception handling mechanism for downstream dependencies, and once a certain link data is missing or delayed, the system will be reasonably degraded instead of stuck. For example, if a temporary camera fails, decisions are made based only on other sensing information, and maintenance is reported at the same time, so that the entire set of reminders does not fail.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"5-3-AI-Ethics-and-Policy-Compliance\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#5-3-AI-Ethics-and-Policy-Compliance\" title=\"5.3 AI Ethics and Policy Compliance\"></a><strong>5.3 AI Ethics and Policy Compliance</strong></h2><p>When introducing AI-assisted prison management, we are deeply aware of the ethical and legal challenges it may bring, so we have set up multiple safeguards at the level of system decision-making and use:</p>\n<p>l <strong>Transparent and explainable decision-making: Prison management is directly related to the freedom and safety of personnel, and AI decision-making must be open and transparent. The DIKWP structure makes every step of the system's reasoning traceable, and this solution provides managers with detailed decision-making basis reports through interfaces, recording why AI determines that someone is at high risk (what data and rules are cited). When the system recommends drastic measures, such as segregating an inmate, the set of explanatory reports can be considered by the prison board to ensure that the decision-making process is subject to human oversight and accountability. In the event of a misjudgment that causes adverse consequences, the AI logic can be traced back to the records to improve the algorithm or adjust the rules to prevent the recurrence of the same mistakes.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Avoid bias and discrimination: AI models may be biased due to unbalanced training data, and we take measures to ensure that the system output is fair and just. The model training set tries to cover different types of criminals to prevent a certain type of person from being biased to predict its high risk because of a large sample size. In addition, manual verification of ethical rules is introduced: for example, risk assessment is not affected by non-behavioral factors such as race and religion; Give the same early warning standards to the same behavior, and do not favor one over the other. If it is found that the model has a high false positive rate for a certain group, the threshold will be manually adjusted or the rule correction will be added, so as to ensure that the system does not have subjective discrimination. In terms of psychological treatment, it is also ensured that AI does not label and insult specific psychological disorders, but neutrally describes the state for professional reference.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Human-machine collaboration and manual adjudication: Emphasizing the status of AI-assisted decision-making, rather than replacing humans to make final decisions. All system alerts are recommendations in nature, and the specific disposition is still at the discretion of the civilian police or prison superintendent. This plan clearly requires that AI alerts must be confirmed by the police officer on duty, and the psychological assessment given by AI must be interviewed and verified by a psychologist. In particular, decisions involving serious consequences (such as increased punishment and compulsory treatment) can only be based on the AI report, and the final conclusion will be ruled through established legal procedures, so as to prevent the occurrence of \"AI convictions\" violations. Human beings maintain the right to know and veto AI, and AI must not interfere with human final discretion.</strong></p>\n<p>Respect <strong>for the basic rights of criminals: Although prisoners are restricted in their personal freedom, they still enjoy basic rights such as human dignity in accordance with the law. The system is designed to avoid violating these bottom lines: not using shaming language or publicly publicizing someone's psychological problems, not arbitrarily expanding surveillance into areas that are not allowed by law, and not directly punishing or discriminating against criminals based on AI assessments. When implementing psychological interventions, humanized counseling is carried out by professionals, rather than simply forcing medication based on AI conclusions. In short, technology has always served the purpose of helping criminals rehabilitate, not to become a new tool of coercive control.</strong></p>\n<p>l <strong>Policy and regulatory compliance: This plan conforms to the guiding ideology and normative requirements of the Chinese judicial administrative department for the construction of Wisdom Prison. For example, the Ministry of Justice emphasizes the principle of \"early warning and situation analysis\", and this system achieves this through AI intelligent research and judgment. At the same time, it follows the national policies on the safety, controllability and ethics of artificial intelligence, such as the \"Principles for the Governance of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence\" and the \"Measures for the Review of Science and Technology Ethics\", etc., to implement explainable, controllable, and responsible AI in prison scenarios. Before the implementation, we will organize ethical arguments and legal compliance assessments, and invite legal experts, ethics experts and regulatory representatives to review the plan to ensure that it is not contrary to law and social morality before it can be deployed. Establish a regular algorithm assessment and reporting system during the operation process, continuously report the effectiveness of the system and existing problems to the higher-level organs, accept supervision, and make timely adjustments according to policies. If necessary, you can apply for safety assessment and industry standard certification from relevant national departments to ensure that the technology and products used are within the scope of the license.</strong></p>\n<p>Combining the above measures, the system has established a solid bottom line of safety, ethics and law from both technical and management aspects. While ensuring that AI empowers prison management to improve efficiency, it also ensures that AI is controlled by laws and regulations and human values, so as to truly achieve \"technology for good, technology for the rule of law\".</p>\n<h1 id=\"6-Implementation-Prospects\"><a class=\"hidden\" href=\"#6-Implementation-Prospects\" title=\"6 Implementation Prospects\"></a><strong>6 Implementation Prospects</strong></h1><p>Based on the cutting-edge DIKWP artificial consciousness theory and rich engineering considerations, this technical solution proposes a new framework for intelligent prison management of Wisdom. In order to put the plan into practice, we finally put forward the prospect and suggestions for the implementation of the project:</p>\n<p><strong>Phased implementation route</strong>: Considering the differences in the current status of prison informatization and the complexity of AI systems, it is recommended to implement it in stages. In the first stage, pilot prisons with better conditions can be selected to deploy basic functions (such as video intelligent analysis and early warning, basic risk model) to verify the technical feasibility. In the second stage, the whole prison was expanded and the psychological correction module was launched, which was deeply integrated with the original management system. In the third stage, the algorithm will be optimized and the rule base will be improved based on the pilot experience, and gradually rolled out to more prison units. Reduce implementation risk by taking a step-by-step approach and smoothing the transition.</p>\n<p><strong>Personnel training and process optimization</strong>: The introduction of intelligent systems requires supporting personnel training. Prison police and psychological corrections personnel should be trained in the use of AI systems, so that they can master interface operations, alarm handling processes, feedback labeling methods, and so forth. At the same time, the existing workflow is optimized, AI reminders are incorporated into the duty code, alarm response SOPs are formulated, and the legal effect and disposal requirements of AI prompts are clarified to ensure smooth human-machine cooperation. For example, a daily risk briefing system is established, and reports are generated by AI for the leadership team to discuss and judge. Only when both the human and machine aspects are in place can the system be truly effective.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance and safety assessment</strong>: After implementation, the performance indicators of the system (such as effective alarm rate, accident reduction rate, improvement of correction success rate, etc.) and safety indicators (false positives and false negatives, data security incidents, etc.) should be continuously evaluated. Adjust the problems found in a timely manner, and suspend relevant functions for rectification if necessary. Pay special attention to the hidden dangers caused by algorithm bias, and establish a regular review mechanism to eliminate undesirable biases. Feedback from frontline prison staff should also be collected to assess the impact of AI on workload and psychological stress, so as to ensure that the system effectively helps police reduce the burden and increase efficiency, rather than increasing the burden.</p>\n<p><strong>Patented technology integration</strong>: The patented achievements of Professor Yucong Duan's team (such as intelligent reminder mechanism CN110969420A, etc.) have been partially referred to in the design of this scheme, and the subsequent implementation can be carried out in cooperation with relevant teams or enterprises to modularly integrate the patented technology into the system. For example, the semantic analysis engine in the patent, the Purpose recognition module, etc., are introduced to speed up the development progress and take advantage of their advancement. At the same time, pay attention to obtaining legal authorization, abide by intellectual property norms, and create an example for the combination of production, education and research.</p>\n<p><strong>Application prospects</strong>: Once the Wisdom prison management system is successfully implemented, it will significantly improve the level of prison safety management and the quality of rehabilitation, and realize the goal of \"<strong>prevention before it happens, correction and treatment in the invisible</strong>.\" \". AI real-time risk analysis can minimize the occurrence of violence, escape, suicide and other accidents in prison, and ensure the safety of people's lives and property. Intelligent psychological counseling helps offenders rebuild their personality and smoothly return to society. In addition, the concept and architecture of the system (DIKWP artificial awareness model) have a wide range of reference significance in the field of law enforcement security, and can be popularized and applied to detention centers, community corrections supervision, and other places that need comprehensive safety warning. Through continuous practice and improvement, it will also accumulate valuable experience for the application of China's sovereign artificial intelligence technology in public safety scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The Wisdom prison intelligent management solution proposed in this report integrates cutting-edge AI cognitive models with the actual needs of prison management, and strives to build a safe, efficient and people-oriented new prison management ecosystem. Through systematic architecture design and comprehensive security compliance considerations, the solution has good implementability and promotion value. We believe that under the guidance of the competent authorities and the collaboration of the industry, with the help of innovative technologies such as DIKWP artificial awareness, the blueprint of Wisdom Prison will surely move from vision to reality, and provide strong scientific and technological support for the modernization of prison governance in the new era. We will continue to refine and refine the details of the plan to ensure that this intelligent system can be implemented as soon as possible and make a positive contribution to prison security and social harmony.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"
