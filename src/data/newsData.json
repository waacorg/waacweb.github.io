The invited guests span many fields—computer science, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, philosophy, mathematics, economics, and more—including Nobel Prize laureates, Turing Award recipients, Fields Medalists, and leading figures across disciplines. These experts have outstanding achievements in their respective fields and have profound, direct or indirect influence on research in artificial intelligence and consciousness. This report systematically summarizes the invitation status of all invited international experts and scholars, introducing their backgrounds, credentials, and influence, and describing their responses and forms of participation. Overall analysis shows the conference’s exceptional level of internationalization and academic stature: more than 40 top international experts were invited, and to date most have confirmed participation or will contribute academic reports online or on site; those unable to attend have also written to express their blessings and support. The following sections present a detailed overview of the invited experts, highlight commentary, and selected excerpts of their messages.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/news/2026-01-04-wcac-preparatory-progress/2.png\" alt=\"2.png\" /></p>\n<h2>Overall Analysis of Invitations</h2>\n<p>Scope and Level of Invitations: The conference has invited internationally renowned scholars and industry leaders from more than ten countries, including laureates of the world’s top awards such as the Nobel Prize, Turing Award and other top global prizes, members of major European and American academies, and other key figures related to AI and consciousness research. The invited guests span a wide range of fields: pioneers in computer science and AI, authorities in neuroscience and cognitive science, and thinkers with profound insights at the intersection of the humanities and social sciences. Such a broad and high-profile lineup highlights the conference’s ambition and influence—grounded in frontier issues of AI and consciousness and aiming to bring together top minds worldwide.</p>\n<p>Confirmed Participation: To date, among the guests who have replied,more than half have confirmed that they will participate in different ways. Some experts will attend in person for on-site exchanges. For example, WAAC Academician and Fudan University brain-science expert Gerwin Schalk and others have accepted the invitation and plan to attend the conference in person and deliver keynote speeches. More experts will present or discuss online through formats such as pre-recorded video talks, live video-linked presentations, or written submissions. For example, Ohio State University professor and World Food Prize laureate Rattan Lal has confirmed that he will submit a keynote video; and neurologist at the University of Exeter in the UK, Adam Zeman will contribute by writing a special academic report for the discussions. The conference secretariat has provided flexible participation options tailored to different guests, ensuring they can contribute in forms that suit them. Overall statistics show that nearly 20 invited international experts have confirmed participation through talks or written reports, including several world-renowned scholars. This scale of participation not only demonstrates the appeal of the conference theme to global experts, but also reflects the efficiency and professionalism of the conference organization.</p>\n<p>Support from Invitees Unable to Attend: Some invited guests are unable to attend in person due to schedule, health, holidays, and other reasons, but almost all respondents expressed strong alignment with the conference’s vision and offered sincere blessings and support in their replies. Many world-class masters praised the importance of the conference theme and wished the event a complete success. For example, the Turing Award laureate hailed as one of the “fathers of the Internet” for co-inventing the TCP/IP protocol, Vinton G. Cerf though unable to attend because of a scheduling conflict, wrote in his reply that “it sounds like it will be a great conference” and conveyed his good wishes for a successful meeting. Another example is the 2017 Turing Award laureate and former President of Stanford University, John L. Hennessy who concluded his letter by saying: “Thank you for your invitation. I cannot attend, but I sincerely hope the conference is successful.” Another example is the contemporary philosopher of mind David J. Chalmers who, although unable to attend, wrote back: “Best wishes for the conference,” and spoke highly of the conference theme. These sincere messages fully reflect the conference’s convening power and the international academic community’s attention and support for artificial-consciousness topics. The organizing committee also plans to share these blessings and messages during the conference to showcase its international influence and ability to bring the community together.</p>\n<p>In summary, the overall results of the invitation outreach for this conference have been remarkable: broad coverage, high level, and enthusiastic responses from guests.Among the more than 40 invited experts, nearly 20 guests have confirmed attendance or agreed to provide reports, spanning multiple online and on-site formats; the remaining guests who cannot attend have also expressed support and blessings through letters. This not only demonstrates the academic appeal of the conference theme—“artificial consciousness”—but also indirectly reflects that China’s influence in initiating global dialogue in this frontier field is rising. In the following sections, we classify the invited experts by field, introduce and comment on them one by one, and quote selected key sentences from some replies for readers’ appreciation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Highlights of Invited Experts by Field</h2>\n<p>To present the roster of invited guests in a clear and organized way, the experts are grouped below into several categories by research field.

Her reply reflects the policy-research community’s emphasis on frontier topics such as artificial consciousness; her ideas will, through this interaction, provide inspiration for the conference’s societal-level discussions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Selected Excerpts of Experts’ Blessings and Messages</h2>\n<p>During the invitation process, many international masters shared sincere words in their letters; their support and expectations for the conference are deeply moving. Below are selected heartfelt lines from some replies, for readers’ appreciation:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Turing Award laureate Vinton G. Cerf wrote in his letter:“I wish I could accommodate this lovely invitation... It sounds like a great conference!”(“I really wish I could accept this wonderful invitation… it sounds like a great conference!”). In just a few words, he conveyed his blessings.</li>\n  <li>Former Stanford University president John L. Hennessy concluded his reply with:“I hope it is a successful conference.”(“I hope the conference is successful.”). Concise, yet full of expectation.</li>\n  <li>Philosopher of mind David J. Chalmers wrote sincerely:“ I wish you all the best with the event!”(“I wish the conference all the best!”). The master’s blessings leap off the page.</li>\n  <li>At the age of 93, Turing Award laureate Dana S. Scott replied in a witty tone:“Best wishes for a successful conference.”(“Sincere wishes for the conference’s complete success.”). Between the lines shines an elder’s care and support for the work of the next generation.</li>\n  <li>Renowned economist Christopher A. Pissarides candidly wrote in his reply:“I agree with you that it is a very important and topical issue. I hope you have a good conference.”(“I agree with you that it is a very important and topical issue. I hope you have a good conference.”). It is evident that the topic of artificial consciousness resonates with experts from different fields and is truly a question of our times.</li>\n  <li>In the reply from Tristan Harris’s assistant, the message reads:“Best wishes for a successful conference. Please do keep us in mind for future opportunities.”(“Best wishes for a successful conference. Please do keep us in mind for future opportunities.”). This reflects affirmation of the conference and willingness to engage in future participation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These brief words are filled with the invitees’ support and high hopes for the conference. Such blessings reflect the international academic community’s emphasis on artificial-consciousness research and show that this conference has already made waves on the global intellectual landscape. With so much sincere encouragement and expectation, the organizers and participants feel an even greater sense of mission—and an even stronger confidence.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion and Outlook</h2>\n<p>In summary, the invitation outreach for the 3rd World Conference on Artificial Consciousness has achieved fruitful results: dozens of world-class experts and scholars across disciplines were invited and responded enthusiastically. On the one hand, many international masters have confirmed they will contribute to the conference through keynote talks, special videos, written messages, and other formats, demonstrating the conference’s academic appeal and global influence; on the other hand, even guests who cannot attend for various reasons have written to express support, bringing their reflections and blessings on artificial-consciousness topics to the conference. This grand gathering of distinguished minds—young and old alike is exactly the outcome of careful preparation and the shared expectations of the international academic community.</p>\n<p>The conference’s guest lineup is exceptionally impressive and its disciplinary coverage unusually broad—rare among similar domestic academic conferences. The participation of heavyweight figures such as Nobel laureates and Turing Award winners places the conference at the very frontier of developments in the relevant research fields. It is foreseeable that during the meeting, guests from different backgrounds will generate new sparks through intellectual exchange, driving leapfrog progress in research on artificial intelligence and consciousness. From sensorimotor-loop theory to measures of machine consciousness, from neural mechanisms in the brain to reflections on technology ethics, many frontier topics will be explored and deepened at the conference.</p>\n<p>All of this signals that artificial consciousness—perhaps the ultimate frontier of human science and philosophy—is increasingly becoming a focus of global attention. By bringing together top international wisdom, this conference has built a high-level platform for dialogue. It is expected not only to generate substantial scholarly results, but also to demonstrate China’s openness to collaboration and its determination to lead exploration in this field.</p>\n<p>As the conference approaches, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to all guests who have supported and participated in the conference. As so many masters have wished, we look forward to the complete success of the 3rd World Conference on Artificial Consciousness and hope it will become an important milestone in advancing global research on artificial intelligence and consciousness. The smooth convening of the conference will also bring us new inspiration and outlook: humanity’s quest for“artificial consciousness” is long and arduous. Along this road, international cooperation and the blending of ideas will be the guiding lights that illuminate the unknown. Let us wish the conference complete success, and may the future exploration journey of artificial consciousness be starry and fruitful!</p></div>"

He also called for deeper interdisciplinary collaboration across computational science, life medicine, and other fields to inspire innovation and achieve technological breakthroughs. He expressed high expectations for the integration of artificial consciousness and proactive medicine.\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/liuzhen.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;Academician Zhen Liu, in his speech, welcomed participants from all sectors to gather and explore the profound theme of \"The Future of Artificial Consciousness.\" He noted that artificial intelligence has already transformed the way we work and that its pace of evolution has exceeded expectations. We now stand at the forefront of a new technological revolution, delving into the challenge of endowing machines with higher-level self-awareness and emotional integration—a pursuit that goes beyond technological advancement to encompass philosophical, ethical, and social dimensions. He stressed the need to reflect on the implications of artificial consciousness for human society, its differences from human self-awareness, and how to ensure its safety, ethics, and progress. He described this as a global, interdisciplinary issue with far-reaching social significance.\n                <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/chj.png\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;At the annual meeting, Academician Hengjin Cai, Vice President of the World Artificial Consciousness Association, summarized the work of the past year and outlined prospects for the future. He stated that, in terms of theoretical exploration, a consensus has been established that consciousness and intelligence share a common origin. At its core, this theory posits that consciousness stems from a form of cognitive inertia evolved by living beings to escape the constraints of physical time and space. Intelligence is defined as the ability to reconstruct causal chains, while consciousness is the experience of a non-local internal world. This framework, he emphasized, serves as a theoretical cornerstone for understanding artificial consciousness. In applied practice, proactive medicine and artificial consciousness have become deeply integrated. Digital twin technology is now being applied in health management, enabling the simulation of individual physiological, psychological, and cognitive patterns to predict disease risks and deliver personalized interventions—thus returning to a human-centered medical philosophy. Regarding preparations for the Third World Artificial Consciousness Congress, he proposed focusing on the themes of symbiosis and standardization. He advocated for a new paradigm of human-machine integration in which human values become embedded within AI itself. At the same time, he stressed that the standardization committee must develop a forward-looking and inclusive ethical framework. He concluded by underscoring that artificial consciousness is a civilizational issue and called for global collaboration to build a safe, trustworthy, and coexistent intelligent future.\n                <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/ylh.png\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;Academician Aikebai’er Yilahon, in his address, remarked that the 21st century is the era of biotechnology and electronic information technology. He noted that electronic information has now advanced to the stage of artificial consciousness (AC) development, achieving a high level in just over two decades. AC has had a significant impact on humanity, especially in its integration with biotechnology and medicine, where it plays a highly effective role.\n                <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/wdf.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;Academician Dongfang Wu, during the annual meeting, paid tribute to pioneers in the global field of artificial consciousness. As a scholar deeply engaged in distributed governance networking technologies, he pointed out that the computing power revolution is the cornerstone of artificial consciousness development. Breakthroughs in supercomputing technology are pushing the boundaries of biological intelligence, enabling a leap from content generation to the emergence of consciousness in machines. In proactive medicine, this shift supports a paradigm change toward predicting disease before it occurs. He noted that one of the current core challenges is designing scientifically measurable and verifiable metrics for consciousness. He recommended building a DIKWP standard system and emphasized the need for hardware-software collaboration in supercomputing to overcome existing bottlenecks. He expressed hopes that the third congress will promote synergy across the technology chain (integrating high-performance computing, neuroscience, etc.) and interdisciplinary innovation in real-world applications (such as health management in proactive medicine). He also called for the establishment of a cross-civilizational ethical consensus to ensure technological development aligns with human values. He concluded by stressing that researchers are not only explorers of technology but also guardians of human values, and urged for breaking down disciplinary barriers.\n                <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/lcg.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;Academician Chunguo Li, in his speech, shared that his team has long been engaged in research on information and communication engineering as well as the theories and key technologies of artificial intelligence. In recent years, they have actively explored deep interdisciplinary integration with artificial consciousness, brain-computer interfaces, and proactive medicine, achieving several phased results. He expressed his hope to strengthen communication and collaboration with peers around the world to advance academic progress in artificial consciousness and promote technologies that benefit all of humanity.\n                <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/fyh.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;Academician Yuanhui Fu, in his speech, called for integrating ecological security and bioethics into the development of artificial consciousness. He pointed out that artificial consciousness technologies are emerging alongside the Earth's ecological tipping points, facing challenges such as the ecological footprint of expanding computing power, algorithmic distortion of ecological complexity, and biodiversity risks triggered by competition over neural hardware resources. He emphasized the need to construct a symbiotic framework between artificial consciousness and the environment. Drawing on practices from relevant academies, he proposed injecting a \"life-first\" gene into the DIKWP model from a technical perspective, initiating a Global Computing Power Ecological Pact to implement quota management and resource sharing, and designating ecological red zones for consciousness technologies where high-risk applications are prohibited.\n                <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/ycp.png\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;Academician Chongpu Yao expressed his honor in being invited to the conference.

The establishment of a Proactive Medicine Special Committee and the convening of academic conferences aim to deepen understanding of proactive medicine and promote its integration with artificial intelligence and medical innovation. He suggested that the conference explore topics such as the promotion of proactive medicine concepts, AI advancements and applications in healthcare (e.g., disease prediction, health management), related ethical and legal issues and policy frameworks, integration of industry and education, talent development, incentive mechanisms, and international cooperation. He expressed hope that the conference would result in consensus and actionable plans to drive medical innovation and address global healthcare challenges.\n                <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/fy.png\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;President Yu Feng, in his address, stated that the deep integration of artificial consciousness and proactive medicine is reshaping the paradigm of modern healthcare. By combining the Traditional Chinese Medicine concept of “preventive treatment of disease” with AI’s predictive capabilities, a transformation from disease treatment to health foresight can be achieved—enhancing diagnostic efficiency and reshaping patient-centered care. He emphasized that this is not only a technological upgrade but also a breakthrough in medical thinking. At the same time, he pointed out that the field faces several challenges, including unclear ethical boundaries, incomplete international technical standards and data-sharing mechanisms, and the need to establish clinical diagnostic protocols and liability frameworks. These breakthroughs, he said, will determine the depth and breadth of AI applications in healthcare. This gathering, he noted, aims to explore the construction of ethical standards, models for international collaboration, and solutions for intelligent transformation, expressing hope for in-depth exchanges with experts to advance cross-disciplinary integration.\n                <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/AI_aj.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;Prof. Mohamad al-Ashhab, Dean of Benha Faculty of Medicine in Egypt, stated at the annual meeting that he had discussed the application of AI in medicine during the 2nd World Artificial Consciousness Congress, including its use in medical diagnosis and treatment, the entire surgical process (preoperative planning, intraoperative assistance, postoperative recovery, and intensive care), and medical education (training medical students’ skills). He emphasized that this conference holds great significance for advancing the AI era in medicine and expressed hope for joint efforts to raise awareness of AI’s role in healthcare, achieve large-scale adoption to reduce costs, and develop autonomous artificial consciousness and AI systems. He also looked forward to meeting participants in person, expressed gratitude for the support received, and wished for strengthened collaboration between Egypt, China, and other association member countries.\n                <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/gxp.png\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;Xiaoping Guo, former principal and founder of the Linfen Red Ribbon School in Shanxi, shared that he has been focusing on the application of mobile internet in healthcare since 2007. In 2010, he designed health check-up center software incorporating intelligent medical features. Since 2015, he has continued to study mobile and internet-based healthcare solutions, and in 2020 began exploring the integration of AI and medicine. He has developed systems such as an electronic health record framework and intelligent medication boxes, aiming to break the barriers of hospital medical record systems and empower both patients and the general public in managing their own health—particularly emphasizing safe medication use among the elderly.\n                <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/fjx.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;President Kaixi Fan stated that the core difference between AI and artificial consciousness (AC) lies in their functional orientation and depth of cognition—AI focuses on optimizing efficiency, while AC aims to achieve deeper levels of cognition. Their commonality lies in simulating and extending human intelligence: AI provides the foundation for AC, and AC, in turn, may further drive the evolution of AI. Both remain in the early stages of exploration and face significant technical and ethical challenges. As a design scholar, he noted that AI has evolved into a content creator, prompting reflection on whether machines can possess artistic sensibility and humanistic care. He emphasized the concept of “techno-art fusion” and its intersection with artificial consciousness, stressing the need to design observation interfaces and standards for consciousness. He also pointed out that AI and AC could provide services infused with humanistic care in fields such as proactive medicine. In conclusion, he called for enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration.\n                <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/dex.png\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;Professor Erxiang Dou, in his speech, proposed that artificial consciousness is driving a new paradigm in human civilization, which requires the construction of an appropriate foundation for economic and social governance. He introduced his theory of “Tri-Fairism” (TRIF)—an approach developed through research in digital economic finance, positioned between government and market forces, and aiming for fairness, justice, and the dual objectives of extracting wealth and generating well-being. TRIF is deeply integrated with the DIKWP cognitive model and is designed to address the core issues of releasing creativity and anchoring human welfare during the development of machine consciousness. He emphasized that during the cognitive leaps enabled by the DIKWP model, the TRIF framework should be used to tackle crises of economic fairness (such as preventing algorithmic hegemony) and challenges to consciousness sovereignty (such as constraining the capitalization of neural data). He called on the preparatory committee to promote the development of DIKWP-TRIF tools—capable of quantifying the technical, institutional, and financial attributes of related projects—and to initiate the drafting of global governance principles for the consciousness economy, including defining property rights over neural data. He concluded with well wishes for the success of the annual meeting and the upcoming Third World Artificial Consciousness Congress.\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/ybl.png\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;Dr. Yingbo Li, Secretary-General of the World Academy of Artificial Consciousness (WAAC), stated in his address that over the past year, WAAC has expanded its headquarters from the United States to France—a strategic move aimed at fostering broader international collaboration and academic integration. Seven specialized committees have already been established, and he proposed the addition of two more to address interdisciplinary challenges. He emphasized that WAAC’s core research focuses on the DIKWP model, which guides both theoretical inquiry and practical application across various interdisciplinary domains, including proactive medicine and law. He expressed gratitude to the World Artificial Consciousness Association for awarding him the DIKWP International Cooperation Award, describing it as recognition of collective efforts. He reaffirmed WAAC’s commitment to advancing global academic exchange and promoting responsible cross-cultural development in the field. Looking ahead, he stated that WAAC will continue to uphold values of openness and serve as a global platform to support the creation of a scientifically grounded and ethically regulated vision for artificial consciousness.\n                <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/whp.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;Prof. Huaping Wang expressed his agreement with the conference's theme of placing ethical reflection at the core of technological development. He emphasized that artificial consciousness is not merely an engineering problem, but one that compels humanity to rethink the meaning of consciousness, agency, and responsibility. These complex questions, he said, must be addressed through clear concepts and a normative worldview. He expressed hope that the Third World Artificial Consciousness Congress will continue to support interdisciplinary dialogue, showcasing technological progress while also delving into its underlying philosophical and ethical foundations. He stressed that standardization and governance must be based on a clear understanding of the nature of artificial consciousness in order to build systems that are not only intelligent but also justifiable.\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/wch.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;Prof. Chunhui Wang delivered a speech titled “From Large Models to World Models.” He pointed out that since the release of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, generative AI has branched into two main areas: large language models (LLMs) and world models. LLMs rely on one-dimensional representation based on text sequences, while multimodal models still suffer from issues such as \"hallucinations.\" In contrast, world models are built upon understanding the laws of the physical world, moving toward three-dimensional digital spaces. Their essence lies in predicting changes in the physical world, which is foundational for the development of embodied intelligence. He argued that achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) hinges on enabling intelligence to comprehend physical laws. AI agents must align with human values and operate within authorized boundaries. He recommended that the Artificial Consciousness Association conduct research into areas such as the neural mechanisms of consciousness, affective computing, AGI, and the integration of ethics and philosophy to ensure that AI development remains aligned with human interests.\n                <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/zx.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;Academician Xiao Zhang stated that over the past year, with the support of the Association, the committee has carried out effective work focusing on the integration of artificial consciousness with proactive medicine, medical informatization, artificial intelligence, and big data. These efforts have promoted the transformation of the proactive medicine concept from theory to application and achieved significant progress in medical informatization and intelligent diagnosis and treatment, thereby providing technological support for personalized and intelligent healthcare. As a scholar in this field, he believes that the integration of artificial consciousness with cutting-edge technologies is a key pathway for the proactive transformation of the healthcare system. Looking ahead, the committee will continue to drive technological innovation, develop intelligent diagnostic and treatment platforms, and promote international standardization. He also emphasized the importance of strengthening global interdisciplinary cooperation to address ethical governance challenges and stated that proactive medicine requires both technological support and an ethical framework aligned with human interests.\n                <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/wzd.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;Prof. Zhongdao Wu from Sun Yat-sen University’s Zhongshan School of Medicine remarked that proactive medicine, powered by AI technologies, is reshaping the paradigm of health management—shifting from disease treatment to risk prediction and from experience-based decisions to data-driven strategies. This transformation injects new momentum into the high-quality development of China’s healthcare system and provides a more precise path toward realizing the Healthy China vision. He noted that the development of medicine has entered a new phase that requires interdisciplinary integration.\n                 <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/chy.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;Dr. Haoyang Che from Zeekr stated that artificial consciousness is a cutting-edge research topic, and the DIKWP theory proposed by Academician Yuchong Duan provides an innovative framework for constructing artificial consciousness. With the widespread emergence of new computational paradigms such as liquid neural networks and spiking neural networks, along with the gradual maturity of brain-computer interface technologies, he believes the field of artificial consciousness is poised for revolutionary breakthroughs—and he eagerly anticipates what’s to come.\n                 <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/Annual_Meeting/wkg.png\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: inline-block;\"><br>\n</div>\n &emsp;&emsp;Dr. Kunguang Wu, one of the secretaries of the International Standardization Committee for AI DIKWP Evaluation, summarized the committee’s work on behalf of the team. He noted that significant progress was made in advancing the DIKWP strategy and practical framework based on artificial consciousness. One of the most notable achievements was the official release of 10 benchmark standards for evaluating artificial consciousness. These standards cover key areas such as concepts, DIKWP under semantics, mathematics, systems, assessment testing, creativity hallucination, safety, debate, art, and emotion. This milestone represents a major collaborative effort and marks a critical step in defining evaluation protocols.

In the Journal of Neuroscience (2013), they showed that the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) directly participates in the conscious perception of illusory wholes. In the Journal of Neuroscience (2018), they proposed a “general mechanism of perceptual organization,” demonstrating that posterior parietal cortex acts as a hub for scene segmentation across multiple motion cues, accompanied by decreased responses in early visual cortex—consistent with feedback modulation predicted by predictive coding. At the level of feedback and prediction, the team reported in Cerebral Cortex (2017) that predictive signals in early visual areas (V1–V3) can arise via feedback pathways from higher-level regions. At the level of representation and subjective experience, they showed in the Journal of Neuroscience (2018) that activity patterns in hV4 encode both external color and the behavioral expression of color imagery, bridging stimulus-driven and internally generated color perception.

His comprehensive review in Sleep Medicine Reviews systematically mapped the generation mechanisms and functional roles of sleep spindles, establishing a thalamo–cortical framework for understanding spindle activity. In NeuroImage (2005), he introduced the concept of an individual “fingerprint” of the sleep EEG, demonstrating stable inter-individual differences in NREM power topography and providing a reliable phenotype for longitudinal tracking of consciousness levels and cognitive traits. Through studies of K-complexes in stage-2 sleep—and subsequent work in Alzheimer’s disease cohorts—he further showed the value of K-complexes as indices of sleep stability, synchronization, and pathological change. These achievements have refined the physiological understanding of how conscious states are regulated during sleep and supplied reusable signal-based markers for clinical applications and computational modeling.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Global Collaboration and Academic Ecosystem</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Academicians of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness hail from institutions such as Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Cambridge, the University of California, the French Academy of Sciences, the University of Padua, the University of Queensland, Columbia University, and the University of Exeter.

In Perspectives on Psychological Science (2011), she proposed the Arousal-Biased Competition (ABC) theory to account for why arousal selectively enhances or suppresses perception and memory. In Neurobiology of Aging (2016), she used neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to demonstrate links between LC signal and cognitive reserve. In the Journal of Neuroscience (2018), combining fMRI, pupillometry, and LC indices, she showed that LC activity strengthens consolidation of high-priority information. Further, studies in NeuroImage (2017) and the International Journal of Psychophysiology (2023; randomized controlled trial) connected LC-MRI measures with high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) and with HRV biofeedback, respectively, illustrating the feasibility and plasticity of modulating the arousal–attention system via autonomic pathways.

In eLife (2017), he introduced a multichannel cross-frequency coupling method based on generalized eigen-decomposition (gedCFC), enabling the detection of integrative cross-frequency pathways in multichannel data. In Journal of Neuroscience Methods (2021), he further proposed gedBounds to derive individualized frequency-band boundaries in a data-driven manner.

Bentley, Honorary Professor and Teaching Fellow in the Department of Computer Science at University College London (UCL), has been elected an Academician of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness (WAAC) in recognition of his systematic contributions to bio-inspired evolutionary computation, self-organizing systems, and artificial immune computation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/media/50.png\" style=\"width:30%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;\"/></p>\n<p>Over the years, Professor Bentley has pursued a unifying theme of “evolution and self-organization,” building a chain of theoretical and engineering evidence from evolutionary design and creative evolutionary systems to artificial immune systems (AIS): in Evolutionary Design by Computers (Morgan Kaufmann, 1999), which he edited, he systematically argued for the generative power of evolutionary algorithms in engineering and product design; in Creative Evolutionary Systems (Academic Press / Morgan Kaufmann, 2002), he broadened evolutionary-generative methods to creative domains including art, music, and architecture; at GECCO (2001) and in subsequent papers (2001–2002), together with collaborators he proposed AIS for network intrusion detection, integrating negative selection, clonal selection, and gene-library evolution and developing the Dynamic Clonal Selection (DynamiCS) framework; subsequent surveys systematically reviewed immune-inspired intrusion detection, highlighting the self-organizing, distributed, and robust properties of these approaches. Taken together, these works provide testable computational models and experimental pathways for understanding “consciousness cues” in artificial systems—such as selective response, resource allocation, and global coordination—and point to practical routes toward scalable, resilient intelligent behavior.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Global Collaboration and Academic Ecosystem</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Academicians of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness hail from institutions such as Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Cambridge, the University of California, the French Academy of Sciences, the University of Padua, the University of Queensland, Columbia University, and the University of Exeter.

In Current Biology (2007), he confirmed the causal role of the parietal cortex in number processing by inducing a “virtual acalculia” with TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation). In Current Biology (2013), together with collaborators, he demonstrated that training combined with tRNS (transcranial random noise stimulation) yields improvements in learning and brain function lasting up to six months. More recently, in PLOS Biology (2025) and npj Digital Medicine (2025), his work has shown, respectively, mechanism-based modulation of mathematics learning gains via functional connectivity and GABAergic signaling, and the feasibility of home-based enhancement of sustained attention through AI-driven personalization.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Global Collaboration and Academic Ecosystem</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Academicians of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness hail from institutions such as Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Cambridge, the University of California, the French Academy of Sciences, the University of Padua, the University of Queensland, Columbia University, and the University of Exeter.

In Chemical Reviews (2008), he systematically summarized the mechanism, reaction conditions, and wide-ranging uses of CuAAC in peptide and polymer chemistry and in the functionalization of surfaces and nanostructures, establishing “click chemistry” as an efficient, robust, and combinatorial universal ligation paradigm. For “the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry,” he received the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (shared with K. Barry Sharpless and Carolyn R. Bertozzi).

This theory has been landmark in reconciling the early–late selection debate and in explaining distraction and misses in complex real-world environments. Building on this foundation, Professor Lavie leads UCL’s Attention and Cognitive Control laboratory in cross-disciplinary work spanning cognitive neuroscience, computational modeling, and applied settings (e.g., human–machine interaction in driving, distraction management in education), advancing a tight theory–evidence loop on the relationship between attention and consciousness.

He has long been committed to advancing the rule-of-law–based and internationalized development of the data-factor market. He is the first scholar globally to propose that the boundaries of international law in cyberspace sovereignty should be defined by the “right of cyber-territory” and to recommend incorporating this concept into the United Nations Charter. He took the lead in introducing such concepts as “data factor,” “data economy,” and “shared ownership of data,” which have been reviewed and registered by China’s national copyright authority. He argues that the value creation of data resources lies in the unity of use value and (exchange) value, and he advocates promoting the secure governance and innovative development of the data-factor market through the rule of law. In the development and utilization of public data resources, he has put forward regulatory proposals such as a “dynamic fair-competition review” for the public data-factor market, providing important theoretical support for authorized operations of public data and for fair competition. In the field of AI applications, he has argued that prompt engineering is the bridge of communication between humans and AI systems: humans must input carefully designed prompts so that AI can accurately understand human intent and efficiently perform various specific tasks. As Chief Data Officer, Professor Chunhui Wang will be responsible for building a compliant data-asset system and audit framework to support research on artificial consciousness, helping to achieve controllable, verifiable, and responsible development of artificial consciousness systems.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Global Collaboration and Academic Ecosystem</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>WAAC’s membership spans institutions such as Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Cambridge, the University of California, the French Academy of Sciences, the University of Padua, the University of Queensland, Columbia University, and the University of Exeter, covering countries and regions including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Canada, Australia, Spain, and China.

Together with his collaborators, he introduced the linear network coding framework, in which data packets are algebraically mixed at network nodes, thereby breaking through the traditional store-and-forward routing paradigm and dramatically improving transmission efficiency in multicast and other complex network scenarios. In the broader landscape of information science, he has systematically developed Algebraic Switching Theory, elevating switching network problems to a unified framework of abstract algebraic structures. His work on martingales of patterns, presented in representative publications such as A Martingale Approach to the Study of Occurrence of Sequence Patterns in Repeated Experiments, has been widely cited in textbooks and monographs on stochastic processes. Professor Li’s contributions to network coding and algebraic switching provide key mathematical languages for building highly reliable, high-throughput and interpretable intelligent infrastructures. His probabilistic perspective based on martingales of patterns offers powerful tools for understanding the predictability and explainability of complex behaviours and temporal patterns, laying a solid foundation for WAAC’s research agenda in artificial consciousness and intelligent systems.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Global Collaboration and Academic Ecosystem</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Academicians of the World Academy for Artificial Consciousness hail from institutions such as Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Cambridge, the University of California, the French Academy of Sciences, the University of Padua, the University of Queensland, Columbia University, and the University of Exeter.
